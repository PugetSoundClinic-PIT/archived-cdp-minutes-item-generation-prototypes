512,0.97,4106.602,4125.054,I'm calling to first of all thank the Councilmembers and committees and staff for listening to our concerns on the independent contractor protection ordinance and I want to urge the committee adopt proposed amendment one.,122,,
513,0.97,4125.054,4134.463,Drive forward does support that substitute bill and proposed amendment one for that substitute and amendment.,122,,
514,0.97,4134.463,4145.441,"Those protections are necessary for the independent contractors that are our members and gig workers that we represent, so we'd like you to support that amendment.",122,,
515,0.97,4145.441,4150.913,Thank you for your help and addressing our concerns on this bill.,122,,
516,0.97,4150.913,4153.048,"Thank you so much, everybody.",123,,
517,0.97,4153.048,4164.56,We had about 50 people who dialed in today and the agenda is packed.,123,,
518,0.97,4164.56,4169.431,So let's get right into it.,123,,
519,0.97,4169.431,4178.574,"Madame clerk, please read item one into the record.",123,,
520,0.97,4178.574,4200.93,"Before you do, I want to let folks know, Councilmember Sawant was also watching the hearing and would like to sign on to the letter for Ibew 46.",123,,
521,0.97,4200.93,4214.076,"Item number one, Councilmember 120093 and item two, bill 120094, ordinance related to the city's response to the Covid-19 crisis for briefing and discussion.",124,,
522,0.97,4214.076,4219.381,I see many friends joining us on the screen here.,125,,
523,0.97,4219.381,4234.229,"We have Julie from the city budget office, alley from central staff, who's been helping us create the recovery plan.",125,,
524,0.97,4234.229,4237.066,And I think I saw Tracy on there.,125,,
525,0.97,4237.066,4242.905,Thank you so much for the entire team at central staff and the city budget's office.,125,,
526,0.97,4242.905,4248.911,I want to call your attention to a few things on the agenda today.,125,,
527,0.97,4248.911,4252.748,You see a presentation and memo from central staff.,125,,
528,0.97,4252.748,4269.431,This is our opportunity as a city to apply much needed American rescue plan dollars city of assessment.,125,,
529,0.97,4271.567,4277.039,We have tried to have an expedited process with the American rescue plan act.,125,,
530,0.97,4277.039,4306.068,"In March we outlined the visions we'd like to see applied to these dollars and have had four meetings to discuss the Arpa distribution policies and learn the details about what the Federal government was allowing within these dollars, and be sure we included the voices from Community partners and organizations working with individuals who have been disproportionately impacted by the consequences of Covid.",125,,
531,0.97,4306.068,4320.516,"We have had a panel discussion with other cities, learning how they were applying the equity lens to their dollars and trying to find harmony and how we would apply these dollars.",125,,
532,0.97,4320.516,4343.338,"We have had interactions with community members, both with testimony and round table discussions.",125,,
533,0.97,4343.338,4351.547,Today we have bills in front of us that help appropriate the first American rescue plan dollars.,125,,
534,0.97,4351.547,4354.683,This is only $116 million.,125,,
535,0.97,4354.683,4386.115,"We are Pairing this with $12 million from the home and business partnership program, and $128 million is still not enough to address the profound needs in our community and incredible hardship so many have faced, both with the loss of lives, loss of livelihood, trauma people have been experiencing over the last year, and we want to create a more equitable economy.",125,,
536,0.97,4386.115,4395.824,This is the beginning of a path forward towards creating a more equitable Seattle as we speak to recover from the Harms of Covid.,125,,
537,0.97,4395.824,4400.696,I want to call out the way this bill was put together.,125,,
538,0.97,4400.696,4402.998,It was built off collaboration.,125,,
539,0.97,4402.998,4408.17,"Instead of individual priorities, this attempted to focus on the common good.",125,,
540,0.97,4408.17,4411.206,"Instead of politics, this bill focuses on policy.",125,,
541,0.97,4411.206,4428.991,This focuses on things we agree are much needed in our city and reflects engagement and discussion we have had with various community members.,125,,
542,0.97,4428.991,4435.43,This cannot completely address all the hardships people are experiencing but we are beginning to respond to the trauma.,125,,
543,0.97,4435.43,4445.24,We are beginning to respond to the housing needs and direct assistance for individuals and small businesses with this bill.,125,,
544,0.97,4445.24,4490.752,"We are trying to be sure we are having support on those who have been the most impacted by Covid, covered in the headlines as basically bearing the brunt of the consequences of Covid as front-line workers, small business owners, folks already dealing with inequitable health systems and the trauma that this crisis has created in the last year.",125,,
545,0.97,4490.752,4512.407,"We want to Prioritize and write in the language that the city Prioritizes and works with those programs that are culturally relevant and rooted in and founded by the individuals they work with, those disproportionately impacted by Covid and have leadership and board members and staff that reflect the community they serve.",125,,
546,0.97,4512.407,4530.726,This is something we have heard from other organizations and cities across the country.,125,,
547,0.97,4530.726,4532.995,There's a lot to highlight in this bill.,125,,
548,0.97,4532.995,4543.171,We'll have a conversation today about what's in the bill and you'll have a chance to ask questions and consider possible amendments that we hope will be Self-Balancing.,125,,
549,0.97,4543.171,4561.523,"We'd like you to identify those possible amendments by next Tuesday at noon so we have a full week for central staff to work on those amendments with you, collect feedback and give the public a chance to understand what's in those amendments so we can come back June 15th.",125,,
550,0.97,4561.523,4576.705,We'll have a discussion and either vote on the 15th or the 16th.,125,,
551,0.97,4576.705,4603.332,"And I want to thank my team again and central staff who worked on this, and the city budget office and Council President's office, and the Council President herself.",125,,
552,0.97,4603.332,4611.773,The Council President is with us today and I know is a huge proponent of the need to move on with the conversation as well.,125,,
553,0.97,4611.773,4624.653,I wanted to just offer those words on our behalf and see if she had anything to add before we turn it over to central staff.,125,,
554,0.97,4624.653,4624.853,Okay.,125,,
555,0.97,4624.853,4632.094,"Thanks again, Council President to you and your team for your incredible work on this.",125,,
556,0.97,4632.094,4648.01,Folks from our communication shop will be putting out Info Graphics so people can follow along with the details of the Seattle rescue plan.,125,,
557,0.97,4648.01,4664.659,Look forward to the discussion with members of the public as we speak to be sure those ideas are reflected in the final bill that's passed before the end of the month.,125,,
558,0.97,4664.659,4668.63,Welcome again to our panel.,125,,
559,0.97,4668.63,4670.098,"Good morning, members.",126,,
560,0.97,4670.098,4682.944,"Since the chair noted all the staffers, I think I'll just jump in if that's okay.",126,,
561,0.97,4682.944,4698.393,"Today we'll brief you on the proposed spending plan and contacts of the development of the proposal, then walk through the categories.",126,,
562,0.97,4698.393,4716.478,I also wanted to restate some of what Councilmember Mosqueda said.,126,,
563,0.97,4837.199,4850.579,"Just wanted to provide some context with the overall amp Arpa allocations, $1.85 trillion from the Federal Government.",126,,
564,0.97,4850.579,4860.522,"They are sending out money across the entire country to every state, territory, every County and every city.",126,,
565,0.97,4860.522,4867.929,So our allocation of these funds is in the Ecosystem of sources of funding.,126,,
566,0.97,4867.929,4889.15,"We wanted to show, also Seattle is receiving an incredible amount of money, some $300 million across various funding sources from Arpa over the next two years, potentially more, it pales in comparison to what the state and county are receiving.",126,,
567,0.97,4889.15,4890.151,We're tracking that.,126,,
568,0.97,4890.151,4895.657,We'll show you the comparison across the different levels of government.,126,,
569,0.97,4895.657,4916.211,"This is a bit more detailed view, showing you we have areas of high alignment in priorities across the city, County and state and how we are choosing to invest all the funds coming from the overall Arpa bill from the Feds.",126,,
570,0.97,4916.211,4921.883,Many of these have not been allocated from the county or the state.,126,,
571,0.97,4921.883,4941.136,"We still expect the city as a component of the county and state, we wanted to be strategic at looking at where the state and county had significant investment.",126,,
572,0.97,4941.136,4952.147,Maybe we didn't want to put as much of our dollars to that area of need.,126,,
573,0.97,4952.147,4960.922,This is just context overall to provide a window into all the moving parts over all the different levels of government.,126,,
574,0.97,4960.922,4963.591,Next slide.,126,,
575,0.97,4963.591,4966.361,"Thanks, Julie.",127,,
576,0.97,4966.361,4986.581,"So there are significant resources the state and county have provided and consistent with resolution 31999, the plan is to leverage those resources and be sure the city is also expanding the partnership with King County.",127,,
577,0.97,4986.581,5003.465,"This is just a few highlights of what's in the county's proposal, just to ill state some of those areas of funding.",127,,
578,0.97,5003.465,5013.608,"There's a significant investment from the county, so the city didn't identify a need to invest additional dollars in that area.",127,,
579,0.97,5013.608,5024.853,"As a different example, there was an opportunity to partner with the city on the use of $7.5 million of funds to establish a new homeless outreach program.",127,,
580,0.97,5024.853,5031.259,So the city's funds will match the proposed funding at the county level.,127,,
581,0.97,5031.259,5043.037,And note that highlighted the county's appropriation for rental assistance at $100 million and it's actually $140 million.,127,,
582,0.97,5043.037,5064.993,That's from an allocation King County received from the state and you'll recall the city recently passed an ordinance authorizing about $22 million that the city received directly from the December ordinance.,127,,
583,0.97,5064.993,5072.967,I'm happy to talk with members individually on other places where there's alignment.,127,,
584,0.97,5072.967,5077.439,"With that, I think we'll move into describing the development of the plan.",127,,
585,0.97,5077.439,5081.843,I want to Chime in and talk about the importance of that alignment.,128,,
586,0.97,5081.843,5089.017,We have talked about various programs that overlap with the county's priorities.,128,,
587,0.97,5089.017,5097.125,"What we really wanted to do in this proposal was not take an approach that said, the county's got that handle.",128,,
588,0.97,5097.125,5116.244,"Instead we wanted to say, where can we bring programs to scale to serve the deep needs we see across the city, as many areas need regional help.",128,,
589,0.97,5116.244,5136.03,"To the degree we saw the county was providing X amount and relieved us from providing all of the dollars, that allows us to do extra support in the city where the county dollars won't get to.",128,,
590,0.97,5136.03,5149.144,So I appreciate the chair of the budget committee for the proposal.,128,,
591,0.97,5149.144,5159.42,I think it's a good partnership.,128,,
592,0.97,5159.42,5160.955,"Councilmember Herbold, go ahead.",128,,
593,0.97,5160.955,5173.234,"I just want to highlight, I'm not sure if it's on this page or another slide.",129,,
594,0.97,5173.234,5190.185,"But slide four shows that the county invested about $51.5 million in arts and culture recovery, but we don't have a lot of detail on how those dollars are being invested.",129,,
595,0.97,5190.185,5203.531,I want to share with the committee and the public what I have learned from the Seattle arts Commission about the King County investment.,129,,
596,0.97,5203.531,5224.385,"In meeting with Dr. Morris, I've learned that while King County is investing at a high level for the arts, the allocation focuses on large and independent music and movie Venues and the concern is that they will leave out many small organizations.",129,,
597,0.97,5224.385,5242.937,$20Million of this funding is specifically for independent music and movie Venues and only $8 million is earmarked for small and Mid-Size organizations.,129,,
598,0.97,5242.937,5263.625,"So I wanted to flag that as it relates to the generous and helpful County investment in the arts, but also wanting to identify a gap that I'm looking forward to seeing how our investment in artists and cultural workers can help.",129,,
599,0.97,5263.625,5263.958,Thank you.,129,,
600,0.97,5263.958,5267.495,Thanks so much.,130,,
601,0.97,5267.495,5273.301,We'll continue to see additional information from the county as well.,130,,
602,0.97,5273.301,5274.135,Thanks for that.,130,,
603,0.97,5274.135,5282.543,I want to Orient folks to the process here.,130,,
604,0.97,5282.543,5284.078,I do see a slide member.,130,,
605,0.97,5284.078,5284.646,I do.,131,,
606,0.97,5284.646,5316.144,"And you'll see there's a Color-Coded grid that corresponds with the category, so I'll ask you to stay with your category provided in the opening comments.",132,,
607,0.97,5316.144,5325.086,Hold your comments until the end of the section.,132,,
608,0.97,5325.086,5325.52,Let's go ahead.,132,,
609,0.97,5325.52,5328.222,Thank you so much.,133,,
610,0.97,5328.222,5374.635,"I wanted to highlight--I know the chair outlined this at the top but more on the development of the Seattle rescue plan one, because we anticipate additional bills to come through.",133,,
611,0.97,5374.635,5392.186,We health Department a community panel with organizations and the public hearing on May 4TH as well as the meetings in April and May.,133,,
612,0.97,5398.126,5423.785,"It was clear there was a lot of spending alignment between the Mayor Council, supporting those who are Unhoused, small businesses and neighborhood recovery, direct assistance and other supports to the community in like education, Reopenig city services and other services.",134,,
613,0.97,5423.785,5433.594,"We want to restate the alignment between what we're hearing from the public, the Mayor and the Council.",134,,
614,0.97,5433.594,5454.282,"So before we jump into going into each category that's within the rescue plan, we just want to highlight the policy intent that's meant to guide the categories.",135,,
615,0.97,5454.282,5471.332,"There's trying to address the short and long-term impacts of the pandemic, really building on the investments funded in the Covid relief plan last year and other efforts the city took up last year.",135,,
616,0.97,5471.332,5500.428,And the legislation provides direct information and really focuses on those disproportionately impacted by Covid-19 and all the services and direct assistance that's funded with this plan.,135,,
617,0.97,5500.428,5520.147,"The rest of the presentation is Color-Coded, so each category here, we'll walk through the details and pause for questions at the end.",135,,
618,0.97,5520.147,5530.424,With that I'll hand it over to Julie to start describing the proposed investing in housing and homelessness.,135,,
619,0.97,5530.424,5540.534,"Overall looking at $49.2 million in housing and homelessness, targeted toward permanent housing and resources for emergency housing and shelter services.",136,,
620,0.97,5540.534,5546.407,I'll do the first part.,136,,
621,0.97,5546.407,5546.741,Next slide.,136,,
622,0.97,5546.741,5547.041,Thank you.,136,,
623,0.97,5547.041,5570.765,Permanent housing capital $28.5 million to acquire and build 300 permanent affordable housing units in 2021 and 2022.,136,,
624,0.97,5572.366,5579.507,"We estimate this could create about 300 units overall, looking to target those in acquisition.",136,,
625,0.97,5579.507,5584.979,I'll talk about policy intent on the next slide.,136,,
626,0.97,5584.979,5596.958,We're looking to provide at least $40 million for affordable housing capital.,136,,
627,0.97,5596.958,5616.677,This bill doesn't have the full amount so we'll need another investment in 2022 to get to that $40 million.,136,,
628,0.97,5616.677,5626.454,This will include permanent supportive housing and housing incomes at or below 50% of the median income.,136,,
629,0.97,5626.454,5638.566,"And we are working with nonprofit organizations that are historically rooted, particularly when that area is in high risk for displacement.",136,,
630,0.97,5638.566,5650.811,These areas are highly in line with the guidance that came out from the Biden administration as the rule for the funds overall.,136,,
631,0.97,5650.811,5669.93,"In the housing area, these are a mix of Coronavirus funds and direct targeted business dollars.",136,,
632,0.97,5669.93,5671.332,Next slide.,136,,
633,0.97,5671.332,5686.747,"The focus overall with this investment is increasing shelter spaces that exist, and families can get into permanent housing, creating more access.",137,,
634,0.97,5686.747,5697.725,It would be a faster process than going through the process of creating a new tiny home or shelter.,137,,
635,0.97,5697.725,5713.274,"We estimate $6.7 million would serve 685 households, up to 12 months.",137,,
636,0.97,5713.274,5725.052,The next item is similar in that it doesn't try to create new shelter beds.,137,,
637,0.97,5725.052,5759.12,"The diversion funds can be a centralized pot so as soon as a family begins to experience homelessness, the mediation or financial counseling or assistance to prevent that household from becoming homeless, or allowing the family or individual to stabilize and identify the means that they could quickly move out and providing those funds so they are not experiencing long-term homelessness.",137,,
638,0.97,5759.12,5763.09,These are the first two pieces.,137,,
639,0.97,5763.09,5785.079,The county is undertaking the process to support a model similar to what's highlighted by just care.,137,,
640,0.97,5785.079,5797.258,"And there will be 25 Rvs in different locations, and based on the management and needs, we can make these lots function.",137,,
641,0.97,5797.258,5813.774,"This estimate has been developed largely off prior experience with the city from 2016, when Rv safe lots were initially highlighted.",137,,
642,0.97,5813.774,5825.052,"The state has provided capital funding, $2 million to expand the tiny home villages.",137,,
643,0.97,5825.052,5838.699,And this includes $400 more to operate those villages.,137,,
644,0.97,5838.699,5849.109,This funding is to match what's provided by the state to provide the initial operations.,137,,
645,0.97,5849.109,5855.85,Then finally there's capacity building for agencies.,137,,
646,0.97,5855.85,5865.826,"As Councilmembers have heard, the capacity of our homeless service providers is really being stretched.",137,,
647,0.97,5865.826,5890.384,This would help permanent supportive and Nonpermanent supportive staffing to expand their capability and take on the added investments.,137,,
648,0.97,5890.384,5894.321,And we're happy to take questions.,138,,
649,0.97,5894.321,5894.655,Wonderful.,139,,
650,0.97,5894.655,5901.362,I see a few folks Online.,139,,
651,0.97,5901.362,5939.433,I'm really excited about the initial investments here.,139,,
652,0.97,5942.069,5968.796,"I think when I've talked to those folks working on scale lots, we recognize there are different models of how much assistance is provided on site.",139,,
653,0.97,5968.796,5974.134,We are looking at three new tiny House villages by the end of the year.,139,,
654,0.97,5974.134,5991.251,I want to recognize this alone is not enough to address the crisis in terms of housing and homelessness but this is a good overview of the investments I hope we build on.,139,,
655,0.97,5991.251,5998.425,I'm going to call folks in the order that I saw you pop up here.,139,,
656,0.97,5998.425,5998.926,Councilmember Morales?,139,,
657,0.97,5998.926,6003.297,I have several questions for this section.,140,,
658,0.97,6003.297,6009.703,Should I read them all?,140,,
659,0.97,6009.703,6012.573,Sure.,141,,
660,0.97,6012.573,6013.04,Okay.,142,,
661,0.97,6013.04,6021.982,A couple have already been answered.,142,,
662,0.97,6021.982,6028.789,I'm glad to know that the intent is to be able to provide it for up to 12 months.,142,,
663,0.97,6028.789,6046.673,"I think that's the key piece if we keep something like this in, because we know providing vouchers for a month or two when rent is so high isn't that helpful.",142,,
664,0.97,6046.673,6052.513,I'm happy to see we're going up to 12 months.,142,,
665,0.97,6052.513,6064.625,I'll move on to the capacity building.,142,,
666,0.97,6064.625,6075.369,"I'm interested to know what kind of service or support are we offering and how many providers would be able to access the funds, and how do they access the funds?",142,,
667,0.97,6075.369,6106.333,"I'll say right now, a big concern I have with the way this seems to be laid out, we know that small organizations in communities of color struggle with having to apply repeatedly for small amounts of money that don't have a huge impact.",142,,
668,0.97,6106.333,6120.481,"Then the last question about the tiny House villages, Jeff, could you tell us what those two budget actions are for?",142,,
669,0.97,6120.481,6124.618,They count for adding in 2021 to expand.,143,,
670,0.97,6124.618,6147.04,"One added one new village that will be up and then the other one added two new villages, one I believe on the North end and I don't believe we have the final location of the other.",143,,
671,0.97,6147.04,6153.514,"So first of all, why aren't those funds already allocated?",144,,
672,0.97,6153.514,6165.425,I worry here they're being Repurposed for something else.,144,,
673,0.97,6166.793,6168.896,It's only June.,144,,
674,0.97,6168.896,6176.403,"If they're being Repurposed, we're trying to figure out what's happening there.",144,,
675,0.97,6176.403,6182.743,"Sure, I can see some confusion there.",145,,
676,0.97,6182.743,6194.221,"These assumed the full $600,000 start-up cost for each village and $800,000 for a full year.",145,,
677,0.97,6194.221,6202.829,None of them came Online January 1 and two are still waiting to come Online.,145,,
678,0.97,6202.829,6223.85,"So it's not that there hasn't been activity to move forward on that, but since we provided dollars for January through May, those funds will be able to support the city villages.",145,,
679,0.97,6223.85,6224.117,Okay.,146,,
680,0.97,6224.117,6228.956,I'll probably follow up with you on that.,146,,
681,0.97,6228.956,6251.511,We have had a group requesting those funds so they can stand up and haven't gotten very far in that conversation.,146,,
682,0.97,6251.511,6260.554,Do you want to talk about the capacity and housing providers?,147,,
683,0.97,6260.554,6266.26,The $4.3 million is split between the human services Department and office of housing.,148,,
684,0.97,6266.26,6276.069,Some of the funds will go to support homeless service providers.,148,,
685,0.97,6276.069,6280.941,It's meant to provide capacity and to stabilize staffing.,148,,
686,0.97,6280.941,6291.084,My understanding is it would be somewhat flexible to support the needs of the different organizations.,148,,
687,0.97,6291.084,6293.12,Julie may speak to the distribution.,148,,
688,0.97,6293.12,6301.595,It's sometimes easier to get the dollars out the door as we are expanding and existing project.,148,,
689,0.97,6301.595,6308.635,The other half would go to the office of housing to provide assistance to housing providers.,148,,
690,0.97,6308.635,6335.262,That could include both support for staffing and capacity as well as the enhanced services the providers are increasingly needing funding for.,148,,
691,0.97,6335.262,6336.096,You nailed it.,149,,
692,0.97,6336.096,6338.732,Our process is still to be determined.,149,,
693,0.97,6338.732,6345.439,We don't know what the scale of the investment is going to end with.,149,,
694,0.97,6345.439,6358.385,"As you are all discussing this package, it would be going to current contract holders.",149,,
695,0.97,6358.385,6364.124,We'd like to do that in the most streamlined way possible.,149,,
696,0.97,6364.124,6369.796,"I think of the questions I noted, I think we answered them.",150,,
697,0.97,6369.796,6373.667,Please let me know if I missed something.,150,,
698,0.97,6373.667,6374.201,I think that was all.,151,,
699,0.97,6374.201,6375.635,Thank you so much.,151,,
700,0.97,6375.635,6377.037,Thank you.,152,,
701,0.97,6377.037,6378.138,Great questions.,153,,
702,0.97,6378.138,6384.311,I similarly had questions about the allocation so I appreciate you raising those.,153,,
703,0.97,6384.311,6385.679,Councilmember Herbold then Councilmember Lewis.,153,,
704,0.97,6397.657,6400.694,Thank you so much.,154,,
705,0.97,6400.694,6419.179,"One question relates to how the rapid Rehousing and diversion funds will be allocated, which populations will be Prioritized and which organizations will be given access to the funds to offer their clients.",154,,
706,0.97,6419.179,6432.492,"As described, seems like the diversion funds are going to diverting homelessness, not helping those who already receive it.",154,,
707,0.97,6432.492,6457.717,"There's a lot of complexity on how to appropriately use diversion funds, because it may look like they could become homeless, but we don't have a lot of certainty that without those funds they will become homeless.",154,,
708,0.97,6457.717,6476.736,Historically diversion funds have been focused at that moment in time when somebody has just become homeless.,154,,
709,0.97,6476.736,6494.554,"On the enhanced shelter, I'm pleased we are looking at this again.",154,,
710,0.97,6494.554,6505.232,Several years ago we recognized the costs associated with the safe lots.,154,,
711,0.97,6505.232,6522.382,"One idea we were exploring a couple years ago is in addition to looking at an Rv safe lot, a transition to permanent supportive housing could be an Rv safe lot for just storage of the Rv.",154,,
712,0.97,6522.382,6546.406,"So you know, often people who live in Rvs are people who have been Unstably housed for a very long time, and this is their most valuable possession.",154,,
713,0.97,6546.406,6550.61,They feel it's risky and have concerns about becoming homeless again.,154,,
714,0.97,6550.61,6582.475,I'm interested in exploring whether or not we can look at a place to store people's Rvs as a way to give them some insurance and security that they are not going to lose their Rv in this period of time when they're building trust in becoming a permanent housing resident and getting that security.,154,,
715,0.97,6603.964,6610.203,I think I can start with the first of those.,155,,
716,0.97,6610.203,6638.398,"The rapid Rehousing dollars, we hadn't Delved into the specific mechanism to get the funds out.",155,,
717,0.97,6638.398,6650.61,"The city's dollars in the past have been provided to those in shelters already, so there's no question they were experiencing homelessness.",155,,
718,0.97,6650.61,6652.178,They're in a shelter.,155,,
719,0.97,6652.178,6674.334,"Assistance can be financial or case management, mediation, things like that, to occur within 30 days of a shelter stay to divert that household from a longer term experience.",155,,
720,0.97,6674.334,6698.858,"And it's managed, and we have not specified which Pathway would be followed with these funds, only that out losing this as a mechanism to create that so they are moving into housing and we can serve more households more quickly.",155,,
721,0.97,6698.858,6705.932,"Then the third question regarding the safe lots, this didn't Envegas an Rv storage lot.",155,,
722,0.97,6705.932,6729.556,"It was built off the experience in 2016, which was rather brief, where about $25,000 was utilized to stand up a lot and there's a various of services.",155,,
723,0.97,6729.556,6738.498,"There needs to be case management, obviously the basic hygiene needs and things like that.",155,,
724,0.97,6738.498,6753.113,But that's not what was prepared here at this point.,155,,
725,0.97,6778.404,6779.239,Thank you.,156,,
726,0.97,6779.239,6798.525,And I think this is especially important as we heard from others concerned about the 72- hour policy and how that's applied to make sure there's a safe place for folks to go.,156,,
727,0.97,6798.525,6799.692,Appreciate the conversation.,156,,
728,0.97,6799.692,6811.371,I'll turn it over to Councilmember Lewis.,156,,
729,0.97,6811.371,6815.108,Thank you so much.,157,,
730,0.97,6815.108,6822.749,I think I can respond on the tiny House questions.,157,,
731,0.97,6822.749,6832.759,"It would probably be a good subject for the month, a select Committee on what's going on with the whole world of tiny houses.",157,,
732,0.97,6832.759,6856.549,"There's been a lot of frustrating stuff with the three new villages that we funded last fall, some in the city's control and some others that need to get approval from other governments.",157,,
733,0.97,6856.549,6922.148,"I can say for the first three village sites, my understanding is that, you know, the site at Roosevelt and 45Th, the site up in North Seattle at the old black Angus motor Inn, and the expansion with the tiny houses at inner Bay, that those three are pretty baked in already as a response to an Rfq issued earlier this year.",157,,
734,0.97,6922.148,6932.058,We're happy to try and be sure that that's transparent and accessible so everyone can benefit from that.,157,,
735,0.97,6932.058,6939.165,I would like to see a lot more tiny House villages.,157,,
736,0.97,6939.165,6946.939,"You know, we have resources and we have sites to put up more tiny House villages.",157,,
737,0.97,6946.939,6958.985,"A lot of regional partners like the port of Seattle, sound transit, they have been very helpful.",157,,
738,0.97,6958.985,6971.698,"Private landowners we have made contact with, we have tons of sites.",157,,
739,0.97,6971.698,6991.884,"One issue has been, because we are in the flux of this transition between the city managing all this and then the King County homelessness authority, there are gaps and the team is overworked to get this going.",157,,
740,0.97,6991.884,7013.706,Is it still part of the package that we're going to include a requirement that the human services Department aggregate and start getting these sites to be prepared as resources become available to add more villages as the money comes in?,157,,
741,0.97,7013.706,7044.837,"One of the current problems I've seen is the human services Department don't go and evaluate but if there was just a list of sites, as money became available, we could just move more quickly instead of starting with ground zero and everything else.",157,,
742,0.97,7044.837,7063.423,"I wanted to confirm that's in the final package here, requiring that to be created.",157,,
743,0.97,7063.423,7065.057,That's my first question.,157,,
744,0.97,7065.057,7068.694,"Yeah, thank you, Councilmember Lewis.",158,,
745,0.97,7068.694,7092.819,The legislation does include the Council's intent and request to assess and do initial work with the assumption that no fewer than nine new tiny home villages will be supported by the fund.,158,,
746,0.97,7092.819,7100.46,I'll note that it's a request the Department takes this up.,158,,
747,0.97,7100.46,7106.632,There's no mechanism for the Council to require that specifically.,158,,
748,0.97,7106.632,7111.17,It was included in section 8K.,158,,
749,0.97,7111.17,7111.471,Great.,159,,
750,0.97,7111.471,7111.838,Thank you.,159,,
751,0.97,7111.838,7145.938,"I will also, just to assert publicly, my office has far more than nine completely suitable sites, as well as support from community organizations, chambers of Commerce, business improvement district boards, community councils demanding and requesting tiny House villages in their own neighborhoods, specifically citing some of these sites.",159,,
752,0.97,7145.938,7179.372,"So if the human services Department is listening, we are looking forward to working on developing that list and stand ready to continue to share those sites and continue to make progress on that.",159,,
753,0.97,7179.372,7201.06,I recently took a tour of where the expansion will be and heard the lease change will potentially require Council action.,159,,
754,0.97,7201.06,7236.262,I just wonder if we're in a position to spur along whatever would be required because the board is ready to move forward on this.,159,,
755,0.97,7236.262,7239.432,I'll have to get back to you.,160,,
756,0.97,7239.432,7254.914,"We have not received anything at this point requesting that, and normally it would be the Mayor generating that piece of legislation.",160,,
757,0.97,7254.914,7260.219,"Great, thank you so much.",161,,
758,0.97,7260.219,7268.794,I want to make a few closing comments here but I don't have any more questions.,161,,
759,0.97,7268.794,7286.212,"I want to say, you know, I think one of the issues with the homelessness investments in this package, some are not going until the fall or late summer.",161,,
760,0.97,7286.212,7289.515,There could be a sequencing issue in two records.,161,,
761,0.97,7289.515,7300.259,I'm talking mostly to all the folks that called in from the provider communities today.,161,,
762,0.97,7300.259,7311.57,"You know, I think there's some capacity issues that are more near-term for the struggle that a lot of organizations are seeing.",161,,
763,0.97,7311.57,7331.29,"I think there's also a lot of pressure for those organizations to deliver around certain mandate and plans around the reopening of downtown for work, and tourism for that matter.",161,,
764,0.97,7331.29,7355.181,"Cruise ships will be returning in July, and there's a push to access resources for a lot of our neighbors experiencing homelessness who should be in enhanced shelter instead of being forced to live in tents.",161,,
765,0.97,7355.181,7371.297,"The reason I bring this up, I think we need an interim strategy before a lot of this stuff comes Online.",161,,
766,0.97,7371.297,7379.572,The Council approved in the late winter $12 million of spend authority.,161,,
767,0.97,7379.572,7393.152,The intention behind that was that that money would go out the door then later be federally reimbursed through FEMA or some sort of Federal plan.,161,,
768,0.97,7393.152,7408.334,I don't believe that spending authority has been taken advantage of by any organization to this date.,161,,
769,0.97,7408.334,7444.236,"We have gotten a lot not really more guidance and there are other sources of funding coming down the line that could reimburse that $12 million, so I'm announcing today that on Monday, I'm intending to amend that spend authority in order to make it more flexible so that we can get it out the door and plan to reimburse it through additional things we were not aware of that are now becoming possible.",161,,
770,0.97,7444.236,7457.383,"You know, increased general fund revenue from the recovery of the general fund above what we planned for.",161,,
771,0.97,7457.383,7494.32,There is a state reimbursement gap filling measure that was passed to help fill in what we believe is FEMA Reimbursable to see if we can get that out to the providers doing this work.,161,,
772,0.97,7494.32,7496.856,That is spend authority that's currently available.,161,,
773,0.97,7496.856,7502.061,The Council doesn't have to wait for anything to come through.,161,,
774,0.97,7502.061,7521.113,That spend authority could be used any time by our partners on the executive side if we loosen it up a little more.,161,,
775,0.97,7521.113,7531.357,"I think that would be a good request, to really lean into those things.",161,,
776,0.97,7531.357,7554.446,I wanted to flag my intention to introduce something like that on Monday and move forward and see if we can front load more of this resource in the package.,161,,
777,0.97,7554.446,7566.892,"Thanks for letting me take a lot of committee time on that, but I think it's important that there is another resource and we can innovate around getting that out.",161,,
778,0.97,7566.892,7573.132,"Thank you so much, Councilmember Lewis.",162,,
779,0.97,7573.132,7593.052,Obviously I'm very supportive of that effort as well.,162,,
780,0.97,7597.022,7623.215,We'll be looking at various revenue streams to continue to make investments in all these categories.,162,,
781,0.97,7623.215,7641.967,We'll have time to review the presentation before the June 15th meeting and then we'll Havemore time.,162,,
782,0.97,7641.967,7650.943,I think it was fair to have extra time talking about homelessness.,162,,
783,0.97,7650.943,7672.598,"I want to note within the office of housing presentation, there are policy changes and allowing for the office to have more acquisition authority to purchase more buildings that can be used for shelter and permanent supportive housing.",162,,
784,0.97,7672.598,7680.639,We'll talk about that on the 15th.,162,,
785,0.97,7680.639,7682.408,Thanks to the team here.,162,,
786,0.97,7682.408,7690.649,We're going to wrap up the conversation on housing and homelessness.,162,,
787,0.97,7690.649,7695.387,Any other questions on this section?,162,,
788,0.97,7695.387,7696.955,Thank you.,163,,
789,0.97,7696.955,7737.229,"I did want to follow up on the comments that Councilmember Lewis just made, because I'm supportive and I understand his interest in bringing back the legislation that we passed in order to deal with the questions around the FEMA reimbursement and supporting those funds to help more with hotel investments and tiny House villages.",163,,
790,0.97,7737.229,7761.053,"He referred to the public comment from lead, and we have all received a request around their 2021 budget needs.",163,,
791,0.97,7761.053,7773.098,"I just want to understand, are you suggesting we address that additional identified need in the other bill?",163,,
792,0.97,7773.098,7776.468,"That's a good question, Councilmember Herbold.",164,,
793,0.97,7776.468,7783.775,I think what I was suggesting is we could explore that for sure.,164,,
794,0.97,7783.775,7789.014,It would be an eligible use of that spend authority.,164,,
795,0.97,7789.014,7809.735,I think there's a number of things we could do.,164,,
796,0.97,7809.735,7830.088,"A lot of things that would have been open have been a case transfer to lead, which is why they're experiencing more costs and why other institutions are finding savings.",164,,
797,0.97,7830.088,7837.596,Maybe there's a way to find Savings and reflect what the demand was as well.,164,,
798,0.97,7837.596,7841.5,I think there's a number of different places we could find the resource.,164,,
799,0.97,7841.5,7858.85,"I think some of that could get cleaned up when we're doing the budget in the fall, and we could front load it with what we approved in the winter essentially.",164,,
800,0.97,7858.85,7861.52,"We have to keep moving, folks.",165,,
801,0.97,7861.52,7882.307,I'm asking about this now because I'm exploring with central staff whether or not this is an eligible--whether lead funding is an eligible use for this particular bill.,166,,

814,0.97,8032.891,8050.842,"As an example of how far the dollars could stretch, our rough estimate is it could provide over 10,000 House olds with $2,000 in cash assistance, allowing people to make their own decisions about how to best use those funds.",169,,
815,0.97,8050.842,8070.028,That was an but it is about the average allocation provided to Huseholds through the program.,169,,

818,0.97,8093.118,8124.983,The human services Department is aware of 15 services and there's certainly a need for these dollars to support the capital investments and developments for the communities that have experienced barriers to capital.,169,,
819,0.97,8124.983,8137.662,"This would provide cash assistance or recognition pay to child care workers, recognizing the essential services they have provided during the pandemic.",169,,
820,0.97,8137.662,8148.373,This could be for child care workers caring for children and enabling parents to participate in the work force.,169,,

848,0.97,8449.641,8459.15,"Then regarding the youth equity, I agree that Seattle promise is a great way to support access to higher education not really young people.",171,,
849,0.97,8459.15,8476.768,"Given the impacts of Covid and some of the disruption it's caused for young people trying to navigate their education right now, I'm also interested in how we support youth who plan to go to college.",171,,

854,0.97,8535.793,8549.807,"$500,000 over several organizations, I worry these will be small investments.",171,,
855,0.97,8549.807,8566.19,"How to be sure this is equitable, access to it is equitable.",171,,
856,0.97,8566.19,8574.699,"I think for me,, this is an example of the challenge of using big Federal money in a way that has meaningful impact on individuals.",171,,
857,0.97,8574.699,8600.758,"I wonder if there might be a bigger impact if we use those funds in a different way, still for young people but maybe not mini grants for organizations, but get the people directly to the young people.",171,,
858,0.97,8600.758,8604.929,I want to signal I'm having a hard time with this.,171,,

863,0.97,8661.753,8679.737,I think it's a combination of longer term and one-time types of support.,172,,
864,0.97,8679.737,8711.035,"There would be $300,000 to the office of economic development, specifically to provide computers and subsidize Wi-Fi to individuals.",172,,
865,0.97,8711.035,8749.006,"A. I think some of these need to expand what the city is already doing with these funds, and I think it's a difficult choice for you policy makers to grapple with in the coming weeks . I will also just NOTE the Digital equity is coming up as a high priority for investments to use.",172,,
866,0.97,8749.006,8769.227,"In terms of the mini grants for the preemployment programs, I'll see if we have additional information on that.",172,,

878,0.97,8884.475,8903.094,"I want to lift up that, as part of--our intent is signaled in this resolution that identified our priorities.",177,,
879,0.97,8903.094,8940.164,There is no money in this bill related to that particular commitment because I understand that we are intending to allocate $1.5 million to address senior isolation as part of the upcoming $7.4 million investment in seniors expected from the state later this summer.,177,,
880,0.97,8940.164,8948.506,So I want to lift that up.,177,,
881,0.97,8948.506,8980.471,"And the direct payment section for addressing the priority investment on the financial assistance for small and Microbusinesses, the resolution 31999 that we passed does reference artists in this area and artists among the hardest hit by the impact.",177,,
882,0.97,8980.471,8988.979,I want to focus on the impact to artists themselves.,177,,
883,0.97,8988.979,9007.365,74% of local arts and cultural organizations furloughed staff over the last 14 months.,177,,
884,0.97,9007.365,9025.383,"According to Washington state, the highest percentage of losses in employment in King County have been in arts, entertainment and recreation.",177,,
885,0.97,9025.383,9040.998,Americans for the arts report 37% of their members have been unable to access food at some point and 48% didn't see a medical professional because of the inability to pay.,177,,
886,0.97,9040.998,9048.539,I want to be sure these direct cash system funds are available and accessible.,177,,
887,0.97,9048.539,9067.124,"Artists and arts and culture workers impacted by Covid, the Seattle arts Commission is recommending that we focus a significant portion of these dollars on artists.",177,,
888,0.97,9067.124,9084.141,I think a really good place to start is by ensuring that the organizations we are charging for getting these dollars out the door are table serve this particular need as well.,177,,
889,0.97,9084.141,9098.956,"With the direct assistance funds, we have in the past supported Wellspring, getting out the dollars for hospitality workers, getting out the dollars for a priority population.",177,,
890,0.97,9098.956,9104.462,I want to know how we're going to do that for artists as well.,177,,
891,0.97,9104.462,9106.23,Thank you so much.,178,,
892,0.97,9106.23,9114.572,"Alley, your answer is quality control as well.",178,,
893,0.97,9114.572,9130.788,The language in section eight directive to channel the dollars exactly as supplied and individuals working in the creative economy.,178,,
894,0.97,9130.788,9145.169,"That's the term they prefer for those artists, musicians, et cetera.",178,,
895,0.97,9145.169,9156.58,"We do need to be sure those disproportionately impacted by Covid, it needs to be followed through on.",178,,
896,0.97,9156.58,9164.388,The intent is there and we need to follow through on that.,178,,
897,0.97,9164.388,9181.572,"I just wanted to note that the legislation for the direct cash assistance program doesn't specifically call out artists or people in the creative industry, but if that is a priority for the Council, I'm happy to add some language.",179,,
898,0.97,9181.572,9195.419,"I will note that as we were looking at the total package in the cash assistance, it could get very big or smaller depended how targeted or not targeted it is.",179,,
899,0.97,9195.419,9211.068,At some point I think there will need to be clarity on the highest priority in terms of who to focus on and community organizations to partner with.,179,,
900,0.97,9211.068,9214.939,That may change how the implementation occurs.,179,,
901,0.97,9214.939,9216.607,Happy to talk about that.,179,,
902,0.97,9216.607,9225.649,And I want to emphasize section eight is guiding language for the entire bill.,180,,
903,0.97,9225.649,9254.645,"So while it may not be specific in housing or cash assistance, that entire section is supposed to be the directive of how we hope every allocation is channeled.",180,,
904,0.97,9254.645,9259.116,We look forward to doing that.,180,,
905,0.97,9259.116,9272.529,I think it was probably my loss in not carrying the language into both bills.,181,,
906,0.97,9272.529,9272.83,Okay.,182,,
907,0.97,9272.83,9275.332,Thank you for that.,182,,

910,0.97,9286.11,9294.818,"Community and small business recovery, and then the last two remaining items together.",182,,
911,0.97,9294.818,9312.136,"The next category is community and small business recovery, $23 million proposed in this category with the biggest investment of being a $22 million proposed investment for neighborhood and downtown recovery efforts.",183,,
912,0.97,9312.136,9330.254,"Like the Overarching guidance for this category, the funds are to Prioritize those who have experienced other barriers to financial assistance and supporting new businesses launched by workers forced to quit their jobs as a result of the pandemic.",183,,
913,0.97,9330.254,9340.397,The funds are meant to be used for several types of investment strategies.,183,,
914,0.97,9340.397,9352.91,This is sort of building around the small business stabilization fund but looking at flexibility and size of grants and that type of thing.,183,,
915,0.97,9352.91,9362.753,"As a point of reference, the fund Districted over $10 million in grants to about 1500 small businesses and economic opportunity Nonprofits.",183,,
916,0.97,9362.753,9372.963,Next slide.,183,,
917,0.97,9437.06,9470.594,Just note that the grants for neighborhood and downtown recovery will be focusing on the equity and neighborhoods investments program where they have really over the last several years focused on those equity neighborhoods.,183,,
918,0.97,9471.595,9500.858,"And there's a million dollars for job training, including $500,000 to help support displaced workers and $500,000 for a partnership with the port of Seattle to provide Internship opportunities for Bipoc youth.",183,,
919,0.97,9500.858,9503.594,And that was the community and small business recovery section.,183,,
920,0.97,9503.594,9504.561,Happy to take questions.,183,,
921,0.97,9504.561,9512.536,Thank you so much.,184,,
922,0.97,9512.536,9528.952,I see a hand from Councilmember Morales.,184,,

925,0.97,9535.125,9536.527,Thank you.,185,,
926,0.97,9536.527,9543.734,This is obviously a very important section for me.,185,,
927,0.97,9543.734,9548.338,I think there's a lot of really good stuff in here.,185,,
928,0.97,9548.338,9561.184,"Having the technical assistance, being able to leverage that will be critical to the recovery, especially for our small and Microentrepreneurs.",185,,
929,0.97,9561.184,9576.733,"We have heard over and over again that the real push for those small businesses is to get technical assistance to help them grow, so really excited to see that.",185,,
930,0.97,9576.733,9587.444,I've had conversations with Oed and folks in the planning Department so I'm curious about the affordable commercial space.,185,,
931,0.97,9587.444,9595.852,It's important for black and Brown business owners to have affordable commercial space.,185,,
932,0.97,9595.852,9610.534,"We know when rent is $10,000 a month, I'm curious about what the impact here could Beand whether it's meant to be a rent subsidy.",185,,
933,0.97,9610.534,9623.78,"Really the scale of what we can offer is not big enough to do something like that, so I would like more clarity on what that means.",185,,
934,0.97,9623.78,9630.087,The small business stabilization fund was hugely important to helping small businesses in the last year.,185,,
935,0.97,9630.087,9644.334,"I'm really glad to see that includes artists and art organizations, and we know Oed was already Understaffed to try and move this money out.",185,,
936,0.97,9644.334,9657.914,"They don't have contractors and grant specialists on staff, so I'm worried about their capacity to move twice as much money out the door.",185,,
937,0.97,9657.914,9663.387,I think it's important to note they lack the capacity to do this right now.,185,,
938,0.97,9663.387,9686.643,"Then I don't want to quibble, but I think if what we really want to do here is leverage this one-time infusion of Federal dollars into building community wealth, I believe we need to see more money supporting acquisition by community members so they actually own some assets.",185,,
939,0.97,9686.643,9689.146,We're talking about Renters.,185,,
940,0.97,9689.146,9697.02,"Someone else owns the property, and therefore the community wealth that comes with it.",185,,
941,0.97,9697.02,9717.307,I would really like to see us increase the pot a little for more acquisition for the Community-Based organizations so they can really drive the kind of development that happens in their neighborhoods and actually own that for community benefit.,185,,
942,0.97,9717.307,9718.275,That's all I have.,185,,
943,0.97,9718.275,9723.28,Thank you.,185,,

945,0.97,9726.95,9727.217,Comments?,186,,
946,0.97,9727.217,9734.491,I think it was really about getting into the details about how the different dollars will be allocated.,187,,
947,0.97,9734.491,9761.718,"So we have not had an opportunity to really look at or dig into what the office of economic development may be proposing for the allocation, so we'll get that information and get that out to you.",187,,
948,0.97,9761.718,9770.494,"I think in terms of the commercial Affordability, it's a challenge in terms of the size of the investment and how far those dollars can stretch.",187,,
949,0.97,9770.494,9795.652,One of the pieces discussed is also looking at support legal support for long-term lease and not having the rent and things changed over time.,187,,
950,0.97,9795.652,9806.863,Point well taken and we'll get you more details that may inform how you consider providing additional guidance to the Department on this.,187,,

952,0.97,9811.835,9844.568,"I also just wanted to echo your point, Councilmember Morales, about the need for more and the ways we should be looking for acquisition dollars to supplement what we have here.",188,,
953,0.97,9847.571,9872.028,"So I think that they go hand in glove, especially the plan Pairing up the housing dollars with the office of economic development office.",188,,
954,0.97,9872.028,9874.364,How that may pair with the conversation may be important.,188,,
955,0.97,9874.364,9886.276,It's not the answer but I think it's an important component we should think about together.,188,,
956,0.97,9886.276,9904.561,Nothing to add to the 5: acquisition of public property.,189,,
957,0.97,9904.561,9920.81,"And we have tried to be sure there weren't barriers, that we have reduced the barriers paired with those housing dollars.",190,,
958,0.97,9920.81,9953.009,"I would also add that I think there was an announcement today of the $30 million that the Council included in the 2021 adopted budget for the strategic investment fund, which could be paired with dollars in Arpa and housing dollars, really looking at opportunities for community spaces.",191,,
959,0.97,9953.009,9953.31,Right.,192,,
960,0.97,9953.31,9968.558,And also recognizing that the Edi got the additional allocation to do additional acquisitions similar to something housing got.,193,,
961,0.97,9968.558,9981.037,There are acquisition funds and they are in a couple different pots.,193,,
962,0.97,9981.037,9981.671,Great.,194,,
963,0.97,9981.671,9994.918,Another area I think there's a lot of interest among Councilmembers will be important as we talk about what's possible with these funds.,194,,
964,0.97,9994.918,9997.854,I appreciate what you have been elevating.,194,,
965,0.97,9997.854,10000.99,"Okay, I don't see any more hands.",194,,
966,0.97,10000.99,10007.397,"The last two items together, which are less dense and equally important.",194,,
967,0.97,10007.397,10013.803,"I will turn it back over to the two of you, then we'll take additional questions.",194,,
968,0.97,10013.803,10014.07,Great.,195,,

981,0.97,10166.789,10205.395,This is a historic investment for the city and we want to make sure that we're making a difference with these dollars and we could measure that difference.,195,,
982,0.97,10205.395,10211.367,"There's a lot that we want to leverage, so that's where that's coming in.",195,,
983,0.97,10211.367,10220.543,And develop a report on pilot program strategies for broader applications across city programs.,195,,
984,0.97,10220.543,10228.017,I'm going to roll into the next category.,195,,

992,0.97,10300.39,10300.69,Great.,196,,
993,0.97,10300.69,10308.765,Can you do the Wrapup slide and then we can take questions.,196,,
994,0.97,10308.765,10334.223,I wanted to take two minutes because there were questions we identified earlier going through the process to consider as the committee proposes the plan.,197,,
995,0.97,10334.223,10338.594,This reflects many questions that were asked today.,197,,
996,0.97,10338.594,10345.702,There's more discussion in the memo for the committee's consideration.,197,,
997,0.97,10345.702,10348.771,Thank you so much.,198,,

1001,0.97,10355.144,10370.326,"Just the point I would like to make here, the first relates to the transportation investment or the stay healthy making permanent some of the stay healthy streets.",199,,
1002,0.97,10370.326,10391.748,"I want to lift up up that, as we heard in public comments, there's a lot of interest in experimenting with ways to make permanent some of the keep it moving streets, and hope that we could discuss funding for that purpose as well.",199,,
1003,0.97,10391.748,10421.31,"Then Secondly, as it realities to the parks and Rec funding, I understand that some of the $1.25 million for enhanced maintenance that they will use some of that to contract with the King County sheriff's office during the summer.",199,,
1004,0.97,10421.31,10430.253,Is this a new arrangement or existing relationship?,199,,
1005,0.97,10430.253,10430.553,Thank you.,199,,
1006,0.97,10430.553,10443.399,I believe they contracted last summer as well when they were having challenges to the beaches being closed.,200,,
1007,0.97,10443.399,10444.634,That's my understanding.,200,,
1008,0.97,10444.634,10449.272,"If you could check that, that's not my recollection.",201,,
1009,0.97,10449.272,10451.874,Just love to double check that.,201,,
1010,0.97,10451.874,10453.109,Happy to.,202,,
1011,0.97,10453.109,10453.876,Thanks.,203,,
1012,0.97,10453.876,10455.778,Thank you so much.,204,,
1013,0.97,10455.778,10492.348,"I also will flag that I'm interested in additional information for the communications that we have been receiving and part of the public testimony today about the full extension of the safe streets and wanting to either expand our safe Street program completely, or if there's concern about one or two areas, be sure we have the funding included that I know folks wanted to do.",204,,
1014,0.97,10492.348,10525.047,I know how busy the space is and how much it's been appreciated so let's try and see if we can expand so all those miles are covered.,204,,
1015,0.97,10525.047,10531.787,Thank you.,205,,
1016,0.97,10531.787,10537.493,My understanding is the proposal doesn't include the fair moving streets.,205,,
1017,0.97,10537.493,10549.005,I think it would take $2 million or $3 million to do the permanent investments and there could be a mismatch in eligibility for these funds.,205,,
1018,0.97,10549.005,10566.622,It would be probably at least doubling the size of the investment in that area to make those investments.,205,,
1019,0.97,10566.622,10566.889,Great.,206,,
1020,0.97,10566.889,10578.834,We'll get additional clarity then on the difference between the two types of safe streets we offer and eligibility with Arpa.,206,,
1021,0.97,10578.834,10605.494,"There are so many pressing needs, so if it's not in there, just signal interest be sure we address that in 2021.",206,,
1022,0.97,10605.494,10620.643,"Federal dollars are coming down and we'll have the opportunity for supplemental discussion in July as well, then in September talking about the fall budget as well.",206,,
1023,0.97,10620.643,10624.08,Anything else you would like to add?,206,,
1024,0.97,10624.08,10626.749,I think you covered it all.,207,,
1025,0.97,10626.749,10637.526,I would restate the deadline request for amendment proposals is noon on Tuesday.,207,,
1026,0.97,10637.526,10652.908,We are asking those to be Self- balanced so I'll have to understand what you want to decrease or eliminate.,207,,
1027,0.97,10652.908,10656.178,Thank you again today.,208,,
1028,0.97,10656.178,10674.397,"Everyone from central staff, thank you so much for all the work that you have of done as well and your team.",208,,
1029,0.97,10674.397,10678.968,I want to thank Council President Gonzalez.,208,,
1030,0.97,10678.968,10703.059,I know this will be getting us set for a more robust discussion and additional direction on how to allocate those dollars.,208,,
1031,0.97,10703.059,10722.678,"Councilmember Lewis, thank you for talking about your proposal on Monday and we look forward to seeing how that continues to pair with these types of investments to create a more equitable community.",208,,
1032,0.97,10722.678,10733.122,Do let us know what your thoughts are.,208,,
1033,0.97,10733.122,10751.006,We look forward to hearing your feedback and appreciated your ongoing feedback in anticipation of the introduction of the bill.,208,,
1034,0.97,10751.006,10766.422,We will continue to build on these critical priorities to create that more equitable economy Postcovid.,208,,
1035,0.97,10766.422,10768.057,Just on time now.,208,,
1036,0.97,10972.728,10984.239,I'm Karina with Council central staff and I've prepared a presentation that provides an overview of this substitute bill.,209,,
1037,0.97,10984.239,11008.731,"As a reminder, the substance abused legislation that was discussed at the last housing and Finance Committee on May 18th included a bill that would require entities to provide Precontract disclosures, timely payment and payment disclosures for services valued at $600 or more.",209,,
1038,0.97,11008.731,11027.383,It would be effective March 1ST of next year and implemented by there would be a revision to.,209,,
1039,0.97,11027.383,11041.563,Independent contractor coverage where the law would state there would not be coverage of contractors where the only relationship is a property rental agreement.,209,,
1040,0.97,11041.563,11056.278,An example of this kind of arrangement would be like if a hair stylist had a relationship with the salon where the only relationship was renting a booth for work space.,209,,
1041,0.97,11056.278,11064.42,Another kind of example could be a shared work space that any contractor could rent space from.,209,,
1042,0.97,11064.42,11075.564,"If that's all that's happening, those independent contractors would not be covered by the nature of not being hired.",209,,
1043,0.97,11075.564,11086.175,"Just to make it clear, this is carving them out specifically.",209,,
1044,0.97,11086.175,11089.912,The office can address specific rules with the administration.,209,,
1045,0.97,11089.912,11109.698,"Next the value of services, the amount of compensation that's either proposed or expected, and would be adjusted to reflect the amount of money required for Nonemployee compensation.",209,,
1046,0.97,11109.698,11134.056,Right now that 1099 form requires businesses to report all Nonemployee compensation of $600 or more.,209,,
1047,0.97,11134.056,11159.915,The Office of labor standards would file a schedule with the city clerk and do their part in communicating adjustments to the public.,209,,
1048,0.97,11159.915,11166.688,"Next, this covers workers in platform gig work.",209,,
1049,0.97,11166.688,11175.831,"I think if you could explain, I want to say a couple words about this one.",210,,
1050,0.97,11175.831,11176.598,Okay.,211,,
1051,0.97,11176.598,11180.669,Platform workers would still be covered.,211,,
1052,0.97,11180.669,11207.496,"However, the specific provisions that would only apply to platform gig work would be removed and the office of labor standards could handle things relating to those requirements.",211,,
1053,0.97,11207.496,11216.605,The requirement for a tip or service charge would be removed.,211,,
1054,0.97,11216.605,11225.547,"Those are situations where a customer may say what they plan to tip the worker, and that should be included in the Online plan.",211,,
1055,0.97,11225.547,11240.896,That could be removed and noted in other ways.,211,,
1056,0.97,11240.896,11255.41,"Also the requirement to provide disclosure after completion of each line and requirements to provide disclosures and notice of rights in an electronic App, specifically a phone App or Online portal.",211,,
1057,0.97,11255.41,11265.187,That is the overview of the changes.,211,,
1058,0.97,11265.187,11266.188,Councilmember Herbold?,211,,
1059,0.97,11266.188,11287.309,"Well, I was asked by Councilmember Strauss who couldn't be here today, this was his contribution to the substitute.",212,,
1060,0.97,11287.309,11314.036,"There is broad support for this amendment, Gwinn that we intend to address many of these in a subsequent conversation Councilmembers Strauss and lieu are also going to be part of that effort moving forward.",212,,
1061,0.97,11314.036,11317.639,Thank you.,212,,
1062,0.97,11317.639,11321.043,Councilmember Lewis?,213,,
1063,0.97,11321.043,11321.276,Yes.,214,,
1064,0.97,11321.276,11321.576,Thank you.,214,,
1065,0.97,11321.576,11323.979,I'll follow up on Councilmember Herbold's comments just now.,214,,
1066,0.97,11323.979,11332.621,I just want to say that I'm really looking forward to digging into the work around the campaign.,214,,
1067,0.97,11377.232,11388.81,"We've heard a lot of complaints last year from a lot of the platforms that hazard pay conversation about, you know, Hollywood and be able to afford it.",215,,
1068,0.97,11388.81,11446.401,"How they were going to have to leave the city all of those folks are still here, those workers are getting paid and those platforms are still profitable so there's a way we can take this work on and all of these additional components around transparency are going to be tackled through that process and I look forward to taking that on increasingly working we are doing every thing we can to extend the economy around minimum wage to extend to these different types of arrangements where these workers have not have the same benefits so I just wanted to echo the comments and say that will definitely be in the scope of work as we take that project on in a bigger way.",215,,
1069,0.97,11446.401,11447.936,Thank you both for Foreshadowing.,216,,
1070,0.97,11447.936,11448.603,More work to come.,216,,
1071,0.97,11448.603,11460.549,Úand I think also identifying sort of the narrow Lane that this will is scoped to address so there can be future conversations.,216,,
1072,0.97,11460.549,11469.624,I'm going to ask that we hold the rest of our comments and questions to the end just to get through the presentation to see the breath of the substitute in front of us so we can ask those questions.,216,,
1073,0.97,11469.624,11470.025,Thank you.,216,,
1074,0.97,11470.025,11480.602,There would be explicit language clarifying the discretion that are vulnerable to violations.,217,,
1075,0.97,11480.602,11496.818,"The ordinance, that kind of discretion is already within the standard practice that they do knowing that there are many violations of all of the labor standards and they need to know how to Prioritize the resources.",217,,
1076,0.97,11496.818,11516.538,"But since this legislation is so vast and covers so many parties, this makes it very clear to the public that they do have that discretion and the other amendment is that the director also has more discretion to develop the new complaint procedure and navigation programs.",217,,
1077,0.97,11516.538,11534.556,There were a number of directors shall do this and do that and it may be changed to recognize that the director is authorized to do those things but not necessarily required.,217,,
1078,0.97,11534.556,11557.312,"Next, the effective date of the labor standards and the introduced legislation is March first of next year and the substitute bill would change the effective date to September one of next year, giving more time for office of labor standards to prepare and more time for the public to prepare as well.",217,,
1079,0.97,11557.312,11610.899,There will be a new Nonqualified section that addresses opposite labor standards funding during the last Finance and housing committee meeting and shared information about office of labor standards Estimations about how much it might cost for them to implement the legislation according to their perspective and that was over $6000 or so this Nonqualified section recognizes there is already a process that is memorialized in the municipal code 3.15 that recognizes a way for Ols specifically to address their funding needs and that is something that is very unique to the office of labor standards.,217,,
1080,0.97,11610.899,11644.666,So this process is already outlined in that law and is basically restated in this section where the office of labor standards director with certified the annual minimum contribution that the director believes is necessary for enforcement and outreach and would include that amount in the letter to the Mayor and Council by September first of this year for next year's budget and then the Mayor would reflect that for the minimum annual budget submitted to the Mayor and Council and that would be a way to recognize Ols estimation of the needs.,217,,
1081,0.97,11644.666,11655.11,"Next, the legislation also referred to in this meeting as the pay up legislation is still in that Nonqualified section.",217,,
1082,0.97,11655.11,11672.727,"The Timeline has also been extended and originally, it was developed for that legislation by late September which would be the budget deliberations and in the substitute bill that Timeline has been extended to the end of 2021.",217,,
1083,0.97,11672.727,11682.103,And that is it for an overview of the substitute bill.,217,,
1084,0.97,11682.103,11692.947,Great I'm not seeing any hands right now I do want to take a second to see if there's any questions or comments on the underlying substitute bill that is in front of us.,218,,
1085,0.97,11692.947,11714.102,I want to think Karina for her really intense work to research with Councilmembers and to try to incorporate feedback that we've heard from various Stakeholders and also to work to address some of the items and desires that we had heard from the office of labor standards.,218,,
1086,0.97,11714.102,11762.617,"I want to thank the director for their work along with the office of labor standards staff for helping to identify strategies to come as you saw in item number four here, to really make sure for the Prioritization and investigation were we know that there's the violations so I think this is very helpful languages at the Councilmember that is Walter has written into the legislation I appreciate that and we also want to reiterate for folks who may be just tuning in now, this is not a bill that changes anybody independent contractor status this is really about the ones that they noted at the beginning trying to make sure that there is additional transparency for all parties and this is not a change in independent contractor status.",218,,
1087,0.97,11762.617,11791.646,We know that there independent contractors that have called and with potential concerns and want to make sure that folks know this is not changing anybody's status currently but truly transparency vehicle for making sure that all parties have access to the same information so with that I want to see if there was any additional comments or questions or anything else before we consider the amendment that you have.,218,,
1088,0.97,11791.646,11792.113,No.,219,,
1089,0.97,11792.113,11792.947,Not seen any.,220,,
1090,0.97,11792.947,11793.248,Wonderful.,220,,
1091,0.97,11793.248,11799.42,"Karina, anything else you would like to add on this?",220,,
1092,0.97,11799.42,11800.922,"I think that is all, thanks.",221,,
1093,0.97,11800.922,11824.779,"Should give the Walk-Through of that and making it really easy to understand the seven points and the document in front of us and I believe that you heard folks calling in and their appreciation addressed in that . So, with that, Councilman, do you have amendment number one, do you want to move it to put it in front of us?",222,,
1094,0.97,11824.779,11825.18,Indeed.,223,,
1095,0.97,11825.18,11826.681,Adopting amendment one by listing the agenda.,223,,
1096,0.97,11826.681,11827.782,I will second that.,224,,
1097,0.97,11827.782,11830.585,It is moved and Seconded and would you like to describe it?,224,,
1098,0.97,11830.585,11831.019,Absolutely.,225,,
1099,0.97,11831.019,11842.864,So this amendment was developed in collaboration with the office of labor standards and also to address some of the issues that we heard in public testimony today.,225,,
1100,0.97,11842.864,11863.117,"The amendment itself ensures Úthat the office of labor standards director is empowered to issue rules exempting certain classes of independent contractors and clarifying that the rules, the directors Rulemaking is discretionary.",225,,
1101,0.97,11863.117,11904.225,"We provide some criteria for how we expect the director to use that but we have heard from certain categories of professional independent contractors who are making the argument that there isn't a problem within their industry, but, I think it is most appropriate for the office of labor standards to sort of make the determination of whether or not there should be specific exceptions.",225,,
1102,0.97,11904.225,11906.527,Thank you.,225,,
1103,0.97,11906.527,11910.832,"Karina, do you have anything else that you would like to add to the summary of amendment number one?",226,,
1104,0.97,11910.832,11916.638,You are all on you as well.,226,,
1105,0.97,11916.638,11918.339,"So, the amendment would do three things.",227,,
1106,0.97,11918.339,11958.413,"It would do exactly what Councilmember Herbert has just described and just to give more information about the criteria that the director will use when considering exemptions, the director will be required to consider whether any class of exempted contractors has the bargaining power in their relationship and also would not be allowed to exclude independent contractors who are prone to the proficiency, are unlikely to volunteer information about possible violations and up the criteria that the director would develop.",227,,
1107,0.97,11958.413,11988.076,"Also, this amendment would keep the exemption for attorneys, but would also remove the exemption for licensed medical professionals as for the research uncovered that a number of licensed medical professionals are also misclassified themselves, which happened often when I conducted more research into hiring situations of many different classes of independent contractors.",227,,
1108,0.97,11988.076,11999.821,"So, that Exemptio would be removed the legislation it could be further contemplated by the Ols director but the legislation would begin from the standpoint that those classes of independent contractors are not included.",227,,
1109,0.97,11999.821,12014.469,"And last the legislation would further make clear that the director has the authority to issue those rules, they would have the effect of law, but any role would be discretionary so rules are not required, they are discretionary.",227,,
1110,0.97,12014.469,12023.444,And that is it.,227,,
1111,0.97,12023.444,12025.38,"Councilmember, not seeing any additional questions on this.",228,,
1112,0.97,12025.38,12031.819,Anything that you would like to say and closing comments before we consider amendment number one?,228,,
1113,0.97,12031.819,12034.589,Okay thank you so much.,228,,
1114,0.97,12034.589,12071.926,Amendment number one is in front of us that business has been moved and Seconded thank you again for your support to work with the also office of labor standards and other Stakeholders and identifying ways to address the issues that you raised in Discriminant describing the amendment this is a carefully Crafted amendment and I think that will also give us a greater insight into the areas where we do have a lot of concern which is what this bill is intended to address so with that Madam clerk you please call the roll on amendment number one?,228,,
1115,0.97,12072.36,12105.259,[role being called].,229,,
1116,0.97,12105.259,12119.04,I will say a couple of quick words.,230,,
1117,0.97,12119.04,12147.702,I really want to think everybody who's been involved in crafting this legislation . I got a long and strong interest in addressing some of the problems that we are seeing around misclassified workers and I think this is a really good way to begin to empower people who are classified as independent contractors.,230,,
1118,0.97,12147.702,12186.874,"Doesn't mean that they are all classified but by empowering the independent contract all of them with information about the expectations, within Precontract disclosures and After-the-fact with payment, that is really taking sort of a first step in empowering this workforce to be able to start identifying for themselves whether or not they are being properly classified as a contract worker or misclassified.",230,,
1119,0.97,12186.874,12218.072,And this legislation will not address that for those workers who feel that they come after getting this information that they are misclassified but it will help make that group of people stronger as we look at this issue further with campaigns like the pay up campaign and so this is really about allowing people to have knowledge of their rights and expectations and empowering them to ask for them.,230,,
1120,0.97,12218.072,12224.745,And again it is a long time coming.,230,,
1121,0.97,12224.745,12226.18,The recommendations were made back in 2019.,230,,
1122,0.97,12226.18,12280.735,"I really appreciate the indulgence of the chair and letting me bring this forward in her Committee, looking forward to Partnering with the Councilmember Lewis and Strauss on the minimum compensation conversation with working Washington, really appreciate that the gig platform representatives are now admitted to be at the table we have our first meeting on that effort next week and also very appreciative, not only of Ols and helping get us started, and allow Ols in providing some of the refinement on the legislation but really want to think them on the staff for all of the hardware that she has been doing on this bill and shepherding it through.",230,,
