131,0.97,866.765,870.169,Local means we include--too.,24,,
132,0.97,870.169,874.473,You know what this means by definition.,24,,

134,0.97,880.446,884.149,Nothing is happened for many years.,24,,
135,0.97,884.149,884.583,Hundred times.,24,,
136,0.97,884.583,886.819,Right now ice pick everybody who will listen to me.,24,,
137,0.97,886.819,893.125,"Is this another 50,000 left in the state or in Seattle?",24,,

145,0.97,923.923,927.126,But the comments that you just gave were borderline on topic.,26,,
146,0.97,927.126,930.596,So right now we are done though.,26,,
147,0.97,930.596,933.866,I am going to call the next Speaker.,26,,

149,0.97,936.101,945.377,Steve Rostello is next and I see you want to talk about trees but that is not on the agenda.,27,,
150,0.97,945.377,948.113,Is there something on the agenda you would like to discuss.,27,,
151,0.97,948.113,954.62,That is part of the problem then.,28,,
152,0.97,954.62,958.457,You're not as good as Republicans at stifling speech but you're working on it quite frankly.,28,,
153,0.97,958.457,961.994,The whole Privity of this committee should be what is available.,28,,
154,0.97,961.994,965.264,This is what you people are supposed to be the intake.,28,,
155,0.97,965.264,970.703,You are supposed to be the ones that are looking out for that section for the city council.,28,,
156,0.97,970.703,981.38,"You know, trees is an old subject and quite frankly there are a lot of things that have been, I guess, much more important.",28,,
157,0.97,981.38,998.998,"Many people believe that the talk that I have heard from the city Department seem to be that the idea is to make the tree ordinance to continue to make trees large and valuable, easy to get rid of.",28,,
158,0.97,998.998,1005.17,The purpose of the tree ordinance that most people in the city have been looking for is an ordinance that actually protects trees of value.,28,,
159,0.97,1005.17,1019.985,"Because, you know, as a good Environmentalist, the large trees are the ones that actually take the carbon out of the air, that actually take the Pollutants out of the air, that do good things.",28,,
160,0.97,1019.985,1020.986,Shrubs do not do much.,28,,
161,0.97,1020.986,1025.924,"This is been going on now for quite a few years, and even before you were chairman of the committee.",28,,
162,0.97,1025.924,1028.127,"Steve, which item are you addressing?",29,,
163,0.97,1028.127,1036.168,Public comment which appears to be something that you really don't want to hear.,30,,
164,0.97,1036.168,1048.113,The Council does not want to count the houses and the housing that we are losing that is not expensive because it is private.,30,,
165,0.97,1048.113,1052.451,This is--it almost looks like T-Ball where we don't keep score.,30,,
166,0.97,1052.451,1066.331,"Land-Use is something that you have not created the housing problems, you have not done anything to get rid of them.",30,,
167,0.97,1066.331,1067.199,"Thank you, Steve.",31,,

173,0.97,1079.445,1080.846,I appreciate you.,33,,
174,0.97,1080.846,1089.655,"Seeing as we have no additional speakers, the public comment period is closed and we will move on to the next agenda item, items of business.",33,,
175,0.97,1089.655,1100.065,"Item 1, Council members, and the first agenda item defines some housing element is minor and major institution master plans.",33,,
176,0.97,1100.065,1105.804,Will you please read the brief that it title into the record.,33,,
177,0.97,1105.804,1115.881,,34,,
178,0.97,1118.517,1122.02,[ordinance read] a look,35,,
179,0.97,1122.02,1123.222,"That is excellent, thank you.",36,,
180,0.97,1123.222,1131.997,We are join but Gordon Clowers and the Council central staff.,36,,
181,0.97,1131.997,1133.866,Will you brief the Committee on this legislation.,36,,
182,0.97,1133.866,1138.504,I see Gordon with us now.,36,,
183,0.97,1138.504,1145.744,I will do a short presentation and then I will make a couple of comments.,37,,
184,0.97,1145.744,1149.982,All right.,38,,
185,0.97,1149.982,1158.223,[inaudible],39,,
186,0.97,1162.194,1162.528,Okay.,40,,
187,0.97,1162.528,1164.329,I am assuming you can see that.,40,,
188,0.97,1164.329,1169.601,"Yes, sir, we can.",41,,
189,0.97,1169.601,1170.035,Okay.,42,,
190,0.97,1170.035,1173.105,Thank you for the opportunity to talk today about this proposal.,42,,
191,0.97,1173.105,1187.686,And the subject is we are waiting on in minutes to chapter 23 of the land use code.,42,,
192,0.97,1187.686,1191.757,I am just going to see if the slides will move.,42,,
193,0.97,1191.757,1193.192,There we go.,42,,
194,0.97,1193.192,1199.932,Okay.,42,,
195,0.97,1199.932,1212.878,The overall purpose of the amendments are to amend Land- use code to provide more flexibility in the institution Land-Use code to accommodate housing at colleges and urban centers.,42,,
196,0.97,1212.878,1220.319,"Just a little bit of background, background concepts before we get into the proposal itself.",42,,
197,0.97,1220.319,1235.534,The urban centers are of course conference a plan designations for where the city most prefers the greatest amount of growth to occur in the city for the long-term.,42,,
198,0.97,1235.534,1242.274,"Capitol Hill, first Hill is an urban center.",42,,
199,0.97,1242.274,1258.857,"The Land-Use codes, major institution regulations, the city's overall Tandem Express Inthe code is for the major institutions to be able to grow and add to their facilities overtime to support their missions.",42,,
200,0.97,1258.857,1265.364,While at the same time maintaining compatibility with the neighborhood.,42,,
201,0.97,1265.364,1277.843,"The major institutions include larger hospitals, universities, colleges that are located across the city at various locations.",42,,
202,0.97,1277.843,1299.931,"The major institution master plan is the main way that the city influences and has a back and forth with the major institution campuses to define the amount of growth happening, and how it will happen over the long term.",42,,
203,0.97,1299.931,1305.47,We are talking about 15 to 20 year time period.,42,,
204,0.97,1305.47,1323.088,"The major institution master plans are approved by the city council or Mimps, as we called him.",42,,
205,0.97,1323.088,1338.07,"One major element of the city code is that it allows for a range of changes to occur, to existing Mimps and defined as either major or minor, or an exempt category as well.",43,,
206,0.97,1338.07,1349.581,"So there are various things that can be, you know, be desirable to change or approve a change to a plan over the life span of the plan.",43,,
207,0.97,1349.581,1359.624,Some of those are just allowing a little more space at an approved building or allowing an extra space to be rented off campus.,43,,
208,0.97,1359.624,1364.129,Or minor departures from regulations that apply.,43,,
209,0.97,1364.129,1382.28,"And then major amendments are more like adding more space to the campus itself, changing any zoning or development standard that is in the campus land or zoned area.",43,,
210,0.97,1382.28,1387.385,And other larger kinds of changes.,43,,
211,0.97,1387.385,1401.099,So we have an interest in providing a little bit more flexibility in the regime as it is written right now to accommodate adjustments in the minor amendment category.,43,,
212,0.97,1401.099,1417.849,"This would be to allow housing development that has not been included in the affected major institution, Seattle central college.",43,,
213,0.97,1417.849,1421.787,Not been anticipated back when the plan was developed 15 years ago or more.,43,,
214,0.97,1421.787,1434.065,"So under today's code accommodating a development, housing development to occur sooner do not be accomplished without a major amendment to the master plan.",43,,
215,0.97,1434.065,1441.039,So the intent here is to allow minor amendment process to be used to update the master plan.,43,,
216,0.97,1441.039,1454.953,"And we are narrowing it to be applicable to colleges and urban centers, and that is just sort of Tailoring it to be used where it is most appropriate.",43,,
217,0.97,1454.953,1467.866,"Further, that the proposal is narrowed to allow just one development with residential uses to occur within the master plan's lifetime.",43,,
218,0.97,1467.866,1472.938,So that sort of summarizes the Tailoring that we hope that this will accomplish with this amendment.,43,,
219,0.97,1472.938,1477.242,Here is a map of Seattle central college.,44,,
220,0.97,1477.242,1490.722,"They do have a site of interest to accommodate housing and a new development . that is the existing parking garage, building on pine Street between Harvard and Royalston.",44,,
221,0.97,1490.722,1501.733,There is currently two restaurant including a Pizza restaurant on the corners of the pine Street building as it exists today.,44,,
222,0.97,1501.733,1514.012,"The eventual proposal would be to rebuild that building with replacing parking, but also adding residential uses on top of that.",44,,
223,0.97,1514.012,1530.629,Here is a conceptual rendering of the student housing project that could be accommodated if this code amendment is pursued.,44,,
224,0.97,1530.629,1548.346,"So just to summarize, the overall intent of our changes here are to respond to the ongoing interest of the city to promote and encourage housing, to occur sooner than later.",44,,
225,0.97,1548.346,1564.563,Especially urban centers and to aid in the mission of the community college by allowing more students to live closer and on the campus in that Walkable neighborhood.,44,,
226,0.97,1564.563,1588.153,We are looking to provide that measure and amount of flexibility in the code to accomplish this and I just wanted to let you know that the changes maintain the current processes that apply to almost any development or amendment process.,44,,
227,0.97,1588.153,1593.491,The perspective housing development would first need a minor amendment to the existing plan.,44,,
228,0.97,1593.491,1606.171,"That would have to go through the community advisory committee process and subsequently if approved, a building would need to also go through that process as well.",44,,
229,0.97,1606.171,1611.242,"That includes a notice to the community, when those would occur.",44,,
230,0.97,1611.242,1615.313,So that is a short summary.,44,,
231,0.97,1615.313,1621.853,I am happy to answer any other questions about this topic.,44,,
232,0.97,1621.853,1623.288,I will turn it over.,44,,
233,0.97,1623.288,1633.498,"Thank you, Gordon.",45,,
234,0.97,1633.498,1637.402,"I will turn it over to Lish, and then I will ask my colleagues if they have questions.",45,,
235,0.97,1637.402,1650.382,"I will start with the question clarifying something you just said, which is for a building to be built that is still has to go through every standard check approval process that any building being built in Seattle has to go through . is that correct?",45,,
236,0.97,1650.382,1652.617,That is correct.,46,,
237,0.97,1652.617,1662.46,The advisory committee process centrally substitutes in a development review for design review.,46,,
238,0.97,1662.46,1668.633,So that is the Venue in which the project would be reviewed.,46,,
239,0.97,1668.633,1670.502,"Wonderful, thank you, Gordon.",47,,
240,0.97,1670.502,1674.773,"Mr. Whitson, please.",47,,
241,0.97,1674.773,1678.676,There's a minor aspect of this bill.,48,,
242,0.97,1678.676,1689.254,Which Gordon did not mention but I would like to raise because there is a very minor issue that I would recommend amending the bill to address.,48,,
243,0.97,1689.254,1705.17,"The bill, so Congregant residences which includes dormitories and other large facilities when a large number of people live together.",48,,
244,0.97,1705.17,1708.74,Outside of a single-family house.,48,,
245,0.97,1708.74,1714.512,Our permitted or prohibited in various zones.,48,,
246,0.97,1714.512,1732.497,"We have put in an exception for Congregant incidences, owned and operated by colleges and universities to allow them a little more flexibility to locate in various parts of the city.",48,,
247,0.97,1732.497,1756.521,"The bill would expand that to also provide opportunities for Congregant residences affiliated with a college or university . So there needs to be some sort of agreement between the college and university, and the owner or operator of the Congregant residents or most likely a Dorm.",48,,
248,0.97,1756.521,1779.01,"To be located in the same places that other Dorms are located, if they are owned or operated by the college [Indiscernible] this change is made in a number of places in the Land-Use code and made in one place in the major institutions code which might result in a little bit of confusion.",48,,
249,0.97,1779.01,1802.8,"Section 2369-008 of the code is where we define what a major institution use is . It is clear that a major institution use is not necessarily just those uses, owned and operated by colleges and universities, but there are other uses affiliated or associated with colleges and universities.",48,,
250,0.97,1802.8,1818.75,"That may also be defined as major institution uses . There's a set of criteria used to determine whether or not those uses, not owned or operated by a college or university or major institution campus that are considered major institution uses.",48,,
251,0.97,1818.75,1835.533,"The proposal in front of you would amend that section to say owned and operated or affiliated by college or university, and adding that affiliated by mate introduce--it may introduce confusion in applying the rest of the code section.",48,,
252,0.97,1835.533,1840.171,I would recommend deleting those three words from the bill.,48,,
253,0.97,1840.171,1842.006,Wonderful.,49,,
254,0.97,1842.006,1848.012,"Mr. Whitson, are you able to draft an amendment to do so at the next committee?",49,,
255,0.97,1848.012,1850.648,I will be happy to.,50,,
256,0.97,1850.648,1852.016,"Wonderful, thank you.",51,,
257,0.97,1852.016,1852.917,"Colleagues, questions.",51,,
258,0.97,1852.917,1853.952,Townsend member Pedersen.,51,,
259,0.97,1853.952,1861.426,Thank you chairman Strauss and for the presentation.,52,,
260,0.97,1861.426,1878.209,Initially I was looking at the title of the bill which talked about community college within the urban center.,52,,
261,0.97,1878.209,1894.826,"But what I'm hearing you say and in looking at the body of the bill itself, you are saying it would apply to other types of universities? I am curious about my district, District 4 which has an urban center and the University of Washington is adjacent to that.",52,,
262,0.97,1894.826,1898.529,I wanted to understand if this would apply to the District and to the University of Washington.,52,,
263,0.97,1898.529,1899.931,That is a good question.,53,,
264,0.97,1899.931,1913.411,"The key portions of the bill that are describing the eligible institutions really narrow it down to technical colleges, which is what we usually referred to as community colleges.",53,,
265,0.97,1913.411,1914.913,Okay.,54,,
266,0.97,1914.913,1917.682,That is helpful to know.,54,,
267,0.97,1917.682,1925.256,"Thanks, Lish, for clarifying that you will bring forward an amendment.",54,,
268,0.97,1925.256,1933.965,"I heard you say the three words that you are going to remove our ""or affiliated with"". is that correct?",54,,
269,0.97,1933.965,1940.538,"Yes, that is correct in just section 4 of the bill",55,,
270,0.97,1940.538,1942.006,"Section 4, thank you.",56,,
271,0.97,1942.006,1947.045,Appreciate the chair having--are we going to be voting on this today?,57,,
272,0.97,1947.045,1948.112,No.,58,,
273,0.97,1948.112,1950.748,That would be at our next meeting,58,,
274,0.97,1950.748,1951.349,Okay.,59,,
275,0.97,1951.349,1974.739,"One thought I have is that I know we have received some concerns about--even though it is appropriately narrowed in the case, it would not serve or automatically serve as a precedent for other types of major institution so might bring forward an amendment just to the recitals, just to note that this is not meant to be an automatic precedent.",59,,
276,0.97,1974.739,1975.34,"Okay, thank you.",59,,
277,0.97,1975.34,1978.142,"Thank you, Councilmember Pedersen.",60,,
278,0.97,1978.142,1985.95,"Colleagues, vice chair? You're good to go?",60,,
279,0.97,1985.95,1986.551,Good to go.,61,,
280,0.97,1986.551,1987.785,"Excellent, thank you.",62,,
281,0.97,1987.785,1995.226,"Let me find my--I would just check . Gordon, thank you for your work on this.",62,,
282,0.97,1995.226,1997.695,"You have anything else to share, Mr. Whitson, before we move on?",62,,
283,0.97,1997.695,1999.097,"No, thank you.",63,,
284,0.97,1999.097,2002.433,Seeing nothing else --,64,,
285,0.97,2002.433,2023.121,"I will add a quick NOTE on the precedent topic, this is certainly not meant to set any kind of residence in the institution master plans when they are developing new plants or expected to plan for the entire range of future development over 15 or 20 years.",65,,
286,0.97,2023.121,2037.001,"That which they expect to occur, and this would not change that, but it would just primarily address the existing plans and ability to be more nimble and accommodate more housing that would not have been expected 15 or 20 years ago.",65,,
287,0.97,2037.001,2042.874,"That was when the master plan was being developed, so I think that is it.",65,,
288,0.97,2042.874,2045.276,That is very helpful.,66,,
289,0.97,2045.276,2051.849,"With that, thank you, Gordon.",66,,
290,0.97,2051.849,2053.684,Thank you for all of your work on this.,66,,
291,0.97,2053.684,2057.588,I can tell you that I think I started working on this when I was a staff member here.,66,,
292,0.97,2057.588,2058.589,It is been that long.,66,,
293,0.97,2058.589,2069.934,"So moving forward in before we opened the remote public hearing, I began ask everyone to please be patient as we continue to learn to operate this real system in real time.",66,,
294,0.97,2069.934,2076.874,We have growing pains and we are continuing to look at ways to Fine-Tune and add new features to allow for additional means of public space on our Council meetings.,66,,
295,0.97,2076.874,2078.576,I see no one remotely present.,66,,
296,0.97,2078.576,2092.223,"Eric, can you confirm that there are no public comment rest earrings registering remotely and is that correct?",66,,
297,0.97,2092.223,2095.059,That is correct.,67,,
298,0.97,2095.059,2101.265,Could you check the public sign in sheet? There's no other sheet so that is that.,68,,
299,0.97,2101.265,2105.269,"Mr. Tsimerman, you signed up for the public hearing?",68,,
300,0.97,2105.269,2108.539,Yes.,69,,
301,0.97,2108.539,2115.413,[Indiscernible] [microphone inaccessible],69,,
302,0.97,2115.413,2125.289,That is correct and we have to stay on topic on the bill before us nothing else.,70,,
303,0.97,2125.289,2128.993,I am giving you a preemptive warning because the last one was a little on the fence.,70,,
304,0.97,2128.993,2131.095,"I will stay and talk, no problem.",71,,
305,0.97,2131.095,2137.401,[Indiscernible] I won't speak about agenda number one.,71,,
306,0.97,2137.401,2142.707,I see what here looks like used in zoning.,71,,
307,0.97,2142.707,2145.776,You are doing very good job.,71,,
308,0.97,2145.776,2152.55,"This is pending, the University [Indiscernible] students need the room.",71,,
309,0.97,2152.55,2161.993,"The problem as I see this right now, for many years everybody thinks that's what is this, land use in zoning.",71,,
310,0.97,2161.993,2162.793,Very interesting to me.,71,,
311,0.97,2162.793,2180.978,"I look and I say what is the U.S.? for many years when Council go, another Council come, another goes through and another comes.",71,,

316,0.97,2184.448,2189.153,"Guys, you do a good job for 20 years.",71,,
317,0.97,2189.153,2190.988,We are totally in a new year right now.,71,,
318,0.97,2190.988,2203.868,"Can you Explainto me what is this, people [Indiscernible] very good job but they go down and down, and down.",71,,
319,0.97,2203.868,2213.711,How is this possible I am generally confused about the U.S. I am of businessman.,71,,

326,0.97,2230.895,2232.597,This is exactly what is happening.,71,,

336,0.97,2324.488,2331.462,"Like I said, it must relate to this bill.",74,,
337,0.97,2331.462,2336.167,Actually one free shot is probably enough for meeting and I think if you allow me to I will speak to this one.,74,,
338,0.97,2336.167,2345.776,"It is tough following Alex, and then your long statement was like reading a use agreement on a computer.",74,,
339,0.97,2345.776,2348.079,But there are two different processes of trying to do things.,74,,

603,0.97,4004.867,4006.302,We are the key ones.,140,,
604,0.97,4006.302,4008.003,I will share my screen.,140,,
605,0.97,4008.003,4012.074,Hopefully.,140,,
606,0.97,4024.887,4025.254,All right.,140,,
607,0.97,4025.254,4032.128,We are set.,140,,
608,0.97,4032.128,4045.341,"As know what said, we are here to talk about two different grants that we are--the first one is a grant for a stationary of planning in the North end of Seattle.",140,,
609,0.97,4045.341,4053.349,"There are three new transit stations, two light rail stations opening in 2024-2025.",140,,
610,0.97,4053.349,4063.292,Also very close by the air is the PRT station opening at 1/45 and 15th Avenue in 2026.,140,,
611,0.97,4063.292,4069.799,Our stationary plan includes all of these three areas.,140,,
612,0.97,4069.799,4089.318,"We have done a lot of work today and we actually got started in 2019 and went through several phases with the community to develop a vision plan, kind of a plan for what the community would like to see in these areas and we are now poised to take the next step and begin some implementation.",140,,
613,0.97,4089.318,4102.131,"That would be zoning study, environmental analysis, and then eventually bringing forward some legislation for the new Sony around these stations.",140,,
614,0.97,4102.131,4106.001,That is to make the most of those capital investments.,140,,
615,0.97,4106.001,4129.058,"The legislature in 2021 appropriated $2.5 million for cities to facilitate transit oriented development . So we were able to take advantage of this new program and the city of Seattle was awarded $250,000, again to support our environmental studies for this station area.",140,,
616,0.97,4129.058,4141.103,So these funds will help us hire consulting services to perform the full EIS because this is kind of a Transformational change that will happen in this area.,140,,
617,0.97,4141.103,4151.18,Where also the alignment of this with our coverage the plan update.,140,,
618,0.97,4151.18,4155.284,Because we feel there are many--there are several key citywide Land-Use policies that can also affect this area.,140,,
619,0.97,4155.284,4173.102,"We want to make sure that those things are in tandem and that we are not coming in with a Rezoning proposal, and then a year later we have a comprehensive plan amendment that would change all of the proposals that we have made without benefit of those conferences plan amendments.",140,,
620,0.97,4173.102,4176.205,So we very much want to do this together in a coordinated fashion.,140,,
621,0.97,4176.205,4183.546,So that is our plan.,140,,
622,0.97,4183.546,4188.684,"I will turn it over to Maggie now I will tell you a little bit about her grant, and then we can pause for questions.",140,,
623,0.97,4188.684,4202.598,So the grant I will be talking about today is from the Department of Ecology for the shoreline master program competitive grant that Ecology offered at the end of last year.,141,,
624,0.97,4202.598,4214.109,"This grant is to support shoreline planning and planning related efforts to advance a local shoreline planning priorities, and to improve the implementation of the shoreline master program.",141,,
625,0.97,4214.109,4229.325,"Sdci was awarded $50,730 to complete the final modeling for the habitat evaluation procedures program that is part of our shoreline master program mitigation planning.",141,,
626,0.97,4229.325,4232.895,"Next slide, please.",141,,
627,0.97,4232.895,4246.408,"So as many of you know, or is all of you know, Sdci is responsible for implementing chapter 2368 of the Seattle municipal code known as the shoreline master program.",141,,
628,0.97,4246.408,4270.666,"So one section in our program is 2368, 127, that provides for the development of the mitigation program that improves the implementation of the Smp by establishing a permanent tool to measure ecological impacts and to mitigate--and the mitigation for these impacts.",141,,
629,0.97,4270.666,4300.529,"So the habitat evaluation procedures program is the tool that Sdci is developing to implement this section and the Department of Ecology grant will provide the funds for Sdci to complete the modeling portion of this work . So we have been working on this program for several years now and we just have one last portion to finish up the modeling work, and then we can move on for approval of the program.",141,,
630,0.97,4300.529,4308.971,"Next slide is for questions, if anybody has questions for us.",141,,
631,0.97,4308.971,4311.04,"Thank you, Maggie and Patrice.",142,,
632,0.97,4311.04,4315.978,It looks all very straightforward to me.,142,,
633,0.97,4315.978,4316.545,"Colleagues, any questions?",142,,
634,0.97,4316.545,4318.647,I have just a question about the tool.,143,,
635,0.97,4318.647,4330.759,"Maggie, you and I go way back and we work together, but I don't know if it was the last update to the shoreline master plan.",143,,
636,0.97,4330.759,4331.76,That was a long process.,143,,
637,0.97,4331.76,4337.933,Is this tool going to facilitate and will it help going forward for Council to make decisions on updates?,143,,
638,0.97,4337.933,4343.639,"Because this mitigation will be able to be modeled faster and easier, et cetera.",143,,
639,0.97,4343.639,4355.851,"Councilmember Nelson, this is just a portion of the whole package of the shoreline master program.",144,,
640,0.97,4355.851,4367.329,So the tool is intended to help in the project so it is that the project stage and not the program development stage.,144,,
641,0.97,4367.329,4375.27,But it is an important tool for the implementation of our shoreline master program.,144,,
642,0.97,4375.27,4379.975,I am sorry to get into the weeds because we are not even talking about the tool but talking about the grant.,145,,
643,0.97,4379.975,4380.576,You are fine.,145,,
644,0.97,4380.576,4384.012,"I appreciate you, Councilmember Nelson.",146,,
645,0.97,4384.012,4386.448,You will quickly see that we get into the center quickly here.,146,,
646,0.97,4386.448,4387.149,It is always welcome.,146,,
647,0.97,4387.149,4398.127,"Maggie and Patrice, this looks very straightforward.",146,,
648,0.97,4398.127,4400.429,"Maggie, I see you have something else so please take it away.",146,,
649,0.97,4400.429,4407.302,I was going to say as part of the implementation of the tool we will bring it back to Council to review and approve as part of the shoreline master program.,147,,
650,0.97,4407.302,4407.636,Wonderful.,148,,
651,0.97,4407.636,4420.082,Councilmember Nelson noted it is not about the Deepness of the policy area but simply accepting a grant to date typically . typically in my committee I have a rule that is not a required rule.,148,,
652,0.97,4420.082,4431.393,It is a rule that things are heard twice before we passed them out because these funds do not require public hearing and because I like to get these funds dispersed as quickly as possible.,148,,
653,0.97,4431.393,4435.731,"Colleagues, unless there is an objection I would like to vote them out today.",148,,
654,0.97,4435.731,4439.168,I see thumbs up and heads nodding yes.,148,,
655,0.97,4439.168,4449.578,"Any further discussion before we moved to a vote? seeing nine, Maggie and Patrice, you did a darn good job and I moved to recommend adoption.",148,,
656,0.97,4449.578,4453.682,Is there a second?,148,,

668,0.97,4506.335,4511.34,That is with Sdci and Council central staff.,153,,
669,0.97,4511.34,4515.177,I see we have a number of people hanging on from the appointment section.,153,,
670,0.97,4515.177,4518.247,Feel free to drop off at any time.,153,,
671,0.97,4518.247,4525.854,"If you would like to continue to follow the meeting, please do so via the Channel or see the list of options listed on the agenda today.",153,,
672,0.97,4525.854,4531.393,"Take it away, Gordon.",153,,
673,0.97,4531.393,4543.739,I will say a couple of words about the bill and maybe remind the committee a little bit about what the bill would do and discussed a couple of amendments for the committee consideration today.,154,,
674,0.97,4543.739,4555.517,This is of course the second briefing and discussion by the land use Committee on the Council bill which would modify the regulations for rooftop features.,154,,
675,0.97,4555.517,4563.525,Gordon walked through the presentation at the initial briefing back in late April.,154,,
676,0.97,4563.525,4570.866,"By way of a reminder, rooftop features are defined by the cold, pretty much anything that extends above the roof line.",154,,
677,0.97,4570.866,4592.955,"Think about the height limit of the zone which is actually at the line of the roof and not necessary the top of any features that may extend above the roof or rooftop features are things like mechanical equipment, Railings, Penthouses stairs and overruns, solar collectors, greenhouses and Amenity areas.",154,,
678,0.97,4592.955,4616.044,There are a couple of things driving the changes recommended in the bill and one are modifications to construction codes as the committee will remember last year the committee modified the energy code to include stricter energy requirements to help make the city carbon emission goals where the stricter energy code becomes more for rooftop space for mechanical equipment.,154,,
679,0.97,4616.044,4626.822,There also market conditions driving some of the changes here.,154,,
680,0.97,4626.822,4631.093,Folks like to eat and drink on the rooftop decks and some of that is reflected in some of the changes here.,154,,
681,0.97,4631.093,4642.104,"How does the city regulate rooftop features #3 primary ways and one is percentages limits on rooftop covers, limitations on height of rooftop features and screening and roof edge setback requirements.",155,,
682,0.97,4642.104,4651.947,Those are sort of the three mechanisms him that the city uses to mitigate the appearance of height and scale to go along with having these rooftop features.,155,,
683,0.97,4651.947,4668.196,This would increase the rooftop coverage limits that are various by zones and allow rooftop pictures and make some allowable features more consistent across zones.,155,,
684,0.97,4668.196,4681.076,"Allow Penthouses, lodges, eating and drinking establishments and office usage in the primary zone to have a larger Footprint, and make other clarifying Edits to the code.",155,,
685,0.97,4681.076,4683.745,There are a couple of amendments that are attached to the agenda today.,155,,
686,0.97,4683.745,4686.848,"Unless you have any questions about the bill itself, we can walk through those amendments.",155,,
687,0.97,4686.848,4697.125,"You know, Ketil, let me--I will move through the adoption of the building will walk through the amendments one by one.",156,,
688,0.97,4697.125,4703.165,"If that works for you, colleagues, and seeing agreement I recommend adoption and do I have a second?",156,,
689,0.97,4703.165,4705.901,Second.,157,,
690,0.97,4705.901,4707.402,It is been moved and Seconded.,158,,
691,0.97,4707.402,4714.876,Mr. Freeman summarized amendment one which makes technical corrections and please take it away.,158,,
692,0.97,4714.876,4718.346,Maybe I would just share my screen so that you can all look at it.,159,,
693,0.97,4718.346,4723.051,We are all looking at the same amendment at the same time here.,159,,
694,0.97,4723.051,4726.955,Hopefully I am getting this right.,159,,
695,0.97,4726.955,4727.355,All right.,159,,
696,0.97,4727.355,4730.025,Can you all see that?,159,,
697,0.97,4730.025,4732.127,"Yes, sir, we can.",160,,
698,0.97,4732.127,4738.8,This is amendment one which is large a clarifying amendment.,161,,
699,0.97,4738.8,4747.109,It would acknowledge that there is a new height that did not exist prior to the [Indiscernible] which is a 55 foot limit.,161,,
700,0.97,4747.109,4758.32,We have made accommodations to make it clear that buildings over 40 feet so when that 55 height range can take advantage of certain Dispensations provided by the bill.,161,,
701,0.97,4758.32,4759.154,This is more rooftop coverage.,161,,
702,0.97,4759.154,4764.76,It also makes an edit to the Scribblers error brought to our attention by Gordon.,161,,
703,0.97,4764.76,4772.868,I'm clarifying that there is one section that covers the office space and one Referencing lodging space.,161,,
704,0.97,4772.868,4774.736,Where making that correction on amendment number one.,161,,
705,0.97,4774.736,4777.439,Any questions about amendment number one?,161,,
706,0.97,4777.439,4783.378,I do not because that is because I am the sponsor.,162,,
707,0.97,4783.378,4785.614,"Colleagues, any question to amendment one?",162,,
708,0.97,4785.614,4793.655,I see none so no.,162,,
709,0.97,4793.655,4794.756,These are all very straightforward.,162,,
710,0.97,4794.756,4799.194,Since we do not have any questions or further discussion I will move to amend the Council bill as shown in amendment one.,162,,
711,0.97,4799.194,4800.729,Is there a second?,162,,
712,0.97,4800.729,4802.831,Second a look,163,,
713,0.97,4802.831,4812.073,It is moved and Seconded to amend the Council bill . will the clerk please call the role back roll?,164,,
714,0.97,4812.073,4815.544,[roll call.],165,,
715,0.97,4815.544,4828.823,Is been moved and Seconded to amend Council bill . The motion passes on the Council bill . It has meant amendment.,166,,
716,0.97,4828.823,4832.327,It makes changes related to certain zones in the International district.,166,,
717,0.97,4832.327,4834.93,"Mr. Freeman, can you share an overview of this agreement?",166,,
718,0.97,4834.93,4844.005,Sure . You should be able to see it and hopefully I'm showing that amendment too.,167,,
719,0.97,4844.005,4850.779,The committee will recall this amendment or the basis for the amendment was discussed in public comments when the bill was initially briefed back in April at the public hearing as well.,167,,
720,0.97,4850.779,4863.258,The Originator for this particular amendment is Reverend Thompson who has a tower project planned at the International special review district.,167,,
721,0.97,4863.258,4870.999,It might actually be useful for me to show the downtown zoning map.,167,,
722,0.97,4870.999,4873.702,And perhaps I will do that to help describe with the amendment does.,167,,
723,0.97,4873.702,4876.972,"At the committee knows, in certain parts of the I SRD tower development is more likely.",167,,
724,0.97,4876.972,4882.477,That tower development primarily would occur in part of the Id sometimes referred to as Japan town.,167,,
725,0.97,4882.477,4883.712,That is the area shown up.,167,,
726,0.97,4883.712,4891.052,"Where you see the Idr, international district residential and Idr C. there are some development standards.",167,,
727,0.97,4891.052,4898.026,They dictate the floor plate sizes that are essentially tower floor plate sizes.,167,,
728,0.97,4898.026,4911.239,"Reverend Thompson noted that in other parts of town where towers, of course Skinnier, have a different coverage on development standards.",167,,
729,0.97,4911.239,4949.844,"Those would not apply in Idrc.The Idr or the amendment would allow additional height for elevator overruns in additional rooftop coverage for new buildings in the International district residential and international district residential commercial zones that would only apply to new construction and only applied to develop an over 125 feet in height . at the committee request, Gordon briefed the International special review district board on the Council bill . The potential amendment back in May.",167,,
730,0.97,4949.844,4953.214,Thank you.,168,,
731,0.97,4953.214,4957.452,What was the report from that briefing?,168,,
732,0.97,4957.452,4959.854,"Gordon, did you get a negative or mixed reception?",168,,
733,0.97,4959.854,4961.389,Yes.,169,,
734,0.97,4961.389,4974.069,"There were at least two, and maybe three or four people who commented favorably about the proposed amendment or the concept anyway.",169,,
735,0.97,4974.069,5001.496,"That they recognize that the taller buildings would have slimmer square footage on the rooftops, slimmer form overall, and that they saw purpose for allowing more coverage and also a higher height of the roof items . also potential flexibility on the setback from the roof.",169,,
736,0.97,5001.496,5016.811,Just recognizing that it is different than the standard provisions that are more attuned to the lower buildings in the historic lower scale main heart of Chinatown Id neighborhood.,169,,
737,0.97,5016.811,5024.419,And then there were a couple of other inquiries about sort of rooftop coverage in general and the mechanical equipment.,169,,
738,0.97,5024.419,5038.566,"So the board did not vote on any particular statement, but they--I did not hear any opposition.",169,,
739,0.97,5038.566,5039.367,"Thank you, Gordon.",170,,
740,0.97,5039.367,5043.872,I will admit some skepticism to this amendment when I first heard about it.,170,,
741,0.97,5043.872,5060.221,It was very important for me to recognize the fact that as we allowed for higher heights in zoning through zoning changes that means that you need to have different types of elevators which require different types of mechanical instruments on the top of the building.,170,,
742,0.97,5060.221,5072.033,"It all makes good sense after you read into the weeds, the Wonky details of it all.",170,,
743,0.97,5072.033,5073.701,I will admit where I'm coming from Transparently.,170,,
744,0.97,5073.701,5076.137,"Vice chair, it's in your district and you have anything to share?",170,,
745,0.97,5076.137,5087.749,"I want to thank Gordon and I asked him to brief the I SRD and to make sure we heard back from them that they were aware of what is being proposed and there were no objections raised, so I am good.",171,,
746,0.97,5087.749,5088.183,Thank you.,171,,
747,0.97,5088.183,5088.583,Great.,172,,
748,0.97,5088.583,5090.418,Any further questions or discussion on amendment two?,172,,

755,0.97,5122.584,5127.755,I just thought we had three minutes but just two?,177,,
756,0.97,5127.755,5129.09,Mr. Freeman?,178,,
757,0.97,5129.09,5143.705,You may be thinking about the memo back from April which identified three amendments and essentially two were collapsed into the second amendment in both height and rooftop coverage are addressed by amendment 2 a look,179,,
758,0.97,5143.705,5144.205,Wonderful.,180,,
759,0.97,5144.205,5152.981,I will call out something that you said in your initial presentation with the changes in building code standards.,180,,
760,0.97,5152.981,5160.355,We now require more equipment that previously it was not on the rooftops.,180,,
761,0.97,5160.355,5173.902,It is now on the Rooftops.For that.,180,,
762,0.97,5173.902,5187.015,"With that, are there questions before we vote on the underlining?",180,,
763,0.97,5187.015,5189.184,"Wow, with that, we are just moving.",180,,
764,0.97,5189.184,5196.19,As a mended is there a second?,180,,
