38,0.97,210.543,216.816,"As far as transportation goes, and she knows, instead of her.",11,,
39,0.97,216.816,227.16,"And the police force I'm sorry, the transportation I heard that they were cutting 300,000 trips a day to 75,000.",11,,
40,0.97,227.16,239.172,And we need to be cleaning the infrastructure and increasing public transit given global warming and austerity towards people who use that.,11,,

43,0.97,258.758,266.399,"Oh, Yeah, so I couldn't find your agenda so you need to make it easier to find your transportation agenda.",13,,
44,0.97,266.399,276.109,And I did feel the need because I think Mosqueda deliberately cut me off.,13,,
45,0.97,276.109,287.987,Follow New York city's measures when they're keeping their transportation even more Sparkly clean because of Covid.,13,,
46,0.97,287.987,294.627,I think invest more in public transportation.,13,,
47,0.97,294.627,298.631,And Sawant pointed out the where you are going to cut down the trips.,13,,
48,0.97,298.631,304.237,And keep the work force at Metro Harassment free.,13,,

56,0.97,332.065,338.271,"We obviously fully, fully, fully support the renewal and just had a couple of comments.",15,,
57,0.97,338.271,344.644,"The Coronavirus pandemic has shaken our city and we are in a moment that calls for bold, urgent change.",15,,
58,0.97,344.644,353.386,We cannot come out of the crisis with the same priorities we entered it with.,15,,
59,0.97,353.386,355.088,The renewal is.,15,,
60,0.97,355.088,363.096,Prepared not only to resume our Ridership growth but to base it on transit.,15,,
61,0.97,363.096,367.4,We focus on restoring as much transit service as possible.,15,,
62,0.97,367.4,370.136,We understand the financial constraints faced by the city.,15,,
63,0.97,370.136,373.706,But there's specific steps we can take.,15,,
64,0.97,373.706,380.78,"Raising more revenue with a larger tax, and into transit operations wherever possible.",15,,
65,0.97,380.78,402.535,"We urge the city to choose a .2% increase in sales tax . We are uncomfortable with tax on infrastructure, we must utilize the only tool we have available.",15,,
66,0.97,402.535,407.607,Lower income and communities of colors in a targeted manner.,15,,
67,0.97,407.607,410.042,And restructure the spending plan.,15,,
68,0.97,410.042,416.415,Road maintenance can be funded out of revenue sources.,15,,
69,0.97,416.415,420.82,We support a 4 year measure.,15,,
70,0.97,420.82,425.758,"Even at a .2%, it delivers less service than the original.",15,,
71,0.97,425.758,434.033,It's prudent to shorten the duration of the measure and allow voters to Revisit the issue.,15,,
72,0.97,434.033,435.568,Thank you very much.,15,,
73,0.97,435.568,439.272,"Thank you, Brittany.",16,,
74,0.97,439.272,445.578,"Next, we'll have Alice Lockhart followed by Katie Wilson.",16,,
75,0.97,445.578,447.613,"Good morning, Councilmembers.",17,,
76,0.97,447.613,449.081,I'm Alice Lockhart.,17,,
77,0.97,449.081,454.954,We believe that this is a stopgap to prevent harm to the transit system.,17,,
78,0.97,454.954,457.69,We need progressive revenue.,17,,
79,0.97,457.69,462.829,We support all the amendments except for number 2 which would fund personal trips.,17,,
80,0.97,462.829,472.805,We'd like to see a new amendment that would restrict spending to transit only not road maintenance.,17,,
81,0.97,472.805,481.48,We particularly support the new Morales amendment to tax at a rate more commensurate with the need.,17,,
82,0.97,481.48,484.283,Slightly larger picture but still tightly related.,17,,
83,0.97,484.283,493.693,"We are deeply dismayed by the number of cuts to transit, bikes, in the Mayor's package.",17,,
84,0.97,493.693,507.673,"And if Councilmembers could check your E-mail for a letter from us, adjusting several amendments which would help fix this Prioritization and the mobility needs of this time.",17,,
85,0.97,507.673,519.685,"If we don't fix the rebalancing package, it's going to be hard to suggest that Seattleites tax ourselves in November.",17,,
86,0.97,519.685,525.224,Next Katie Wilson followed by Arthur Bacas.,18,,
87,0.97,525.224,528.661,"Hi, Councilmembers.",19,,
88,0.97,528.661,532.465,Katie speaking for the transit riders Union.,19,,
89,0.97,532.465,535.067,We support shortening this measure to 4 years.,19,,
90,0.97,535.067,543.876,We see this measure as saving our transit system from cuts until as soon as possible.,19,,
91,0.97,543.876,545.344,Funded with Progressive revenue.,19,,
92,0.97,545.344,548.08,And we'll be fighting to make that happen.,19,,
93,0.97,548.08,562.094,We're worried that cuts this fall and next year will be happening at a time when people are trying to return to public transit as the need for social distancing limits the number of riders per coach.,19,,
94,0.97,562.094,564.597,Service is grossly insufficient to the needs.,19,,
95,0.97,564.597,574.507,Anyone who can drive a car instead will choose to do so and people who don't have that option will be stranded.,19,,
96,0.97,574.507,579.278,This will impact black and Brown riders the most.,19,,
97,0.97,579.278,580.913,To prevent service cuts.,19,,
98,0.97,580.913,584.817,We support to increase the funds available for transit service.,19,,
99,0.97,584.817,587.92,We support shifting funds from capital to service.,19,,
100,0.97,587.92,595.428,We support the Council taking action in the future to increase the vehicle license fee.,19,,
101,0.97,595.428,597.596,"And to implement, for infrastructure and service.",19,,
102,0.97,597.596,603.936,After much discussion we decided that we support raising the sales tax to .2%.,19,,
103,0.97,603.936,611.911,That is probably the highest impact action you can take today to save our transit decision.,19,,
104,0.97,611.911,614.747,This was not an easy decision.,19,,
105,0.97,614.747,616.816,Going to bat for Progressive since we began.,19,,
106,0.97,616.816,630.262,"We believe this is the right decision to make and we support Councilmember Morales', to make that change.",19,,
107,0.97,630.262,632.031,"Go ahead, Arthur.",20,,
108,0.97,632.031,635.768,Good morning Councilmembers.,21,,
109,0.97,635.768,637.77,My name is Arthur Bacas.,21,,
110,0.97,637.77,641.173,I am a Seattle resident and I rely 100% on transit.,21,,
111,0.97,641.173,649.682,I don't have a car and I work a night shift job that pays my rent and my bills.,21,,
112,0.97,649.682,659.625,"So even with recent cuts to service hours because of Covid, my commutes have become less reliable and are more stressful.",21,,
113,0.97,659.625,666.465,I would imagine any further cuts to transit service would greatly impact by mobility.,21,,
114,0.97,666.465,678.31,"I can only imagine, you know, with such recent changes, the difficulty that Seattleites with lower incomes must face.",21,,
115,0.97,678.31,692.925,"And I would like to request that the Council increase funding as much as possible, including the .2% sales tax as well as dedicating some emergency funding for service in 2021.",21,,
116,0.97,692.925,699.131,I would like to request that we focus funding on improving transit service.,21,,
117,0.97,699.131,706.405,"And that we structure transit service to better serve the needs of people who are transit dependent, myself included.",21,,
118,0.97,706.405,712.611,So we must do the best we can as a city to maintain transit service hours and service quality.,21,,
119,0.97,712.611,713.746,Thank you very much.,21,,
120,0.97,713.746,716.849,Thank you.,22,,
121,0.97,716.849,721.22,"Next we've got, followed by Joe Riley.",22,,
122,0.97,721.22,721.487,Go ahead.,22,,
123,0.97,721.487,723.823,Good morning.,23,,
124,0.97,723.823,732.465,"My name is, and I'm the executive director of--in Seattle.",23,,
125,0.97,732.465,742.942,I'm here as the equity work group.,23,,
126,0.97,742.942,748.881,And we support the Stdd proposal for continuing the sales task.,23,,
127,0.97,748.881,788.554,"By a lot of our group as progressive tax given the changes that are taking place potentially with, not being able to collect additional funds, we feel this is before there's a significant shortfall which we'll not be able to make up in a quick way.",23,,
128,0.97,789.388,797.93,We feel this is a good balance given the current situation.,23,,
129,0.97,797.93,837.469,"Even though the tax rate is of sales tax is against equity for the larger community and our Committee is largely representing marginalized communities, so we feel that we can support an increase even though this initiative was for an existing continuation of the rate given that Seattle is behind other cities which are surrounding on the total tax rate.",23,,
130,0.97,837.469,840.072,Thank you.,24,,
131,0.97,840.072,847.079,Next we've got Joe Riley followed by Joe Kunsler.,24,,
132,0.97,847.079,850.783,Thank you so much for letting me come on today.,25,,
133,0.97,850.783,853.285,My name is Joe Riley.,25,,
134,0.97,853.285,854.72,I'm the development director at Seattle subway.,25,,
135,0.97,854.72,864.563,And there are a few things that our organization feels are prudent and important for the transit benefit district to really deliver on.,25,,
136,0.97,864.563,866.498,And these things are as follows.,25,,
137,0.97,866.498,877.81,"Firstly, we are hoping that we can increase the funding as much as possible with both a .2% sales tax and emergency 2021 funding.",25,,
138,0.97,877.81,890.389,"Second, we're hoping that the Council does focus on and Prioritize spending on transit service as opposed to capital improvement which many of the things could be covered with the move Seattle funds.",25,,
139,0.97,890.389,901.233,"And thirdly, we are hoping that the Council does remember to Prioritize transit service to better serve the needs of people who are transit dependent.",25,,
140,0.97,901.233,905.904,That actually does include myself as someone who recently sold their car.,25,,
141,0.97,905.904,907.239,And that's pretty much it.,25,,
142,0.97,907.239,912.244,I appreciate your time and hope you consider these things in making your decisions today.,25,,
143,0.97,912.244,913.178,Thanks very much.,25,,
144,0.97,913.178,916.682,"Thank you, Joe Riley.",26,,
145,0.97,916.682,921.287,Next we have Joe Kunsler.,27,,
146,0.97,921.287,922.955,"Wow, thank you.",28,,
147,0.97,922.955,931.13,That was a great speech to follow and I'm sure the next 1 will be a harder act to proceed.,28,,
148,0.97,931.13,935.167,I will be brief.,28,,
149,0.97,935.167,940.839,I really support the Seattle transit benefit district that will get more buses on the road.,28,,
150,0.97,940.839,944.977,Transit should be the first choice of everyone to get around.,28,,
151,0.97,944.977,947.479,It's important to Willen to groups.,28,,
152,0.97,947.479,952.184,And we also need bus lanes around Seattle.,28,,
153,0.97,952.184,954.253,I cannot stress this enough.,28,,
154,0.97,954.253,957.656,We need buses not to be stuck in traffic.,28,,
155,0.97,957.656,964.296,And you can also use bus lanes as bike lanes.,28,,
156,0.97,964.296,968.634,Maryland did the same.,28,,
157,0.97,968.634,970.002,"We also, Heidi wells.",28,,
158,0.97,970.002,975.274,And some of our heroes who normally would not be recognized.,28,,
159,0.97,975.274,980.212,We need to be enthusiastic about this campaign.,28,,
160,0.97,980.212,986.618,By absolutely vital that we remember our heroes like Heidi wells and get this done.,28,,
161,0.97,986.618,992.624,"Otherwise, I'm going to give 25 bucks to the campaign and call it good.",28,,
162,0.97,992.624,998.33,"With that, I really hope that, you know, this is a 4-year measure.",28,,
163,0.97,998.33,1002.634,And it's important that we have a 4-year measure.,28,,
164,0.97,1002.634,1015.547,This will be pressure on King County government to come to the table and be serious.,28,,
165,0.97,1015.547,1016.615,They need to understand.,28,,
166,0.97,1016.615,1017.95,Okay.,29,,
167,0.97,1017.95,1020.452,So thank you.,29,,
168,0.97,1020.452,1025.424,Next up is Alex Hudson followed by Ryan Packer.,29,,
169,0.97,1025.424,1025.858,If Alex is there.,29,,
170,0.97,1025.991,1034.066,"Councilmember, we don't see an Alex Hudson in the caller list.",30,,
171,0.97,1034.066,1036.235,Okay.,31,,
172,0.97,1036.235,1039.138,We'll come back to Alex Hudson.,31,,
173,0.97,1039.138,1045.11,So next up we've got Ryan Packer followed by Anthony Damico.,31,,
174,0.97,1045.11,1046.111,"Go ahead, Ryan Packer.",32,,
175,0.97,1046.111,1047.546,Thank you.,33,,
176,0.97,1047.546,1048.58,My name is Ryan Packer.,33,,
177,0.97,1048.58,1063.896,I support all of the amendments except for the amendment 2 which would invest in inexpensive alternatives.,33,,
178,0.97,1063.896,1080.512,It would be a great irony for days after the city council who just voted to invest heavily in the green new deal to then decide that they were not going to fully invest in Seattle's transit network.,33,,
179,0.97,1080.512,1097.896,"From 2008 to 2016, the greatest reduction per capita in greenhouse gas emissions in Seattle was not improved energy efficiency for vehicles or heating.",33,,
180,0.97,1097.896,1100.132,It was reduced vehicle trips.,33,,
181,0.97,1100.132,1103.836,25% of the reduction was focused on those.,33,,
182,0.97,1103.836,1105.838,We need to go bigger.,33,,
183,0.97,1105.838,1119.418,.2% is the floor we need to be able to be in for and not the Uncontainable unattainable ceiling.,33,,
184,0.97,1119.418,1122.254,Massive bus cuts are even more Regressve.,33,,
185,0.97,1122.254,1126.558,And selling out the future is also very Regressive.,33,,

196,0.97,1169.801,1175.007,I despise sales tax increases and they impact low income households.,35,,

206,0.97,1219.651,1228.36,I'm disabled and don't have a driver's license and I ride exclusively transit to doctor's appointments among other things.,37,,
207,0.97,1228.36,1248.58,So I just specifically wanted to say that I support Morales amendment to double the size of the measure because I really hate Regressive taxes but again I ride only transit and the need for transit is so important.,37,,
208,0.97,1248.58,1252.451,Lessen the damage of not having transit.,37,,

216,0.97,1275.641,1285.284,And we need to recognize our interconnected it is to so many other issues and when it falls apart it impacts everyone in the city.,40,,
217,0.97,1285.284,1292.524,And it's really regrettable that the funding is falling on a Regressive sales tax.,40,,
218,0.97,1292.524,1298.73,"In general, also please try and change Seattle's Regressive tax code.",40,,

224,0.97,1308.54,1319.084,Executive director of [inaudible] we are fully supportive and it's clear and obvious that there's a need for transit service and will be in the future.,42,,
225,0.97,1319.084,1331.263,We think that the renewal can be improved by adoption of amendment 1 which assures money for service and Pathway.,42,,
226,0.97,1331.263,1341.64,Amendment 3 Shortens the duration and gets us to a time when we can have more clarity to get us to a Countywide measure with Progressive revenue.,42,,
227,0.97,1341.64,1350.515,"Amendment 5, thank you to chair Pedersen for guaranteeing that most of the money goes to service.",42,,
228,0.97,1350.515,1362.861,And amendment 7 assures that the evaluation of the funding with a racial equity bolstered by the mobility framework.,42,,
229,0.97,1362.861,1365.63,To drive service where need is most.,42,,
230,0.97,1365.63,1373.872,And issue of point 2. it's a sad reality that Regressive sales taxes are a limited option available to us.,42,,
231,0.97,1373.872,1379.511,Transit service is vital.,42,,
232,0.97,1379.511,1387.018,"And increasing .2 would prevent 100,000 hours of transit service cuts at a time when people are in need most.",42,,

248,0.97,1471.97,1482.314,Council President Gonzalez established this committee so we can put in front of voters the opportunity to renew the funding that's expiring for our successful transportation benefit district.,45,,
249,0.97,1482.314,1491.923,The benefit district is a key tool Washington state law provides to raise money for transportation needs.,45,,
250,0.97,1491.923,1494.359,Focused on supplementing bus service.,45,,
251,0.97,1494.359,1498.196,Providing free transit passes to those in need.,45,,

259,0.97,1549.581,1562.56,And we do have amendment that is being locked on by Councilmember Morales about the level of the sales tax that's proposed.,45,,
260,0.97,1562.56,1569.301,And so our colleagues from the executive are here to answer questions.,45,,
261,0.97,1569.301,1577.108,"I imagine colleagues, you'll probably direct most of your questions to Calvin chow.",45,,

265,0.97,1599.564,1605.236,The bill transmitted to us by the executive provided a solid foundation.,45,,
266,0.97,1605.236,1608.74,And we as Councilmembers would hear from the public and amend the legislation.,45,,
267,0.97,1608.74,1618.65,One of the key themes of the amendments is that we heard the call to increase the emphasis on transit service even more.,45,,
268,0.97,1618.65,1629.728,"For example, amendment number 1 which we'll talk about soon will Reallocate from capital projects to transit service.",45,,
269,0.97,1629.728,1633.465,Amendment number 4 would protect transit service throughout the life of the measure.,45,,

298,0.97,1776.474,1782.18,First let me pause to say that these are unprecedented times.,49,,
299,0.97,1782.18,1787.786,Prior to the devastating impact of Covid-19 on our community and on communities across the world.,49,,
300,0.97,1787.786,1793.825,"I personally could not have imagined all the ways my life, work, and travel choices have changed.",49,,
301,0.97,1793.825,1800.131,I could not have imagined the impact to our economy or transit system.,49,,
302,0.97,1800.131,1804.936,Prior to the public health crisis.,49,,
303,0.97,1804.936,1816.848,"I could not, in the first few months of the Covid pandemic I thought we might not get the chance to stand before you.",49,,
304,0.97,1816.848,1824.856,The advisory board members believe that it will play a critical role in our recovery.,49,,
305,0.97,1824.856,1832.73,And it provides a lifeline for low income residents.,49,,
306,0.97,1832.73,1841.372,Seattle needs additional public transportation to recover from Covid and to meet the environmental justice goals.,49,,
307,0.97,1841.372,1847.245,We support the inclusion of low income Orca programs.,49,,
308,0.97,1847.245,1850.348,To enable those residents hardest hit by the pandemic.,49,,
309,0.97,1850.348,1855.086,And we support the use of STBD funds.,49,,
310,0.97,1855.086,1865.263,And we think this program should continue focusing on projects that make transit flow better.,49,,
311,0.97,1865.263,1874.105,Policies that concentrate on transit dense corridors will give us the best bang for our Buck.,49,,
312,0.97,1874.105,1880.111,"In addition to this strong support, we have a few improvements we would like to suggest.",50,,
313,0.97,1880.111,1888.853,1 item that we think is missing from the proposal red Un- Amaintainedded measure.,50,,
314,0.97,1888.853,1893.591,We believe the core should be transit service itself.,50,,
315,0.97,1893.591,1897.228,The district purchase of transit hours from King County Metro.,50,,
316,0.97,1897.228,1902.634,"Without a strong transit, a free Orca card is not useful.",50,,
317,0.97,1902.634,1907.739,We support to ensure the additional service is reliable and equitable.,50,,
318,0.97,1907.739,1917.148,In prior years we needed additional spending options because Metro could not sell us the amount we wanted to buy.,50,,
319,0.97,1917.148,1918.616,This will.,50,,
320,0.97,1918.616,1923.254,We cannot let flexibility of the Measuredetract from the core of the measure.,50,,
321,0.97,1923.254,1928.059,Have a guarantee on the amount of bus service.,50,,
322,0.97,1928.059,1934.065,"The transit advisory, 2/3 of the yearly sales tax revenue go towards the purchase of transit service.",50,,
323,0.97,1934.065,1940.271,Could be a part of the emerging needs of West Seattle or other neighborhoods.,50,,
324,0.97,1940.271,1952.583,We need to stay focused on the core of STBD providing service for Seattle residents.,50,,
325,0.97,1952.583,1957.555,1 backbone of the transit system is link light rail.,50,,
326,0.97,1957.555,1959.257,It connects many neighborhoods together.,50,,
327,0.97,1959.257,1965.396,Any measure on the ballot needs to be able to fund this.,50,,
328,0.97,1965.396,1982.58,"Again, we just want to reiterate that we strongly support a 6 year STBD renewal measure.",50,,
329,0.97,1982.58,1990.388,"We appreciate your, and my staff went to your meeting and thank you for your input today.",50,,

340,0.97,2053.584,2058.256,Let's go ahead and move that amendment.,54,,
341,0.97,2058.256,2064.796,"Councilmember Herbold, would you like to move that amendment?",54,,
342,0.97,2064.796,2069.5,"Oh, you're on mute.",54,,

348,0.97,2092.723,2099.097,I will keep my comments short.,57,,
349,0.97,2099.097,2102.733,Cosponsored by Pedersen and her bold.,57,,
350,0.97,2102.733,2108.673,"And describes the license fee authority if, were to be overturned.",57,,
351,0.97,2108.673,2124.055,Úand Readvises section 2-D. it allows up to $9 million of funding for in 2021 only and then for every year thereafter it reduces that to $3 million per year.,57,,
352,0.97,2124.055,2128.759,"Thank you, Calvin.",58,,
353,0.97,2128.759,2130.128,So this amendment is very important.,58,,
354,0.97,2130.128,2139.437,"There was a concern that the measure that was transmitted that there wasn't, that people wanted a bigger emphasis on transit.",58,,
355,0.97,2139.437,2142.44,So this measure is saying that we heard you.,58,,
356,0.97,2142.44,2166.697,We are moving a substantial portion of those dollars out of the capital bucket which is subsection 2-D and we're moving it out which would go into transit hours.,58,,
357,0.97,2166.697,2169.467,It's a $6 million movement.,59,,
358,0.97,2169.467,2170.935,A significant increase.,59,,
359,0.97,2170.935,2179.477,We want to thank all the advocates who pointed that owl after they digested the bill.,59,,
360,0.97,2179.477,2182.98,And emphasized transit in this measure.,59,,
361,0.97,2182.98,2183.781,Councilmember Herbold?,59,,
362,0.97,2183.781,2186.851,I think you've covered it very well.,60,,
363,0.97,2186.851,2198.93,And I appreciate working with you to bring forward this amendment to ensure that this measure is focused on transit service.,60,,
364,0.97,2198.93,2199.263,Thank you.,61,,
365,0.97,2199.263,2199.897,"Councilmembers, questions?",61,,
366,0.97,2199.897,2213.945,"Okay, so we can go ahead and vote on this.",61,,
367,0.97,2213.945,2215.68,Last call for questions on this 1.,61,,
368,0.97,2215.68,2219.45,Thank you.,61,,

370,0.97,2222.753,2226.224,You're on mute still.,62,,
371,0.97,2226.357,2234.365,Thank you.,63,,
372,0.97,2234.365,2235.933,"On the one hand, I'm sorry.",63,,
373,0.97,2235.933,2237.969,I will hold off.,63,,
374,0.97,2237.969,2244.976,I think I'm mixing up the amendments.,63,,
375,0.97,2244.976,2245.543,Thank you.,64,,
376,0.97,2245.543,2249.78,Amendment 1 has been moved and Seconded.,64,,

378,0.97,2250.581,2253.985,We talked about comments.,64,,
379,0.97,2253.985,2260.358,Will the clerk call the roll on adoption of number 1.,64,,
380,0.97,2260.358,2261.592,Juarez.,65,,

396,0.97,2283.314,2285.149,"8 in favor, none opposed.",80,,
397,0.97,2285.149,2289.32,The motion carries and the amendment is adopted.,81,,
398,0.97,2289.32,2291.789,Let's continue with the next amendment.,81,,
399,0.97,2291.789,2292.99,Amendment number 2.,81,,
400,0.97,2292.99,2301.832,"I'll go ahead and move the amendment and we'll get a second and then we'll hear, actually, go ahead, Cal.",81,,
401,0.97,2301.832,2305.936,I'll stick to the script and have you go first.,81,,
402,0.97,2305.936,2309.94,Amendment 2 is sponsored by Councilmember Pedersen.,82,,
403,0.97,2309.94,2316.814,It would add a whereas clause in the first mile and last mile programs.,82,,
404,0.97,2316.814,2325.823,"And it would revise section 2 E to include, in the emerging needs category of spending.",82,,
405,0.97,2325.823,2328.059,"Thank you, Calvin.",83,,
406,0.97,2328.059,2336.834,"So amendment number 2, as we know, one of the challenges is getting people out of their cars and getting them to transit and to light rail.",83,,
407,0.97,2336.834,2345.443,And there are some programs that King County and Seattle have experimented with.,83,,
408,0.97,2345.443,2353.584,And the Via program in South Seattle the ride to in West Seattle.,83,,
409,0.97,2353.584,2355.252,This puts in a whereas clause.,83,,
410,0.97,2355.252,2367.164,"We've done this work, and it puts in subsection 2 E. it mentions first last mile transit connections to within that category.",83,,
411,0.97,2367.164,2368.466,Of emerging mobility needs.,83,,
412,0.97,2368.466,2377.007,"It just put that is in there as an authorized use of funds, it does not assign a dollar amount.",83,,
413,0.97,2377.007,2381.212,It does not detract from anything else.,83,,
414,0.97,2381.212,2387.418,"It puts the notion of first, last transit connections as an option for the future.",83,,
415,0.97,2387.418,2396.694,So why don't I move this amendment and then we'll hear from everybody if they have questions.,83,,
416,0.97,2396.694,2403.601,I move to amend as presented on amendment 2. is there a second?,83,,
417,0.97,2403.601,2403.901,Second.,84,,
418,0.97,2403.901,2404.802,Thank you.,85,,
419,0.97,2404.802,2412.643,"So it's been moved and Seconded and we've heard from central staff and me as the sponsor, happy to answer any questions about amendment 2.",85,,
420,0.97,2412.943,2417.882,Councilmember Herbold.,86,,
421,0.97,2419.15,2425.356,Not so much a question but more of a statement.,87,,
422,0.97,2425.356,2433.531,I just want to recognize that it is true that there has been low Ridership in the past.,87,,
423,0.97,2433.531,2449.28,But I think that was because of some limited accessibility issues in some of the neighborhoods where the type of services were offered.,87,,
424,0.97,2449.28,2452.883,"There was some low Ridership in Southeast, West Seattle.",87,,
425,0.97,2452.883,2456.987,And the App did not work as well as it could have.,87,,
426,0.97,2456.987,2464.295,"The fact that this does not require the use of funds, it merely includes it as a potential use.",87,,
427,0.97,2464.295,2467.598,I think it's an important inclusion.,87,,
428,0.97,2467.598,2474.505,I do believe that these last mile services are really important.,87,,
429,0.97,2474.505,2491.222,And I think that Sdot and Metro can work together to ensure that some of the glitches that people experience in the past can be addressed and so I do support the flexibility to allow this.,87,,
430,0.97,2491.222,2492.289,Thank you.,87,,
431,0.97,2492.289,2494.525,Thank you Councilmember Herbold.,88,,
432,0.97,2494.525,2500.498,Any other comments or questions about amendment 2? okay.,88,,
433,0.97,2500.498,2511.809,Will the clerk please call the roll on the adoption of amendment 2.,88,,

451,0.97,2537.134,2539.837,Thank you.,106,,
452,0.97,2539.837,2543.474,The motion carries and the amendment is adopted.,106,,
453,0.97,2543.474,2547.244,"Calvin, if you could please continue with the next amendment.",106,,
454,0.97,2547.244,2547.711,Amendment number 3.,106,,
455,0.97,2547.711,2552.65,And then we'll hear from the sponsors.,106,,
456,0.97,2552.65,2558.455,Number 3 is sponsored by Councilmember.,107,,
457,0.97,2558.455,2564.728,To reduce the term of the measure from 6 years to 4 years.,107,,
458,0.97,2567.598,2568.666,Okay.,108,,
459,0.97,2568.666,2569.867,So Councilmember Morales.,108,,
460,0.97,2569.867,2575.005,"Would you like to speak to this amendment, please.",108,,
461,0.97,2575.005,2579.71,Sure.,109,,
462,0.97,2579.71,2585.95,"Thank you, chair speed chair Pedersen.",109,,
463,0.97,2585.95,2589.553,This amendment would address some of the problem.,110,,
464,0.97,2589.553,2592.222,Let me back up.,110,,
465,0.97,2592.222,2602.032,"We know that reducing service hours from 300,000 to 80,000 which is what we are being asked to do with this package is a draconian response.",110,,
466,0.97,2602.032,2608.505,And we know that communities of color will bear the burden of these cuts.,110,,
467,0.97,2608.505,2630.427,"And so this amendment is intended to shorten the length of the proposal mostly because we don't want to box ourselves in to a 6 year service cut when we could be coming out of the financial crisis before the end of that term hopefully, before the end of the 4 year term even.",110,,
468,0.97,2630.427,2635.966,This is an attempt to acknowledge that we have a proposal before us.,110,,
469,0.97,2635.966,2640.504,We need to make sure that we are ensuring some degree of service.,110,,
470,0.97,2640.504,2647.344,"And because of the nature of the drastic cuts that we're making, we want to shorten the time as much as possible.",110,,
471,0.97,2647.344,2656.954,And we are moving this amendment to reduce the term of the initiative from 6 years to 4 years.,110,,
472,0.97,2656.954,2663.494,And I want to thank Councilmember Gonzalez for her Cosponsorship of the amendment.,110,,
473,0.97,2663.494,2666.964,"Councilmember Lewis, did you have a comment?",111,,
474,0.97,2666.964,2669.366,I am proud to support this amendment.,112,,
475,0.97,2669.366,2685.582,"I think it is a good reflection that even though the transit benefit district is an essential and critical investment, just acknowledging that our tools are limited, the economy is shaky right now.",112,,
476,0.97,2685.582,2698.796,"And hopefully, the picture in 4 years will be 1 of recovery and 1 of options to stand up to the future of this essential service.",112,,
477,0.97,2698.796,2707.104,So I completely endorse the different Timeline and will be voting for this amendment.,112,,
478,0.97,2707.104,2711.742,Councilmember Herbold.,113,,
479,0.97,2711.742,2713.01,You're on mute.,113,,
480,0.97,2713.01,2717.548,I have a question for Cal.,114,,
481,0.97,2717.548,2734.198,"I'm wondering if we kept the language as is but instead included language that said that we did not intend to collect, if there was a regional measure.",114,,
482,0.97,2734.198,2737.835,Is that something that we could do.,114,,
483,0.97,2737.835,2758.055,"And the reason I ask is, we went through this situation last year when we were, there were some Councilmembers that were very, very interested in putting forward a regional measure and some that were not.",114,,
484,0.97,2758.055,2761.592,And last year we really had to scramble.,114,,
485,0.97,2761.592,2767.364,Or this year we've had to scramble because we were waiting on the county.,114,,
486,0.97,2767.364,2775.606,"I was on the regional committee last year, and it was challenging for the King County Councilmembers who wanted to move forward.",114,,
487,0.97,2775.606,2784.982,King County had a related issue of road funding which was not easy to separate and will not be easy to separate in the future.,114,,
488,0.97,2784.982,2803.133,And so I just don't want us here in Seattle to be left in the position we were in in 2014 when we had to settle on a quickly measure while being clear that Seattle supports a county wide measure.,114,,
489,0.97,2803.133,2807.237,And I'm wondering if we could have a little flexibility.,114,,
490,0.97,2807.237,2813.544,Ballot measure would give the city the authorization to impose a sales tax but it doesn't require it.,115,,
491,0.97,2813.544,2818.148,It's not the position of it itself.,115,,
492,0.97,2818.148,2821.218,A future Council could not collect the tax in the future.,115,,
493,0.97,2821.218,2840.47,"I could imagine if the county were to put a ballot measure, propose a ballot measure, I think it would be possible for Council to pass an ordinance that conditional, the city would not collect in the future.",115,,
494,0.97,2840.47,2854.918,"If you were intending to include language like that in this legislation, I would suggest a whereas clause because that's a future Council action that would be involved.",115,,
495,0.97,2854.918,2857.855,"Thank you, Cal.",116,,
496,0.97,2857.855,2858.956,Mr. chair?,117,,
497,0.97,2858.956,2859.99,"Yes, Councilmember Juarez.",118,,
498,0.97,2859.99,2864.995,I meant to try to text you quickly.,119,,
499,0.97,2864.995,2866.496,I agree with Councilmember Herbold.,119,,
500,0.97,2866.496,2877.875,I agree there's a way to look at the fourth year and hold out on years 5 and 6. and this is a question for Cal.,119,,
501,0.97,2877.875,2899.496,We are looking at 20 to $30 million annually as you know to plug a lot of transportation budget holes . Maybe Calvin can address is issue of I 976 and what that variable means.,119,,
502,0.97,2899.496,2906.737,And we discussed this before about how this would change the picture as it stands today.,119,,
503,0.97,2906.737,2911.108,Is there some analysis about that?,119,,
504,0.97,2911.108,2912.309,Just moving forward.,119,,
505,0.97,2912.309,2917.114,"Calvin, I know you mentioned it in your memo, your fiscal NOTE and memo.",119,,
506,0.97,2917.114,2919.683,That's why I bring it up.,119,,
507,0.97,2919.683,2923.553,Sure.,120,,
508,0.97,2923.553,2926.89,The vehicle license fee is prohibited by initiative I 976.,120,,
509,0.97,2926.89,2931.862,And the city is part of a lawsuit that's challenging that.,120,,
510,0.97,2931.862,2937.034,We don't have a timetable for when that decision will be decided.,120,,
511,0.97,2937.034,2946.543,But if we are successful in overturning I 976 we would have that revenue source available to us.,120,,
512,0.97,2946.543,2950.681,There are 2 elements in state law.,120,,
513,0.97,2950.681,2953.216,1 does not require voter approval.,120,,
514,0.97,2953.216,2963.593,And we currently have a $20 vehicle license fee that the Seattle district has imposed.,120,,
515,0.97,2963.593,2971.668,The council could increase that if I 976 is opposed.,120,,
516,0.97,2971.668,2975.605,And after 2 years of having the $40 year in place.,120,,
517,0.97,2975.605,2979.009,The law allows the Council to increase that to $50.,120,,
518,0.97,2979.009,2989.753,"Separately, there is also a voter approved authority of vehicle license fees that could go up to $100 which would require a vote of the people.",120,,
519,0.97,2989.753,2993.623,And is subject to initiative I 976.,120,,
520,0.97,2993.623,2998.061,Vehicle license fee authority is chaired by other overlapping benefit districts.,120,,
521,0.97,2998.061,3008.238,"So if the King County benefit district decided to pursue vehicle license fees, those limits are jointly shared.",120,,
522,0.97,3008.238,3018.648,I should add that the vehicle license fee for the current spending that we're collecting now.,120,,
523,0.97,3018.648,3034.064,We did get a temporary injunction to continue to collect and we're holding money in reserve in case we have to refund those collections back to last year's election.,120,,
524,0.97,3034.064,3040.537,The funding last year was a $60 vehicle that generated half of the money we were collecting.,120,,
525,0.97,3040.537,3051.415,"Depending on the size, you can imagine more or less doubling the amount of spending that's considered here.",120,,
526,0.97,3051.415,3051.848,Thank you.,121,,
527,0.97,3051.848,3059.089,I'd like to put out on the table some of the rationale for the 6 year proposal that was transmitted to us.,122,,
528,0.97,3059.089,3062.793,I know there was a lot of thought that went into it.,122,,
529,0.97,3062.793,3075.172,"And 4 years was considered by the executive and they decided on the 6 years, just to sort of lay that out on the table for the public that may not be following it as closely.",122,,
530,0.97,3075.172,3077.974,The reason 6 years was chosen.,122,,
531,0.97,3077.974,3085.182,They believe in the measure and we believe in it and we want to have it for longer.,122,,
532,0.97,3085.182,3102.732,The 4 years if we have it for just 4 years and that's when King County wants a regional measure in 4 years because a regional measure would probably do better in a presidential election.,122,,
533,0.97,3102.732,3119.616,"King County is targeting a regional measure and ours expires in 4 years, it creates a cliff where we have no leverage with King county in terms of the control of the extra dollars that we would be paying for.",122,,
534,0.97,3119.616,3125.655,"And so if, you can't negotiate with King County, our measure expires and that's a problem.",122,,
535,0.97,3125.655,3147.143,"I think that if ours is 6 years, there's nothing that Precludes us from doing a regional measure with King County 2 years from now, 4 years from now.",122,,
536,0.97,3147.143,3153.55,I think that's a concern is that we would have less certainty in these dollars to Seattle if we shorten the time.,122,,
537,0.97,3153.55,3161.691,And another issue is that the move Seattle levy expires in 4 years.,122,,
538,0.97,3161.691,3168.798,"Creating a situation where it's very high stakes in terms of transportation dollars, everything is happening at once.",122,,
539,0.97,3168.798,3172.068,And we don't know what the environment will be at that time.,122,,
540,0.97,3172.068,3179.776,The 6 years provides a couple years cushion where as Councilmember Herbold was alluding to.,122,,
541,0.97,3179.776,3183.013,We can choose not to collect the tax.,122,,
542,0.97,3183.013,3185.382,We can wind down the measure.,122,,
543,0.97,3185.382,3187.984,It also gives us leverage with King County.,122,,
544,0.97,3187.984,3202.933,I think that covers sort of the rationale of the 6 years just to put that out there for everybody who might be trying to decide what to do here.,122,,
545,0.97,3202.933,3204.634,"Thank you, chair Peterson.",123,,
546,0.97,3204.634,3206.636,That's very helpful.,123,,
547,0.97,3206.636,3218.715,I was going to ask Councilmember Morales if she might be able to remind us of the rationale for 4 so I can hear them back to back.,123,,
548,0.97,3218.715,3224.221,What we're looking at is the drastic nature of the cuts we're talking about.,124,,
549,0.97,3224.221,3231.895,"And while I acknowledge that if we do a 4 year, the renewal would come at the same time as the county measure.",124,,
550,0.97,3231.895,3234.464,I think that's kind of the point.,124,,
551,0.97,3234.464,3238.768,We really want to be moving towards a regional solution anyway.,124,,
552,0.97,3238.768,3270.567,"And we really want to make sure that we're not locking ourselves in to a proposal and a package that is risking potentially, depending on which of these, hundreds of thousands of hours of service for longer periods of time, particularly for communities that are going to be disproportionately impacted by the cuts.",124,,
553,0.97,3270.567,3273.203,"Councilmember Mosqueda, is that helpful?",125,,
554,0.97,3273.203,3275.138,"Yes, thank you very much.",126,,
555,0.97,3275.138,3281.411,Quick question for Calvin.,127,,
556,0.97,3281.411,3290.687,"Is there in this measure as it stands, are there commitments to Regionalism baked into the measure already?",127,,
557,0.97,3290.687,3296.359,I believe there's a number of statements about Regionalism.,128,,
558,0.97,3296.359,3300.096,Do you have a specific commitment that you have in mind?,128,,
559,0.97,3300.096,3301.431,"No, no.",129,,
560,0.97,3301.431,3311.541,I just believed there was language in there committing us to work with King County to do a regional measure in the future.,129,,
561,0.97,3311.541,3313.943,And the legislation does have some intent behind that.,129,,
562,0.97,3313.943,3316.813,We can get back to that in a minute.,129,,
563,0.97,3316.813,3323.486,And I think we've got Councilmembers Strauss and Herbold.,129,,
564,0.97,3323.486,3326.856,"Go ahead, Councilmember Strauss.",129,,
565,0.97,3326.856,3332.295,"Thank you, chair Pedersen.",130,,
566,0.97,3332.295,3337.067,We are all in agreement that the regional approach is the best way forward.,131,,
567,0.97,3337.067,3344.374,And we're all trying to find a way we can put our measure forward and a way that provides the most amount of service possible at this time.,131,,
568,0.97,3344.374,3351.981,And we are trying to protect the future in incredibly uncertain times.,131,,
569,0.97,3351.981,3357.02,I am torn between 4 years and 6 years because there are benefits to both.,131,,
570,0.97,3357.02,3369.699,And those benefits are the weight of each of those benefits is unknown right now because we don't know how long the recession will take.,131,,
571,0.97,3369.699,3375.004,We don't really understand voter appetite.,131,,
572,0.97,3375.004,3383.713,And also the amount of regional transportation change that will happen when the Redmond light rail opens.,131,,
573,0.97,3383.713,3390.019,All of these uncertainties make this decision difficult especially in the tight Timeline.,131,,
574,0.97,3390.019,3395.258,And in addition to all of the things that Council is putting forward.,131,,
575,0.97,3395.258,3401.197,I am having a hard time making this decision.,131,,
576,0.97,3401.197,3403.5,"Thank you, Councilmember.",132,,
577,0.97,3403.5,3404.1,"Oh, yes.",132,,
578,0.97,3404.1,3410.807,If I may just the second to last clause does describe the intent.,133,,
579,0.97,3410.807,3421.918,It highlights the importance of the regional public transportation network and supports.,133,,
580,0.97,3421.918,3430.66,The transit advisory board members mentioned the rationale for 6 years.,134,,
581,0.97,3430.66,3433.396,"Councilmember Herbold, did you have comments?",134,,
582,0.97,3433.396,3437.133,That was my question.,135,,
583,0.97,3437.133,3447.143,I know that the transit advisory board expressed the rationale for the 6 year patrolmen 6 year term.,135,,
584,0.97,3447.143,3466.796,And I don't know if they've had a chance to Opine on this amendment or if their explanation was in response to their knowledge of this amendment being out there.,135,,
585,0.97,3466.796,3476.973,So just interested to know specifically what their position would be on this amendment as opposed to just hearing why they proposed a 6 year term.,135,,
586,0.97,3476.973,3485.648,And we'll give Councilmember Morales the last word on this as the sponsor of the amendment.,136,,
587,0.97,3485.648,3491.521,"And Councilmember Sawant, please.",136,,
588,0.97,3491.521,3493.223,Thank you.,137,,
589,0.97,3493.223,3500.396,I will be voting yes on this amendment.,137,,
590,0.97,3500.396,3501.931,Too small and too Regressive.,137,,
591,0.97,3501.931,3503.867,It's bad in every way.,137,,
592,0.97,3503.867,3505.935,It's a Regressive tax.,137,,
593,0.97,3505.935,3508.538,It's a continuation of a Regressive tax.,137,,
594,0.97,3508.538,3525.922,And might I point out how strange and stunning it is that we're putting a ballot measure for a Regressive tax Afte about a week and a half of having voted on a very progressive task and historic measure.,137,,
595,0.97,3525.922,3530.96,It's strange to be talking about this.,137,,
596,0.97,3530.96,3533.796,It's both Regressive and it's an austerity measure.,137,,
597,0.97,3533.796,3537.267,There's a cut involved.,137,,
598,0.97,3537.267,3539.769,"And I agree with, a draconian cut.",137,,
599,0.97,3539.769,3543.94,"The sooner we can have a chance to correct these things, the better.",137,,
600,0.97,3543.94,3560.79,"And ultimately, I would say of course, ultimately, it's not a question of 4 years or 6 years, it's a question of whether we have a movement to get organized and win a full funding of public transit.",137,,
601,0.97,3560.79,3569.098,"And actually go, the goals that transit advocates and environmental activists in our community have been talking about.",137,,
602,0.97,3569.098,3572.769,And ultimately is a question of the movement.,137,,
603,0.97,3572.769,3593.489,"But I do think that having the this amendment in a point in the, and also I would say that the amendment from my office is coming and it's pointing towards progressive revenues.",137,,
604,0.97,3593.489,3597.327,"Ultimately, that's not enough.",137,,
605,0.97,3597.327,3599.128,And future councils.,137,,
606,0.97,3599.128,3606.836,"And last but not least, I would say Councilmember Pedersen said we believe in this measure.",137,,
607,0.97,3606.836,3614.143,And I wanted to say that's not speaking for my position.,137,,
608,0.97,3614.143,3622.452,"And on top of that a, potentially has austerity written into it.",137,,
609,0.97,3622.452,3628.458,Full funding.,137,,
610,0.97,3628.458,3629.158,Thank you.,137,,
611,0.97,3629.158,3634.63,"Council chair, you're on mute actually.",138,,
612,0.97,3634.63,3636.065,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant.",139,,
613,0.97,3636.065,3637.867,"Councilmember Mosqueda, do you have a comment?",139,,
614,0.97,3637.867,3641.671,I wanted to put out there my opinion on this.,140,,
615,0.97,3641.671,3647.877,I think that it's not strange that we're having a conversation about sending this to the voters.,140,,
616,0.97,3647.877,3655.885,The big difference between this and what we voted on last week was a large progressive tax on corporations.,140,,
617,0.97,3655.885,3659.756,Does not tax individuals and does not tax jobs.,140,,
618,0.97,3659.756,3664.46,I think this Council has said unanimously and I appreciate that clarification.,140,,
619,0.97,3664.46,3669.465,The reason this goes to the voters is because this is a tax on individuals.,140,,
620,0.97,3669.465,3674.203,And I think it's rightly asking them if they want to be taxed more.,140,,
621,0.97,3674.203,3683.312,I would like to see this be shortened to the amendment that Councilmember Morales and Gonzalez have put out there.,140,,
622,0.97,3683.312,3687.684,We recognize that we're doing this because we have so few tools in our tool box.,140,,
623,0.97,3687.684,3697.326,And the 1 tool we used was our ability to legally use the progressive tax.,140,,
624,0.97,3697.326,3700.43,Including Portland and other cities in the region.,140,,
625,0.97,3700.43,3702.031,I think that's the difference here.,140,,
626,0.97,3702.031,3713.543,And I think it makes a lot of sense to think about how this could dove tail to other regional and state issues which we're trying to do on other strategies as well.,140,,
627,0.97,3713.543,3733.996,I wanted to support this amendment and also I think offer that Clarifcation at least from my position on why we are going down this route but only because it's one of the few tools in our tool box as we try to create additional progressive tools.,140,,
628,0.97,3733.996,3734.931,Thank you.,141,,
629,0.97,3734.931,3749.679,And do we want to give--I'm thinking that if the transportation advisory board is still here and they want 30 seconds or a minute to talk about the rationale.,141,,
630,0.97,3749.679,3750.746,We have Councilmember Sawant.,141,,
631,0.97,3750.746,3754.951,And we'll let Councilmember Morales have the last word.,141,,
632,0.97,3754.951,3758.554,"Erin, if you're still here, you can speak to it.",141,,
633,0.97,3758.554,3761.791,I think we summarized it pretty well.,141,,
634,0.97,3761.791,3767.063,But I want to give you 1 last comment.,141,,
635,0.97,3767.063,3783.112,"And I want to toss out this idea, thinking outside the box on the fly, what could possibly go wrong.",141,,
636,0.97,3783.112,3785.815,If Councilmember Morales would view a 5 year.,141,,
637,0.97,3785.815,3793.923,It would give us leverage with King County when we're negotiating a new measure in 4 years.,141,,
638,0.97,3793.923,3796.793,You can think about that.,142,,
639,0.97,3796.793,3800.429,And we can hear from Councilmember Sawant.,142,,
640,0.97,3800.429,3804.734,However you want to do it.,142,,
641,0.97,3804.734,3806.536,Councilmember Sawant.,142,,
642,0.97,3806.536,3813.442,And we can wrap up with Councilmember more regardless.,142,,
643,0.97,3813.442,3819.315,"If Councilmember Morales wants to speak, I'm happy to wait.",143,,
644,0.97,3819.315,3820.449,Thank you.,144,,
645,0.97,3820.449,3829.458,"Yeah, I guess what I want to say is as we all know the future is a little uncertain.",144,,
646,0.97,3829.458,3832.094,We are in a financial crisis.,144,,
647,0.97,3832.094,3840.369,"And at the same time, in 4 years, we will have several more light rail stations.",144,,
648,0.97,3840.369,3844.974,We will have an interest.,144,,
649,0.97,3844.974,3851.38,People will have been able to take advantage and see what good transit looks like.,144,,
650,0.97,3851.38,3856.853,We have had incredible Ridership lately because of the investment that we've made.,144,,
651,0.97,3856.853,3870.766,"And so, I agree with Councilmember Strauss that we have nod had nearly enough time to process this and think carefully to do the outreach to make sure we are hearing from our constituents.",144,,
652,0.97,3870.766,3905.167,"And I think that kind of uncertainty is what is driving this interest in making sure that because this is a huge cut and because we want to move towards more progressive options as soon as possible, I think I want to stick with the 4 years and give us the opportunity to really spend that time working on the strategy for making the kind of improvements that we would prefer to see and the kind of investments that we would prefer to see.",144,,
653,0.97,3905.167,3908.738,Thank you.,145,,
654,0.97,3908.738,3910.239,Councilmember Sawant.,145,,
655,0.97,3910.239,3911.474,And then maybe Councilmember Strauss.,145,,
656,0.97,3911.474,3912.742,Thank you.,146,,
657,0.97,3912.742,3924.253,"I just wanted to say in response to some of the discussion earlier that I mean Legislatively speaking yes, it is different.",146,,
658,0.97,3924.253,3926.656,The Amazon bill passed by the city council.,146,,
659,0.97,3926.656,3941.17,And absolutely and I really appreciate the combined effort of the Council here to have made it crystal clear that that is not a tax on jobs and small businesses and workers.,146,,
660,0.97,3941.17,3944.807,It's very important and historic that we passed that.,146,,
661,0.97,3944.807,3953.883,"But and this is going to the voters so in that sense yes, the Council is not making the decision.",146,,
662,0.97,3953.883,3955.785,It's leaving it to the voters.,146,,
663,0.97,3955.785,3964.794,"But at the same time, it's not true that we don't know where the voters stand on Regressive taxation.",146,,
664,0.97,3964.794,3967.096,Absolutely there's no mystery about this.,146,,
665,0.97,3967.096,3969.765,"Our polls, and we don't need polls.",146,,
666,0.97,3969.765,3975.805,"Working people, the poor, the middle class are completely exhausted.",146,,
667,0.97,3975.805,3983.579,They're Fed up and angry about the Regressive taxation.,146,,
668,0.97,3983.579,3991.62,But also middle class people in Seattle are Fed up with property taxes and correctly so.,146,,
669,0.97,3991.62,3995.624,It's not exactly a progressive tax.,146,,
670,0.97,3995.624,3997.193,You can debate.,146,,
671,0.97,3997.193,4006.135,But the property taxes hit working class and middle class homeowners disproportionately.,146,,
672,0.97,4006.135,4011.841,We are seeing the black home ownership being hit hard from property taxes.,146,,
673,0.97,4011.841,4018.447,"Over the years, and so voters are completely tired of Regressive taxation.",146,,
674,0.97,4018.447,4021.25,I just wanted to make my point.,146,,
675,0.97,4021.25,4023.452,Not speaking for anyone else on the Council.,146,,
676,0.97,4023.452,4035.064,I don't think it makes it okay just because we're sending it to the voters.,146,,
677,0.97,4035.064,4043.672,"And immediately, right at this moment, it's clear we don't have options.",146,,
678,0.97,4043.672,4052.448,"But that being said, not everybody of us was here on the previous councils and before I got on the Council this has been happening.",146,,
679,0.97,4052.448,4059.054,Where the city Council and the city establishment refused to push for Regressive revenues.,146,,
680,0.97,4059.054,4067.163,"I just wanted to make it clear that just because the voters will be voting on it, it won't be okay.",146,,
681,0.97,4067.163,4069.131,And voters care about the services.,146,,
682,0.97,4069.131,4074.57,"And when they are left with no options but to tax themselves, they will do it.",146,,
683,0.97,4074.57,4077.506,And what that speaks to is their commitment.,146,,
684,0.97,4077.506,4082.411,It's a commitment of ordinary people in Seattle to do the right thing.,146,,
685,0.97,4082.411,4088.684,But that doesn't absolve the city establishment of doing what we have the power to do.,146,,
686,0.97,4088.684,4091.554,We should do more of it.,146,,
687,0.97,4091.554,4096.225,And that's why amendment 6a is important.,146,,
688,0.97,4096.225,4098.894,Thank you.,147,,
689,0.97,4098.894,4100.996,"Thank you, Councilmember.",147,,
690,0.97,4100.996,4104.834,I think the transit advisory board Cochair is available.,147,,
691,0.97,4104.834,4106.335,I'll give her 30 seconds.,147,,
692,0.97,4106.335,4117.813,Erin if you want to speak quickly about the 6 year ration natural rational.,147,,
693,0.97,4117.813,4121.35,Thank you for the opportunity.,148,,
694,0.97,4121.35,4132.428,The reason we support a 6 year measure is because 2024 is going to be crowded with transit measures.,148,,
695,0.97,4132.428,4135.464,A possible King County transit measure.,148,,
696,0.97,4135.464,4144.473,And with trying to decide between a city versus a county measure this year was I think really took up a lot of our time.,148,,
697,0.97,4144.473,4165.394,"So especially with the possibility of a second transit measure, or by voters for car tabs, I think that is what makes us comfortable with going for a 6 year measure knowing that there's a possibility of a second revenue stream in the future.",148,,
698,0.97,4165.394,4168.464,Thank you.,149,,

701,0.97,4172.101,4189.218,"As per your request for a 5 year compromise, I would be inclined not to support that simply because I think it's important to keep these ballot measures on years where we have active voter participation.",150,,
702,0.97,4189.218,4192.521,Either 4 years or 6 years.,150,,
703,0.97,4192.521,4200.029,"Again, it's very difficult to make these decisions with so many unknowns before us.",150,,
704,0.97,4200.029,4206.936,"Each week, another level of crisis has unfolded and we're talking 4 to 6 years from now.",150,,
705,0.97,4206.936,4230.96,"I think that this is also in this conversation, should be held not inside of a vacuum but in tandem with Councilmember Morales' other amendments to increase the sales tax because these are both complementary conversations and interconnected.",150,,
706,0.97,4230.96,4242.938,I am still leans towards the 6 years because of the about for the regional measure to be passed at 4 years.,150,,
707,0.97,4242.938,4244.74,As per the comments.,150,,
708,0.97,4244.74,4247.343,I'm pretty torn on this.,150,,

710,0.97,4251.08,4252.247,Thank you.,151,,

713,0.97,4263.092,4270.766,And let us see where we land and I'm going to urge my colleagues support for this.,152,,
714,0.97,4270.899,4282.211,"Thank you, Councilmember Morales, sponsor.",153,,

722,0.97,4320.149,4320.716,It's 0.1.,157,,
723,0.97,4320.716,4325.654,And we have a second additional revenue stream in 4 years hopefully.,157,,

751,0.97,4399.094,4409.738,The idea with amendment 4 is that again we heard the calls for more transit to have and to protect transit as part of this.,179,,
752,0.97,4409.738,4419.081,So what this does is it simply says that a majority of the yearly expenditures must be for transit.,179,,
753,0.97,4419.081,4425.621,And that sections 2A and 2 B of the measure are the 2 big transit pieces.,179,,

795,0.97,4556.585,4561.156,Amendment number 5 is sponsored by Councilmember Herbold.,206,,
796,0.97,4561.156,4571.9,It identifies the transit usage goals that necessary to manage congestion related to the West Seattle bridge closure.,207,,
797,0.97,4571.9,4580.609,And REVISES to include Metro routes serving low income in Seattle.,207,,
798,0.97,4580.609,4581.209,Councilmember Herbold.,208,,
799,0.97,4581.209,4585.18,Thank you.,209,,
800,0.97,4585.18,4599.494,"So as Cal described, this amendment both identifies the transit goal shift that Sdot has for West Seattle.",209,,
801,0.97,4599.494,4614.142,There are no number of Detour routes that will be able to carry the same volume of vehicles that we saw before the West Seattle bridge closure.,209,,
802,0.97,4614.142,4639.334,"And that means it is very, very important for people who can do so to move out of single occupancy vehicles into transit, and from 17% currently or Pre-Covid-19 rate to 30%.",209,,
803,0.97,4639.334,4661.79,The other part of this amendment section 2A I've heard a lot of frustration from communities in district 1 that have the lowest income and are frustrated because they are the Furthest to the South and on the border of the city.,209,,
804,0.97,4661.79,4665.494,"And those neighborhoods include South Park, Highlands park.",209,,
805,0.97,4665.494,4672.167,Routes currently that serve these neighborhoods don't meet the criteria because they are close to the border of the city.,209,,
806,0.97,4672.167,4676.505,And in part to routing decisions made by King County Metro.,209,,
807,0.97,4676.505,4683.512,People in these neighborhoods have regularly expressed discontent that they are not well served.,209,,
808,0.97,4683.512,4689.985,They are aware of it every time a service modification comes up.,209,,
809,0.97,4689.985,4699.628,"It's clear that they are unlikely to get additional service because of not meeting this threshold of, in Seattle.",209,,
810,0.97,4699.628,4709.638,And I think it's really important to recognize this discontent when we're discussing a ballot measure that has to be approved by voters.,209,,
811,0.97,4709.638,4719.147,And I asked Sdot for information about what routes don't meet the 65% criteria.,209,,
812,0.97,4719.147,4727.556,"And in addition to 3 routes in Highlands Park, 1 route in South Park, there are also two routes.",209,,
813,0.97,4727.556,4732.661,The route 312 and the 330 in Lake City that would meet this criteria.,209,,
814,0.97,4732.661,4748.977,"Just to clarify, it would not require the city to provide funding but it would create an option for the city to fund these additional routes.",209,,
815,0.97,4748.977,4749.945,Thank you.,209,,
816,0.97,4749.945,4761.389,Any comments or questions on amendment number 5? okay.,210,,

875,0.97,5025.787,5031.559,And I don't know that I see them as mutually exclusive.,242,,
876,0.97,5031.559,5043.671,"As many have said today and also in the past, in public testimonials and other forums.",242,,
877,0.97,5043.671,5050.278,We are faced with a choice of Regressive taxes.,242,,
878,0.97,5050.278,5060.588,There's no reason why any Council at any given moment can't do something better.,242,,
879,0.97,5060.588,5065.593,Last year.,242,,
880,0.97,5065.593,5091.619,"Through O'Brien's transportation Committee, we worked on--this is what they will do.",242,,
881,0.97,5091.619,5099.027,They will try to jam up the process at every step of the way and that is an anticipated occurrence.,242,,
882,0.97,5099.027,5112.64,"And so that happened and last fall, the hearing Examiner, ruled that the Council needed to do more work.",242,,
883,0.97,5112.64,5123.351,"And Unfortunately, this year, the transportation committee under Councilmember Pedersen has not carried out the work on.",242,,
884,0.97,5123.351,5131.159,"At this point, and also this was relayed at the budget committee last week.",242,,
885,0.97,5131.159,5137.565,"At this point, the earliest we could, would be in 2021.",242,,
886,0.97,5137.565,5156.818,"To make that actually happen, the city council needs to make a very clear statement today in what gets voted on that we intend to do that work and have, and make it clear that a fee on corporate developers.",242,,
887,0.97,5156.818,5159.654,This amendment 6a adds to make that commitment.,242,,
888,0.97,5159.654,5167.562,I just wanted to quickly read out the whereas clauses to let members of the public know what this stands for.,242,,
889,0.97,5167.562,5188.216,"Whereas that my office is proposing to add are whereas sales tax and legal license fees are Regressive fees that Disproportion Gnatly burden, especially communities of color.",242,,
890,0.97,5188.216,5212.207,"Fees could be established as early as 2021 to increase funding to buy bus service hours and developer, paid for by large corporate developers, Úand whereas the Seattle city council intends to complete in 2020 to unable developer impact fees to be enacted in 2021.",242,,
891,0.97,5212.207,5226.12,"And the Seattle city council is committed to, to race no less than $44 million which would allow Seattle to increase funding for Metro bus hours.",242,,
892,0.97,5226.12,5244.672,"So as I said, 6a and B are driving towards similar things but not exactly . 6a acknowledges that, 6 B does not.",242,,
893,0.97,5244.672,5254.482,6a says that the Council commits to enact.,242,,
894,0.97,5254.482,5259.454,And intends to consider impact fees.,242,,
895,0.97,5259.454,5265.526,"And importantly, 6 B, 6a commits $44 million and 6 B does not make that commitment.",242,,
896,0.97,5265.66,5276.504,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant.",243,,
897,0.97,5276.504,5278.273,Councilmember Herbold.,244,,
898,0.97,5278.273,5288.116,I actually have a question with Councilmember Sawant's version of the amendment as it relates to the last recital.,245,,
899,0.97,5288.116,5296.891,It suggests that the funding associated with developer impact fees could be used to increase funding for services.,245,,
900,0.97,5296.891,5309.137,And developer impact fees developed under the growth management act through are restricted to capital costs.,245,,
901,0.97,5309.137,5312.44,Not for operational costs.,245,,
902,0.97,5312.44,5319.213,And I'm mostly interested in the $44 million number.,245,,
903,0.97,5319.213,5337.065,I too worked with Councilmember O'Brien on the transportation impact fee proposal that he was working on along with a lot of community Stakeholders such as the air Club on developing a proposal that was appealed last year.,245,,
904,0.97,5337.065,5348.376,And there's a project list developed and a fee level developed.,245,,
905,0.97,5348.376,5364.759,"And we're in conversations with Councilmember, I'm sorry, central staffer Freeman to talk about how to resurrect that project list and update it so we can begin the process again.",245,,
906,0.97,5364.759,5380.074,But I don't know that $44 million number cores with the fee rate and estimates on what those fees could raise in that work that has already been done.,245,,
907,0.97,5380.074,5393.354,"I don't want to undo that work because again, it's got a project list and a fee rate that corresponds to that, the cost associated with that project rate.",245,,
908,0.97,5393.354,5397.525,"Councilmember, if I may just Interject a little bit.",246,,
909,0.97,5397.525,5403.631,There are 2 different authorities for imposing transportation impact fees.,246,,
910,0.97,5403.631,5411.339,There's the authority which you are describing which is limited to capital which would support capacity needs to support that development.,246,,
911,0.97,5411.339,5416.844,That's the link to the growth management act.,246,,
912,0.97,5416.844,5422.25,Under that scenario.,246,,
913,0.97,5422.25,5426.854,You couldn't spend Transportationimpact fees on.,246,,
914,0.97,5426.854,5434.562,To impose impact fees and those appear less restrictive.,246,,
915,0.97,5434.562,5439.033,It appears it could be used more broadly for transportation purposes.,246,,
916,0.97,5439.033,5444.972,But it would have to tie back to the development and the charge of the fee.,246,,
917,0.97,5444.972,5446.874,But there's less precedent about what that means.,246,,
918,0.97,5446.874,5465.593,And I was assuming that this amendment was focused on the growth management act framework for passing developer impact fees.,247,,
919,0.97,5465.593,5479.373,Seattle city council intends to complete in 2020 any fee analysis to enable developer impact fees.,247,,
920,0.97,5479.373,5482.51,I think it may speak to both.,248,,
921,0.97,5482.51,5491.619,"Because we don't really have precedent to follow in terms of what the transportation benefit authority would look like, I think our central staff's interpretation.",248,,
922,0.97,5491.619,5501.896,"I think we expect that's likely to follow a lot of the same procedures, including environmental review.",248,,
923,0.97,5501.896,5502.43,Councilmember Lewis.,249,,
924,0.97,5502.43,5506.501,"I just want to ask a few more questions, Calvin.",250,,
925,0.97,5506.501,5522.717,"And I know there was some material distributed contrasting the 2 potential authorities, the growth management act versus the path on impact fees.",250,,
926,0.97,5522.717,5527.121,And for the benefit of the public.,250,,
927,0.97,5527.121,5537.465,My understanding is that the Gma impact fees are fairly constrained not only on capital expenses but in enhancing capacity.,250,,
928,0.97,5537.465,5541.769,You couldn't use it to kind of do a replacement of a street.,250,,
929,0.97,5541.769,5546.374,It would be more about expanding a street for example.,250,,
930,0.97,5546.374,5551.178,So I wonder when you talk about flexibility.,250,,
931,0.97,5551.178,5562.99,Is there more flexibility in the transportation benefit version where it could be used for replacing infrastructure rather than enhancing infrastructure.,250,,
932,0.97,5562.99,5571.465,And the second question would be do we have to pursue the same sort of voter approval path that we're pursuing now for the sales tax?,250,,
933,0.97,5571.465,5575.836,Or could we approve the fees?,250,,
934,0.97,5575.836,5582.31,Or would it require a sup from time to Timal vote for the impact fee.,250,,
935,0.97,5582.31,5583.744,Those are my 2 questions.,250,,
936,0.97,5583.744,5589.05,I'll take it in reverse order.,251,,
937,0.97,5589.05,5597.625,A under either authority do not require voter approval.,252,,
938,0.97,5597.625,5606.634,"I think the, we have cleared case law and clarity in growth management act that those would have to be capacity improvements.",252,,
939,0.97,5606.634,5618.746,"They have to, can't be used to deal with Pre-Existing maintenance problems or Pre- existing conditions.",252,,
940,0.97,5618.746,5621.515,It has to serve.,253,,
941,0.97,5621.515,5623.951,Under the transportation benefit distribution you can it's less clear.,253,,
942,0.97,5623.951,5629.023,It can be used for transportation purposes.,253,,
943,0.97,5629.023,5633.861,That is not necessarily requires to be tied to capacity.,253,,
944,0.97,5633.861,5659.387,"The districts have been used to fund roads, public transportation, transportation and, operations and maintenance, so we think that it is still used for those resources.",253,,
945,0.97,5664.258,5664.759,[Captioners Transitioning],253,,
946,0.97,5665.059,5690.718,There's a certain amount of connection we want to understand about the spending.,254,,
947,0.97,5690.718,5693.187,But it appears to be more expansive.,254,,
948,0.97,5693.187,5701.629,"If there are services or facilities that more broadly support that work, I think.",254,,
949,0.97,5701.629,5706.167,But that's part of what our environmental work and,254,,
950,0.97,5720.081,5730.191,I am not familiar with how the benefit impact fee case a ghost but that's my interpretation.,255,,
951,0.97,5730.191,5739.867,It is included as one of several allowed for the transportation benefit.,255,,
952,0.97,5739.867,5744.472,For the purpose of the transportation benefits spending those are laid out in state law.,255,,
953,0.97,5744.472,5750.478,I think our question is more tied to the other restrictions on fees and how they have to be interpreted.,255,,
954,0.97,5750.478,5758.786,"Again, we don't have any precedent to evaluate what that means.",255,,
955,0.97,5758.786,5766.527,But in terms of what is on the books we think we could spend it on the same things that the transformation transportation district could in general.,255,,
956,0.97,5766.527,5776.904,Let's go to more Alice and then we can in with Councilmember more Alice.,256,,
957,0.97,5776.904,5785.179,Maybe it will help if it clarifies something and then I can close.,257,,
958,0.97,5785.179,5792.119,"Okay, I Councilmember Morales nodding.",258,,
959,0.97,5792.119,5816.043,"I want to introduce and put this in because because obviously there are two types of impact fees, transportation to restrict transportation district 4 growth management act.",258,,
960,0.97,5816.043,5821.949,It is not meant to be which legal type of impact fees is considered for all of the reasons that Calvin said.,258,,
961,0.97,5821.949,5844.038,Our understanding is that a similar process will have to be used and of course as was clarified with the transportation benefit [Indiscernible] but the management act need to be used as was clarified but there's nothing stopping the counsel from equal amounts of other funds for transit.,258,,
962,0.97,5844.038,5851.178,There is no legal issue at all but is just how we adjust our funds with adjustment hours.,258,,
963,0.97,5851.178,5858.953,The city uses many types of transit funds for capacity and those funds can be used for transit.,258,,
964,0.97,5858.953,5883.777,"As far as what concerns may be, the previous work done for the analysis which hit the road block, the analysis requires a plan and last year the plan was for $30 million and it was used but my understanding is that that could be adjusted easily without undoing any of the work.",258,,
965,0.97,5883.777,5892.353,When we put the amendment forward in my office we clarified that would not be included in the previous work.,258,,
966,0.97,5892.353,5905.132,"It is to explain why $34 million is the minimum that needs to be raised, for that which is posed in front of us.",258,,
967,0.97,5905.132,5907.501,Thank you for answering my question from before.,259,,
968,0.97,5907.501,5916.11,Councilmember do you have a comment or question?,260,,
969,0.97,5916.11,5920.481,Maybe I am being dense but I am trying to make sure that I understand.,261,,
970,0.97,5920.481,5921.916,I need some clarity in the language itself.,261,,
971,0.97,5921.916,5929.056,It says impact fees of 2021 to raise not less than 44 million.,261,,
972,0.97,5929.056,5935.93,Does that mean the intent is only to reset in 2021 as a stopgap or is the intent that it would be ongoing?,261,,
973,0.97,5935.93,5940.968,I am just not sure I'm reading this quite the right way.,261,,
974,0.97,5940.968,5941.969,Ongoing is the intent.,262,,
975,0.97,5941.969,5948.943,It's like the floor that needs to be raised.,262,,
976,0.97,5948.943,5954.248,The intent is ongoing.,262,,
977,0.97,5954.248,5957.051,"Councilmember, if I may add that these are statements of intent.",263,,
978,0.97,5957.051,5975.302,I think the actual--one of the things that does differentiate the transmission impact fees from the sales tax is that it follows the development cycle and a lot of those types of questions about how much money is available will change over the course of time.,263,,
979,0.97,5975.302,5981.208,That is inherent in the type of source being contemplated.,263,,
980,0.97,5981.208,5982.242,"I'm sorry, one more thing.",264,,
981,0.97,5982.242,5993.287,"I appreciate that, and it is a less reliable source because of that . Although I do support it, but I want to be clear about that",264,,
982,0.97,5993.287,6000.361,"To know that you support those, we will talk to you later about that.",265,,
983,0.97,6000.361,6001.028,Thank you.,265,,
984,0.97,6001.028,6002.73,Councilmember Lewis.,266,,
985,0.97,6002.73,6008.168,"I'm sorry, I was muted.",267,,
986,0.97,6008.168,6020.314,"I have one last question, Calvin and I am reviewing your memo again while I have you here and since we are having this discussion, if there is any last thing.",267,,
987,0.97,6020.314,6028.756,"I noticed in the chart comparing and contrasting the two different, Gma and transportation benefit district.",267,,
988,0.97,6028.756,6031.024,There are limits in the types of development that can be levied.,267,,
989,0.97,6031.024,6043.37,"There at three types for the development, commercial, residential and commercial with more than 19 units but Gma has no legal number of units.",267,,
990,0.97,6043.37,6077.704,"Is it possible to mix and match into going to both authorities, and maybe have some impact fee authority that could go toward the broader scope of the Gma for those capacity improvements and levied the transportation benefit district impact fees to be broader applied but to a narrower group type of development? or is that a question we should ask the city attorney's office later, but I am curious about your take.",267,,
991,0.97,6077.704,6088.882,"We do a little bit different on each authority depending on the scope for the tax fee base, and also the scope of what they can be used for?",267,,
992,0.97,6088.882,6097.424,My understanding is that there could be separate fees imposed but the developer would have to be credited against both fees or charges paid.,268,,
993,0.97,6097.424,6110.404,"So the developer that had to pay for the growth impact fee, that same charge would be counted against his payment for the transportation benefit district the.",268,,
994,0.97,6110.404,6117.311,"It is somewhat shared authority in terms of our boundaries, but I am not really the expert on the transportation benefit they.",268,,
995,0.97,6117.311,6130.524,I think that there may be information about that and the city attorney would probably be the best source for that as well.,268,,
996,0.97,6130.524,6131.558,Thank you for that clarification.,269,,
997,0.97,6131.558,6148.375,"It seems to me that, especially given your answer just now too, and I know this is not necessarily the issue in front of us but I want to get this out because I know Councilmember Peterson and central staff are thinking about this.",269,,
998,0.97,6148.375,6163.59,If we were to impose both you could cast a bigger net on making sure that you are not just relying on that narrower transit benefit district authorities so that seems like a conversation we will need to have too.,269,,
999,0.97,6163.59,6180.307,"Thank you Councilmember Lewis and Council members, I think we can call the question but if you want the fir tree word and before the Councilmember closes out on this, did you want to talk about the be?",270,,
1000,0.97,6180.307,6181.241,Absolutely.,271,,
1001,0.97,6181.241,6192.085,I am indicating my intention to vote for both versions but I don't see these as mutually exclusive.,271,,
1002,0.97,6192.085,6205.465,"For the Council members that might believe that there is one version better than the other, I want to vote for both and I want to make sure that one of them passes but I do not believe they are mutually exclusive.",271,,
1003,0.97,6205.465,6205.799,Thank you.,271,,
1004,0.97,6205.799,6216.109,Thank you Councilmember Herbold.,272,,
1005,0.97,6216.109,6218.579,And we will close it out with Councilmember Sewant.,272,,
1006,0.97,6218.579,6224.251,I will but with the Councilmember as well.,273,,
1007,0.97,6224.251,6227.387,"Councilmember, Sewant, take us home.",274,,
1008,0.97,6227.387,6232.259,Thank you.,275,,
1009,0.97,6232.259,6238.298,It is the very last clause but it's important that we as a Council state our intent for what we Wantto do in the future and that is important.,275,,
1010,0.97,6238.298,6257.05,"As I have said before and I agree with what the Councilmember just said is that I don't see that as a mutually exclusive either but by that measure for Council members that support the votes, I hope you both yes on 6 letter a as well.",275,,
1011,0.97,6257.05,6261.088,Thank you Councilmember Sewant.,276,,
1012,0.97,6261.088,6267.794,Will the clerk called the roll on adoption member 6a.,277,,
1013,0.97,6267.794,6276.837,[rollcall],278,,
1014,0.97,6294.554,6299.726,Seven in favor and one opposed.,279,,
1015,0.97,6299.726,6306.833,"Thank you, the motion carries and 6a is adopted.",280,,
1016,0.97,6306.833,6314.541,Let's move the amendment for 6B and then we can address that.,281,,
1017,0.97,6314.541,6317.377,For two approved the amendment.,281,,
1018,0.97,6317.377,6318.645,Second.,282,,
1019,0.97,6318.645,6322.849,Thank you.,283,,
1020,0.97,6322.849,6323.75,"6B,",283,,
1021,0.97,6323.75,6334.027,There were multiple Council members interested in exploring this source of revenue.,284,,
1022,0.97,6334.027,6338.065,That is for the real estate developer impact fees.,284,,
1023,0.97,6338.065,6339.9,These are just recitals in the measure.,284,,
1024,0.97,6339.9,6347.04,They are signaling Attent intent and interest in this.,284,,
1025,0.97,6347.04,6360.754,There are other fees that real estate developers pay Likethe management housing developer fees they pay and there is an interest in looking at what the levels are charged to developers for the Mha fees.,284,,
1026,0.97,6360.754,6380.574,"We have this authority under the state law, under two different sections of the Rcw . One is for the transportation benefit district impact fees into the for the growth management act impact fees with different pros and cons of the limitations.",284,,
1027,0.97,6380.574,6383.009,We definitely want to explore this.,284,,
1028,0.97,6383.009,6393.453,The reason we drafted 6B is that in its sights specifically two different authorities.,284,,
1029,0.97,6393.453,6402.195,It says we intend on considering imposing transportation back fees which could fund necessary capital and other transportation investment.,284,,
1030,0.97,6402.195,6405.132,That supports transit capacity.,284,,
1031,0.97,6405.132,6414.508,"Councilmember Herbold do you want to add to this in a more eloquent fashion, hopefully.",284,,
1032,0.97,6414.508,6426.286,Not more eloquent but an additional fine point is that this amendment is very explicit about the two different types of developer impact fees.,285,,
1033,0.97,6426.286,6440.066,It would address any lack of clarity in the previous amendment about which developer impact fees for the transportation phase we are talking about.,285,,
1034,0.97,6440.066,6445.739,If this one very clearly identifies the authorizing statutes for both.,285,,
1035,0.97,6445.739,6452.479,I think that is probably the benefit of including this along with the previously approved amendment.,285,,
1036,0.97,6452.479,6458.585,Thank you Councilmember Herbold.,286,,
1037,0.97,6458.585,6462.456,Any questions or comments about the final on 6B.,286,,
1038,0.97,6462.456,6469.062,Councilmember Sewant.,287,,
1039,0.97,6469.062,6473.8,I want to note that while I will be voting yes on this but I have concerns about the overall concept.,288,,
1040,0.97,6473.8,6486.213,"Given that this is an advisory, and the whereas clauses are in the recitals, I will be voting yesterday but I wanted to signal that.",288,,
1041,0.97,6486.213,6491.017,As the conversation moves forward I will have significant questions about the policy in impact that we will be looking for.,288,,
1042,0.97,6491.017,6491.384,Thank you.,289,,
1043,0.97,6491.384,6493.92,Councilmember Strauss.,290,,
1044,0.97,6493.92,6518.445,I just want to echo the comments just made and I think that the impact fees are important and need to be right sized with the neighboring jurisdictions and we are looking at the overall amount of fees and generally I believe this is an option.,291,,
1045,0.97,6518.445,6524.15,"These are whereas clauses which is why I voted in favor of the amendments, and putting on the record that I do believe they need to be right sized.",291,,
1046,0.97,6524.15,6525.552,Thank you Councilmember Strauss.,292,,
1047,0.97,6525.552,6531.758,"If there are no further comments or questions on amendment 6B, will the clerk please call the role and adoption on amendment 6B.",293,,
1048,0.97,6535.795,6539.9,[rollcall],293,,
1049,0.97,6553.313,6568.461,Eight in favor and Unopposed.,294,,
1050,0.97,6568.461,6568.795,Thank you.,295,,
1051,0.97,6568.795,6570.263,The motion carries an amendment 6B is also adopted.,295,,
1052,0.97,6570.263,6571.698,Let's go on to amendment 7.,296,,
1053,0.97,6571.698,6575.302,I think we want to move and second this and then we will have Calvin address it.,296,,
1054,0.97,6575.302,6577.804,Councilmember Morales would you like to move amendment 7 of counsel bill 11983?,296,,
1055,0.97,6577.804,6579.205,I moved the amendment.,297,,
1056,0.97,6579.205,6584.911,Great.,298,,
1057,0.97,6584.911,6589.783,Amendment 7 to amend 119833 has been moved and is there a second?,298,,
1058,0.97,6589.783,6590.85,I will second it.,299,,
1059,0.97,6590.85,6599.326,All right.,299,,
1060,0.97,6599.326,6602.862,"Calvin, do you want to give us a summary and the sponsor can talk about it.",300,,
1061,0.97,6602.862,6604.864,Absolutely.,301,,
1062,0.97,6604.864,6613.34,Amendment 7 as the whereas clause describing the city intent for the social justice analysis to inform spending decisions as we move forward.,301,,
1063,0.97,6613.34,6615.408,"But thank you, Councilmember Morales.",301,,
1064,0.97,6615.408,6625.752,And my Unmuted.,302,,
1065,0.97,6627.22,6627.454,"I am, okay.",302,,
1066,0.97,6627.454,6628.321,"Thank you, Calvin.",302,,
1067,0.97,6628.321,6643.37,I don't think there is a lot more to say about this except that we always want to make sure we are centering with racial equity and this amendment with the whereas clause does clarify that Sdot would use the racial social injustice analysis.,302,,
1068,0.97,6643.37,6655.982,I want to mention this is in keeping with King County mobility equity framework so that we are making sure that there is that kind of analysis done when we are looking at how the funds get spent.,302,,
1069,0.97,6655.982,6666.559,"We make sure that those, somebody said earlier the institutional Guardrails are in place that we protect as much service as possible to our communities of color.",302,,
1070,0.97,6666.559,6667.594,Thank you.,302,,
1071,0.97,6667.594,6677.17,"Thank you, Councilmember Morales and for enabling me to cosponsor this with you.",303,,
1072,0.97,6677.17,6681.508,Any comments or questions about amendment 7? okay.,303,,
1073,0.97,6681.508,6687.347,"Say no comments or questions on amendment 7, will the clerk please call the role roll.",303,,
1074,0.97,6706.433,6708.802,[rollcall],303,,
1075,0.97,6708.802,6713.94,Eight in favor and Unopposed.,304,,
1076,0.97,6713.94,6716.543,Great.,305,,
1077,0.97,6716.543,6718.812,It carries and the amendment is adopted.,305,,
1078,0.97,6718.812,6726.252,Those are the members on the agenda and Councilmember added amendment 8 and this is a big one.,306,,
1079,0.97,6726.252,6736.463,"Calvin, sharing his screen with everybody and this is locked on so everybody can see what it does.",306,,
1080,0.97,6736.463,6744.304,Councilmember Morales would you like to move to amend counsel bill as presented on amendment 8?,306,,
1081,0.97,6744.304,6745.371,So moved.,307,,
1082,0.97,6745.371,6748.241,Is there a second?,308,,
1083,0.97,6748.241,6754.28,Second.,309,,
1084,0.97,6754.28,6755.148,Okay.,310,,
1085,0.97,6755.148,6755.982,Has been moved and Seconded.,310,,
1086,0.97,6755.982,6758.585,Let's hear from Calvin and we can hear from the sponsor.,310,,
1087,0.97,6758.585,6766.893,It is 11:53.,310,,
1088,0.97,6766.893,6768.495,I know this is a really big amendment.,310,,
1089,0.97,6768.495,6777.337,"I asked the Council members to be patient as we talked through this amendment, and then we can potentially both our measure out of committee today.",310,,
1090,0.97,6777.337,6785.078,"Mr. judges, if I could briefly say was this amendment sent to us and I want to see if I can also follow along in our computers.",311,,
1091,0.97,6785.078,6792.318,"That question is for the chair, sponsor.",311,,
1092,0.97,6792.318,6794.721,I do not know the answer to that.,312,,
1093,0.97,6794.721,6803.696,"We sent it to the chair but I'm happy to send it right now to the rest of the folks, and I apologize.",312,,
1094,0.97,6803.696,6804.497,Thank you for doing that.,313,,
1095,0.97,6804.497,6808.334,I will summarize the amendment.,314,,
1096,0.97,6808.334,6824.217,It is pretty concise and it would change the sales tax rate from 1/10 of 1% and raise it to 2/10 of 1% and makes the changes in section 1 that is shown here and makes the changes in the ballot title of section V shown here.,314,,
1097,0.97,6824.217,6829.656,It is quiet to the point.,314,,
1098,0.97,6829.656,6830.657,Okay.,315,,
1099,0.97,6830.657,6842.402,Councilmember Morales would you like to speak to this amendment? I'm having trouble seeing everybody space is now.,315,,
1100,0.97,6842.402,6845.738,"Yes, thank you.",316,,
1101,0.97,6845.738,6850.643,"Thank you chair, thank you Calvin.",316,,
1102,0.97,6850.643,6859.152,The first thing I need to do is acknowledge that this was sent--I asked Calvin to drop this at 8:00 this morning.,316,,
1103,0.97,6859.152,6867.06,I want to apologize to everyone for the very late notice.,316,,
1104,0.97,6867.06,6873.199,I think it is an indicator of how much I think all of us have probably been struggling with this measure.,316,,
1105,0.97,6873.199,6885.278,"You know, I want to acknowledge the very strong preference that this counsel has demonstrated for Progressive options for how we provide service to our community.",316,,
1106,0.97,6885.278,6891.818,I think we have all been struggling with how to address the service cuts.,316,,
1107,0.97,6891.818,6911.871,"I really only asked for this amendment after many discussions over the last couple of weeks with advocates, with the transit transportation planners, transit planners, and with admittedly a few of our communities of color organizations representing communities of color.",316,,
1108,0.97,6911.871,6913.406,It was not many as I would have liked.,316,,
1109,0.97,6913.406,6923.349,Part of the challenge here is that our state officials advise us to leave use--to use our local options first addressing transportation issues.,316,,
1110,0.97,6923.349,6936.162,But we know the cross city--cross city is into the jurisdictions which is part of what we are struggling with there.,316,,
1111,0.97,6936.162,6949.475,I want to acknowledge the need for racial equity and we are in a position of balancing the impact of household budgets with the real threat of [Indiscernible] that need it most.,316,,
1112,0.97,6949.475,6957.45,"Very candidly, that is why this amendment came in so late.",316,,
1113,0.97,6957.45,6961.087,I couldn't--I think we are all struggling with what to do with this.,316,,
1114,0.97,6961.087,6977.704,"I want to say that the very short Timeline for getting this passed, as Councilmember Strauss has Referenced a couple of times, it has really created a barrier and a challenge for us as a counsel.",316,,
1115,0.97,6977.704,6979.739,It created a barrier for the communities of color.,316,,
1116,0.97,6979.739,6991.05,The kind of rapid policy decision-making like this really reflects structural racism within our institutions.,316,,
1117,0.97,6991.05,6994.187,The advocacy groups that represent communities of color are accountable to their community members.,316,,
1118,0.97,6994.187,7002.929,"That means it takes them time to reach out and do have meaningful conversations with them, and to really understand what the impact on communities will be.",316,,
1119,0.97,7002.929,7015.808,And because we got this so quickly and were asked to make a decision so quickly we did not have the kind of time to do the real effective outreach that we would've liked.,316,,
1120,0.97,7015.808,7029.956,"That said, as I mentioned, I've spoken with several organizations and we know that--in my district, Chinatown- International district, it is the most impacted neighborhood because there's so many different transit projects that come through the community.",316,,
1121,0.97,7029.956,7041.734,And getting service for that community is deeply problematic.,316,,
1122,0.97,7041.734,7049.475,With that said the amendment is attempted to buy back as many hours as possible.,316,,
1123,0.97,7049.475,7055.148,"If we raised the rates we can buy over 100,000 hours of transit to prevent that kind of enormous cuts that we are looking at.",316,,
1124,0.97,7055.148,7061.054,I will say that it also helps some of our climate goals by facilitating a move away from the cars.,316,,
1125,0.97,7061.054,7074.6,We can really make sure that we have a little more ability to support communities of color who might be coming in from a little bit further South in Seattle.,316,,
1126,0.97,7074.6,7101.027,"But I really feel we need to do this, as hard as it is, especially as the Councilmember said, given the determination we've had in the last few weeks to pass aggressive revenue we have to do everything we can to maintain the routes to support low-wage workers and to preserve as much transit as possible, and that is why I'm offering this amendment.",316,,
1127,0.97,7101.027,7106.699,"Thank you, Councilmember Morales.",317,,
1128,0.97,7106.699,7107.967,Councilmember Lewis.,317,,
1129,0.97,7107.967,7118.945,Thank you Mr. chair and Councilmember Mary Alice--Morales for moving this forward.,318,,
1130,0.97,7118.945,7137.763,I don't think there's any better example of showing like the rock and a hard place that we are between in this really painful discussion where we have this massive falloff and cuts to the services of the transportation benefit district.,318,,
1131,0.97,7137.763,7156.182,"That is compounded by restrictions on our car tag authority, further compounded by a recession that is severely limiting the return from sales taxes that we've seen fall off the cliff because consuming is down.",318,,
1132,0.97,7156.182,7156.883,The economy is down.,318,,
1133,0.97,7156.883,7167.56,You know I would be--I would not be open with everyone here if I said I was not Conflicted about this.,318,,
1134,0.97,7167.56,7171.097,This is one of the few tools that we have.,318,,
1135,0.97,7171.097,7176.802,This could restore the inequity of the massive cuts that we are going to see in the benefit district.,318,,
1136,0.97,7176.802,7218.01,"I'm still going to bow no on this today because in balancing the inequity of the transit cuts, and balancing the inequity of increasing, you know, what would represent an increase in an already aggressive sales tax, I am Airing on the side of wanting to keep the sales tax where it is and my preference honestly would be to be in a position as a city to have more power to reduce the sales tax, and have a system where we could increase the progressive tax is.",318,,
1137,0.97,7218.01,7224.383,"I'm talking about the capital gains tax, and the Jumpstart tax that we had earlier, to use those taxes to pay down property taxes and sales taxes.",318,,
1138,0.97,7224.383,7232.258,I think it should be a long- term goal of this counsel . I just cannot get in the moment that we are in to increase the sales tax.,318,,
1139,0.97,7232.258,7271.063,"I am hopeful and the reason I voted for the four year limit earlier is that we will be in a position where when we get through a difficult four years, or even sooner, we will have progressive tools . We will have resolved the litigation with the car tabs and even have a position to get more revenue from the car tab portion although I do acknowledge and can see that the car tabs are a Regressive way to raise revenue.",318,,
1140,0.97,7271.063,7284.01,"I think given the pressure we are facing and given the massive regress 70 of our system, I cannot the vote to increase sales taxes at this time.",318,,
1141,0.97,7284.01,7289.715,Should this amendment passed I was still vigorously campaigned for the transportation benefit district.,318,,
1142,0.97,7289.715,7301.794,"I will put those concerns aside if that is the decision that this counsel makes but my preference would be to keep it at .1, full well knowing that either way on this for there are Regressive implications.",318,,
1143,0.97,7301.794,7304.33,It is very sobering.,318,,
1144,0.97,7304.33,7310.736,"Is back down--thank you, Councilmember Lewis.",318,,
1145,0.97,7310.736,7312.905,Councilmember Herbold.,319,,
1146,0.97,7312.905,7315.341,Thank you.,320,,
1147,0.97,7315.341,7319.845,I too am not going to support this man bent--amendment.,320,,
1148,0.97,7319.845,7341.1,"I cannot in good conscience increase our most aggressive tax during a recession . for a little bit of background from our previous recession, we did have a ballot measure on the ballot in 2008, the parks a ballot measure.",320,,
1149,0.97,7341.1,7366.959,"In the Council's wisdom at that point they actually, when you factored in inflation, the ballot measure was a little bit smaller than the one that was renewing in 2000 out of recognition of the uncertainty of the economic climate hat the city and country was in at the time.",320,,
1150,0.97,7366.959,7367.86,That measure passed.,320,,
1151,0.97,7367.86,7377.002,I don't want to do anything at all that risks the passage of this bill.,320,,
1152,0.97,7377.002,7380.406,We are lucky that we have a lot of transit use here in Seattle.,320,,
1153,0.97,7380.406,7384.21,But there are a lot of people that don't use Metro.,320,,
1154,0.97,7384.21,7397.623,"Those for the vote and I am really concerned that if we double the size of the sales tax on this measure, we could end up Regretting it.",320,,
1155,0.97,7397.623,7397.99,Thank you.,320,,
1156,0.97,7397.99,7404.33,Thank you Councilmember Herbold.,321,,
1157,0.97,7404.33,7408.534,I want to associate myself with the Councilmember Herbold comments.,322,,
1158,0.97,7408.534,7417.109,I share those concerns about doubling that sales tax during the recession . I am concerned it would impair the measure ultimately.,322,,
1159,0.97,7417.109,7444.837,"I want to restate my commitment that if we overturn 9976 that we will go right to those vehicle license fees, and have a discussion as a counsel about what the right sizes for those, and that we can apply those dollars to transit and other transit associated needs . This is a big deal to try to double it at this time . I will be voting no on the amendment.",322,,
1160,0.97,7444.837,7453.646,Councilmember Mosqueda.,323,,
1161,0.97,7453.646,7456.715,Thank you Mr. chair.,324,,
1162,0.97,7456.715,7472.765,I appreciate all the hard work you've done on this and I know that Councilmember Morales is struggling with the timing of it so it's hard to potentially make the vote on this today.,324,,
1163,0.97,7472.765,7499.391,"I am going to be abstaining on this today, mostly because I want additional Stakeholder input, or get additional feedback if I can, Councilmember Morales between now and Monday if this is being voted on, on Monday, is that correct question marks back it will be voted on, Monday, July 27, the current schedule with the August 4 deadline.",324,,
1164,0.97,7499.391,7499.658,Great.,325,,
1165,0.97,7499.658,7501.46,I will do additional work on my end to get additional payback.,325,,
1166,0.97,7501.46,7510.736,"As Councilmember Lewis said, it's very hard to know--I mean, it's hard to be torn on this because of the Regressive tools in our Toolbelt.",325,,
1167,0.97,7510.736,7525.484,"We know it is asking a lot of people but as stated earlier today this is exactly the time when we need people did not want have transit service and reductions in transit services, and credit Multimodal options so that people don't have to take their cars.",325,,
1168,0.97,7525.484,7544.67,"One of the people that testify this Moaning--this morning, exactly at when we should be reducing distance we will have potential more congested routes if we cut back on transit services.",325,,
1169,0.97,7544.67,7551.176,"I'm keeping that in mind as well, how do we make sure that we have the amount of funding needed, especially this time when we are asking people to safely distance.",325,,
1170,0.97,7551.176,7556.248,Today I will be abstaining and I will be seeking additional feedback in the meantime.,325,,
1171,0.97,7556.248,7564.189,Councilmember Strauss . & GT; & GT; thank you chair Pedersen.,326,,
1172,0.97,7564.189,7572.665,I will ask the bill sponsor because I feel I will likely be abstaining from this for.,326,,
1173,0.97,7572.665,7595.254,"I wonder if you want to hold this conversation until the--until we meet with full . My reason for abstaining, as you said you drafted it just this morning and I only heard about it verbally until we were able to receive it by Email a couple of minutes ago.",326,,
1174,0.97,7595.254,7596.355,This is a large-scale change.,326,,
1175,0.97,7596.355,7598.424,I just need a little bit more time.,326,,
1176,0.97,7598.424,7611.103,"As per my comments about the four year or six year, and I will let the committee know I have been advised by Amelia that I can reconsider amendment 3 and I will be discussing that in just a minute.",326,,
1177,0.97,7611.103,7615.608,Thank you Councilmember Sewant.,327,,
1178,0.97,7615.608,7632.625,As Councilmember Morales mentioned and as we said before the sales taxes are terribly Regressive taxes and puts the burden of funding transit on the poor and working-class people leaving the big business virtually Untaxed.,328,,
1179,0.97,7632.625,7655.981,But the business Council took a majority position on the taxes and taxes on big businesses and we know it can be done and we know there is tremendous support in the community for aggressive measures and people are tired of Regressive measures.,328,,
1180,0.97,7655.981,7661.186,We are facing a choice between increasing Regressive tax affecting those people of color and the poor communities.,328,,
1181,0.97,7661.186,7678.237,The most between that and having actual cuts or deep cuts to the bus hours which is not a real choice because working-class people lose either way.,328,,
1182,0.97,7678.237,7697.022,Not to mention if we allow the cuts to happened we will hit transit workers and members of 80 Aduyou 587--587 and they are among the most essential workers some of whom have given up their lives because they are providing this service and they are so dedicated in their work.,328,,
1183,0.97,7697.022,7716.508,Clearly what is at stake is really bad outcomes for our community and working across our community we don't want the different sections of the working class to be pitted against each other.,328,,
1184,0.97,7716.508,7725.05,"We want the taxes to be progressive in all transit jobs to be preserved, we want public service to be expanded and public sector jobs to be expanded.",328,,
1185,0.97,7725.05,7739.665,Legally it's not the only option of funding transit and the [Indiscernible] are construct with certain identifiable [Indiscernible] But there's nothing in the law to prevent the Council to use those funds paying for bus service.,328,,
1186,0.97,7739.665,7765.29,For example the city could pass an ordinance to increase the tax rate [Indiscernible] and increasing those tax rates by one quarter of a% would be sufficient to raise the funds to eliminate the transit budget cuts without any sales tax at all.,328,,
1187,0.97,7765.29,7768.894,The question is between now and Monday with Council members if they are able to support that.,328,,
1188,0.97,7768.894,7770.129,It is a viable and legal option.,328,,
1189,0.97,7770.129,7772.998,There's nothing illegal about increasing tax rate we just passed.,328,,
1190,0.97,7772.998,7791.717,"Another example is putting on the ballot the 1.27 increase with no taxes and while that does hit small businesses as well, and Unfortunately what we also need really is a change in the [Indiscernible] it is progressive and hits big business and not small businesses and yet it is less Regressive than the sales tax.",328,,
1191,0.97,7791.717,7793.418,It impacts much more progressive than the sales tax.,328,,
1192,0.97,7793.418,7802.427,Of course Mike preference would be to increase the Amazon tax rate.,328,,
1193,0.97,7802.427,7809.334,I did bring an amendment forward which did not go through that this is a real situation now that we are facing.,328,,
1194,0.97,7809.334,7818.41,"If Council members were to support any of those or either Progressive option rather than the Regressive sales taxes, then I would be happy to work on that and bring that forward.",328,,
1195,0.97,7818.41,7822.581,But failing that of course I don't know what other options that we have.,328,,
1196,0.97,7822.581,7829.288,I sear with Councilmember Morales on what she stressed on this.,328,,
1197,0.97,7829.288,7841.466,I would be abstaining on this I want to publicly state my serious willingness to work on them if there was any support on the Council to bring that forward by Monday.,328,,
1198,0.97,7841.466,7842.034,Thank you.,328,,
1199,0.97,7842.034,7852.978,"Thank you, Councilmember . I will recognize Councilmember Morales.",329,,
1200,0.97,7852.978,7855.647,One moment I want to alert the clerk is obviously paying close attention.,329,,
1201,0.97,7855.647,7876.602,"We will have questions for you about this amendment, as well as getting back to Councilmember Strauss' potential motion to reconsider a previous amendment but anticipating Councilmember Morales, go ahead Councilmember Morales.",329,,
1202,0.97,7876.602,7879.238,I want to again thank my colleagues for an opportunity to have this conversation.,330,,
1203,0.97,7879.238,7889.414,I do think it is important for us to consider how else we might be able to raise the revenue to buy additional service hours for our community.,330,,
1204,0.97,7889.414,7901.593,"With that in mind, given the number of people that said they were abstaining, I do think I want to withdraw the amendment and give us all a little bit more time to have a conversation, and he tried to understand what the best next step is.",330,,
1205,0.97,7901.593,7903.996,I will move to withdraw the amendment.,330,,
1206,0.97,7903.996,7908.634,Or whatever the motion.,330,,
1207,0.97,7908.634,7909.067,The conversation.,330,,
1208,0.97,7909.067,7912.738,That is a question for the clerk.,331,,
1209,0.97,7912.738,7917.276,Did you tell us the procedure?,331,,
1210,0.97,7917.276,7919.444,I believe it has been moved and Seconded.,331,,
1211,0.97,7919.444,7929.755,"What is the appropriate procedure, and is it possible also to vote on it today, and to have a discussion on the 27th about this topic?",331,,
1212,0.97,7929.755,7937.129,"Councilmember Pedersen, this is Amelia Sanchez.",332,,
1213,0.97,7937.129,7948.407,I would past and forward the motion to withdraw that motion which is proper and you can take it by a formal vote or unanimous consent.,332,,
1214,0.97,7948.407,7957.449,"In addition, if you prefer to vote on it and it were to fail it could be redressed again at the city council meeting.",332,,
1215,0.97,7957.449,7960.686,"Okay, so the motion to withdraw supersedes the original motion to introduce?",333,,
1216,0.97,7960.686,7969.394,At this point the motion before us is to withdraw the motion.,334,,
1217,0.97,7969.394,7982.007,"Once we photo that motion if it succeeds and we receive a majority in favor then at that point--if it doesn't succeed, excuse me, if you do not receive a majority in favor of the motion to withdraw than the motion is still before you.",334,,
1218,0.97,7982.007,7985.01,Okay.,335,,
1219,0.97,7985.01,7987.245,Councilmember Mosqueda.,335,,
1220,0.97,7987.245,8007.599,"It is a process question, Mr. chair . The similar question came up in the committee previously and if there is no objection to the motion to remove, or for the motion to withdraw the amendment, just by sheer fact there was no objection, is that unanimous consent?",336,,
1221,0.97,8007.599,8009.334,At this point the motion has been made.,337,,
1222,0.97,8009.334,8014.873,It is not--we have not asked for objection.,337,,
1223,0.97,8014.873,8022.981,"Once the chair moves to seek objections and if there is no objection then yes, we can move forward.",337,,
1224,0.97,8022.981,8023.749,Thank you.,338,,
1225,0.97,8023.749,8028.754,"That is a good question Councilmember Mosqueda and thank you clerk, for clarifying.",338,,
1226,0.97,8028.754,8037.062,For me the .2% has always been an option and is what the law allows.,338,,
1227,0.97,8037.062,8038.663,I believe that was in briefings from Sdot.,338,,
1228,0.97,8038.663,8044.77,The potential to go up to .2% from the central staff to go up 2.2%.,338,,
1229,0.97,8044.77,8063.422,"I am interested in potentially voting on it now and seeing what happens if Councilmember Morales, if the clerk can guide us how to, Councilmember Morales, to have that discussion again.",338,,
1230,0.97,8063.422,8079.704,"I think it is important for us to stay here, feelings on this amendment that was brought to us, and then see what the options are for continued discussion.",338,,
1231,0.97,8079.704,8082.24,"Councilmember Lewis, do you have a question or comment question mark",338,,
1232,0.97,8082.24,8088.613,"I mean we are discussing the motion, right?",339,,
1233,0.97,8088.613,8095.153,"Councilmember, are you objecting to the motion to withdrawal?",339,,
1234,0.97,8095.153,8096.288,"That's right, yes.",340,,
1235,0.97,8096.288,8096.922,Go-Ahead.,340,,
1236,0.97,8096.922,8097.255,I'm sorry.,341,,
1237,0.97,8097.255,8117.709,"I would then speak in favor of Councilmember Morales motion to withdrawal in the sense that I don't know, Councilmember Pedersen, as you stated whether we are going to get a good reflection on where we stand on this because three Councilmembers announced they would abstain.",341,,
1238,0.97,8117.709,8122.781,"If three of the eight members here are going to abstain on this for, I think it would be worth deferring the conversation.",341,,
1239,0.97,8122.781,8141.967,"I guess I'm just speaking in favor of--I will support Councilmember Morales motion to withdrawal, just given that I don't know that this will actually, truly reflect the sentiment of the Council, given that a third of the total membership has announced they would abstain at this point.",341,,
1240,0.97,8141.967,8144.269,That is unless they change their mind.,341,,
1241,0.97,8144.269,8147.672,"Thank you, Councilmember Lewis.",341,,
1242,0.97,8147.672,8176.835,"Councilmember Morales as a person that has chaired the most out of the last--is that your understanding, that it is prudent to go ahead and withdraw the motion and talk about it later and talk about it at the full council meeting?",342,,
1243,0.97,8186.077,8187.779,Sort of articulated there has three people are abstaining.,342,,
1244,0.97,8187.779,8195.32,It does not perhaps that's why you are suggesting moving in today.,342,,
1245,0.97,8195.32,8199.991,I think the first is the same.,342,,
1246,0.97,8199.991,8202.627,We would still have an entire week to hear back from Stakeholders.,342,,
1247,0.97,8202.627,8209.1,Have a chance to potentially hear more from central staff and so the effect is the same.,342,,
1248,0.97,8209.1,8223.548,Because it could still come back up as the clerk has noted for the Monday meeting following next Monday.,342,,
1249,0.97,8223.548,8225.35,I am inclined to agree.,343,,
1250,0.97,8225.35,8239.364,I want to note that Catherine Morales would like to withdraw her notion.,343,,
1251,0.97,8239.364,8240.365,A word to the wise.,343,,
1252,0.97,8240.365,8249.541,This is why it's difficult when you walk things on when we just got a copy of this 15 minutes ago.,343,,
1253,0.97,8249.541,8251.576,Is a major still switch in legislation to double the tax.,343,,
1254,0.97,8251.576,8254.412,I don't think you could have it both ways sometimes.,343,,
1255,0.97,8254.412,8255.58,You want it for four years.,343,,
1256,0.97,8255.58,8258.483,It's a sales tax and Regressive.,343,,
1257,0.97,8258.483,8259.484,And we want to double it.,343,,
1258,0.97,8259.484,8260.685,"Now, we just got it.",343,,
1259,0.97,8260.685,8270.962,I really think that we need to honor Councilman Morales's position to pull back her amendment.,343,,
1260,0.97,8270.962,8280.605,"However, I should add as well that we have been discussing the transportation benefit district before our last meeting on June 10.",343,,
1261,0.97,8280.605,8284.476,"This is pretty major, doubling the tax.",343,,
1262,0.97,8284.476,8293.418,"And so, I agree with Councilmember--when in something, this is not in the--this goes right to the text of the matter.",343,,
1263,0.97,8293.418,8305.463,"The meat of the matter, to the substantive portion that we are putting out to Seattle Motors.",343,,
1264,0.97,8305.463,8311.903,"So I understand why it was walked on so late, but I just want to emphasize that I would have to abstain as well.",343,,
1265,0.97,8311.903,8324.549,Because I think this deserves a full conversation and you can share as well and another couple of colleagues.,343,,
1266,0.97,8324.549,8326.518,We need to go back and talk to some folks.,343,,
1267,0.97,8326.518,8336.661,"And also, I really appreciate that you give an opportunity for the Advisory board to kind of weigh in on amendment three when we reduce the tax from six years to 4 years.",343,,
1268,0.97,8336.661,8340.765,And I would like to know what their thoughts are on this.,343,,
1269,0.97,8340.765,8344.169,"So I am going to say that this is the old lady, the gold and in group.",343,,
1270,0.97,8344.169,8350.308,There's a reason we have rules and deadlines for this very reason.,343,,
1271,0.97,8350.308,8356.581,"We have now spent 40 minutes on a matter that had we had this even yesterday, we could have actually voted on in.",343,,
1272,0.97,8356.581,8360.051,"So with that, I will be abstaining on this as well.",343,,
1273,0.97,8360.051,8360.652,Think you.,344,,
1274,0.97,8360.652,8369.394,So to restart the motion I'm hearing no objection to withdraw the amendment.,344,,
1275,0.97,8369.394,8375.166,The amendment with will be withdrawn.,344,,
1276,0.97,8375.166,8375.9,"Thank you, colleagues.",345,,
1277,0.97,8375.9,8378.303,Think you.,346,,
1278,0.97,8378.303,8386.411,So those are the end of our amendment and I think Councilmember Strauss may but want to be recognized for.,346,,
1279,0.97,8386.411,8387.479,"Thank you, chair Peterson.",347,,
1280,0.97,8387.479,8391.316,I do as per 1 million female.,347,,
1281,0.97,8391.316,8393.718,Deputy clerk Sanchez.,347,,
1282,0.97,8393.718,8403.928,Has Emailed me letting me know that I can reconsider amendment three or bring that for vote.,347,,
1283,0.97,8403.928,8413.538,"I'm going to let my colleagues know that at this time, I'm not going to bring that for reconsideration because we are talking about rates and the rates discussion is still ongoing.",347,,
1284,0.97,8413.538,8428.686,"I think that the duration and amount of rates, those are two conversations that are very interconnected and I think that that conversation needs to be held in tandem and not separately.",347,,
1285,0.97,8428.686,8435.26,So I move for amendments from full count to be in to address the intersection of rates and duration.,347,,
1286,0.97,8435.26,8448.106,"But for both items, I just need a little bit more time to think on these matters as we are addressing some really large issues that have lasting impact at a time of immense uncertainty.",347,,
1287,0.97,8448.106,8450.642,"Thank you, chair.",347,,
1288,0.97,8450.642,8453.878,Thank you.,348,,
1289,0.97,8453.878,8459.384,"Thank you, Councilmember Lewis.",348,,
1290,0.97,8459.384,8460.585,Those are the and of armaments.,348,,
1291,0.97,8460.585,8462.854,We are ready to go on the bill as amended.,348,,
1292,0.97,8462.854,8468.626,Are there any final comments or questions?,348,,
1293,0.97,8468.626,8471.763,Councilmember Mosqueda.,348,,
1294,0.97,8471.763,8474.399,"Think you very much, Mr.",349,,
1295,0.97,8474.399,8474.632,Chair.,349,,
1296,0.97,8474.632,8480.471,I just wanted to congratulate for you for your work and shepherding us through.,349,,
1297,0.97,8480.471,8484.542,This is a really critical endeavor.,349,,
1298,0.97,8484.542,8523.748,"And having just been on counsel for almost 6 or seven months now, and having us be for the majority of that remote, this is a challenging conversation to steward through and you have done it with relatively quick speed and I think made sure that folks had a chance to really provide tremendous input and get feedback from Stakeholders Pics I just want to say thank you for your work to move this effort along and per our conversations that we will have in the near future at the full council Committee on any additional votes.",349,,
1299,0.97,8523.748,8530.655,"Regardless of what happens, you are moving forward to make sure that more people can access transit that will be reliable and accessible.",349,,
1300,0.97,8530.655,8533.324,The option to not do something is just not an option for us.,349,,
1301,0.97,8533.324,8541.866,And you have made sure that we were moving forward and making sure that transit is available for folks.,349,,
1302,0.97,8541.866,8550.375,"I look forward to the Monday conversation that will come in a week and a half here, but I really just want to thank you for your work to shepherd us through this in such trying times, do it with such grace.",349,,
1303,0.97,8550.375,8552.777,I appreciate you and thanks for doing this.,349,,
1304,0.97,8552.777,8554.479,"Thank you, Councilmember.",350,,
1305,0.97,8554.479,8561.085,So there are no further comments.,350,,
1306,0.97,8561.085,8570.295,But we are ready to move out of committee.,350,,
1307,0.97,8570.295,8571.896,I think we need a motion for that.,350,,
1308,0.97,8571.896,8574.799,I moved to move this bill out of committee.,350,,
1309,0.97,8574.799,8581.806,Is there a second?,350,,
1310,0.97,8581.806,8582.14,Second.,351,,
1311,0.97,8582.14,8582.874,Any comments or questions?,351,,
1312,0.97,8582.874,8584.509,Last chance until the 27th.,351,,
1313,0.97,8584.509,8585.043,Councilmember Strauss.,351,,
1314,0.97,8585.043,8587.512,"I want to thank you, chair.",352,,
1315,0.97,8587.512,8587.912,Great work.,352,,
1316,0.97,8587.912,8590.582,"Thank you, thank you.",353,,
