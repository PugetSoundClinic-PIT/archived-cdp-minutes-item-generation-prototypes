49,0.97,352.452,384.917,"Thank you, I moved to amend the proposed introduction by introducing a resolution entitled a resolution supporting the taxation of the is this is in Seattle to find housing and essential services, urging the Washington state Legislature to oppose any Preemption or ban or other ban on Seattle's ability to raise revenue through big business taxes or other progressive Úresources and requesting the office of Intergovernmental relations, two Washington state lawmakers by affording it to the city council for adoption.",19,,
50,0.97,384.917,386.018,Thank you Councilmember Sawant.,20,,
51,0.97,386.018,406.139,"I am going to second the motion today, I will note that I am not going to be supportive of amending agenda to include this item, because I think it was included on Friday after the introduction of referral calendar requirements, but I will Seconded so you can speak to it.",20,,
52,0.97,406.139,407.74,And then we will see if there's a vote.,20,,

54,0.97,411.644,415.314,Thank you.,21,,
55,0.97,415.314,421.22,"I want to speak to the resolution itself, and also why I feel like there is a dire urgency to vote on it today.",21,,
56,0.97,421.22,436.269,"This resolution States that the city council supports progressive business taxes rather than taxes on working people, it States that the city council opposes presumption and urges the Mayor to public we approach Preemption as he has publicly so far refused to do so.",21,,
57,0.97,436.269,455.621,"The resolution is specifically referring to what many of you may know now, which is Statehouse bill 2907, House bill 2907 is passed, would allow King County to enter passing maximum tax on big business of $121 million a year.",21,,
58,0.97,455.621,469.168,"I just want to make three things clear to all of us, the hospital does not itself create any new revenues, if the hospital passes, part of the state Legislature successfully depend on Kane County success past which they may or may not do, there is no knowing if they would do it or not.",21,,
59,0.97,469.168,485.418,"And if King County chose to pass the largest possible tax, which would be Allowabl under the new authority that would be created, it would generate about 10% of the county's needs, 10%, which means the vast majority of our needs would still remain unfunded.",21,,
60,0.97,485.418,506.105,"We are, of course, as a movement, in favor of any big business taxes even if it is not adequate, even if in best case it would be 10%, because we want every affordable home and we want every possible solution to address the deep crisis in our society.",21,,
61,0.97,506.105,510.71,"But, it is important to acknowledge that the only reason this bill evening this is because of the pressure of our movement.",21,,
62,0.97,510.71,550.816,"The tax and is on movement has already billed serious momentum this year, and this is a momentum that big Bigness cannot afford to ignore, this is on coming on the heels of the incredible victories that we had last year, despite big business attempting to straight up do a carpet takeover of city hall .'s has been a zoning law passing out of committee last Friday which some politicians say they have brought business to the table, but we have to be serious and ask the question, the corporations and the wealthy including Jeff Bezos fought tooth and nail against having to pay a small amount in taxes.",21,,
63,0.97,550.816,553.486,"Then in Bolden, they went on to attempt to buy City Hall.",21,,
64,0.97,553.486,561.794,Why would the same rich people now come to the table and accept potentially having to pay $121 million for King County's?,21,,
65,0.97,561.794,577.209,"Because, the real price that they want is something called the Preemption clause, which is not in the bill right now, but as we have seen in the state Legislature, it could come into the next Iteration or the next Iteration of the bill.",21,,
66,0.97,577.209,595.795,"So, we are here to make sure we understand Preemption is I will finish, a Wonky sounding term, but if it passes, it would be a very serious and historic attack on working people in our city, because it would be a statewide ban on raising any new big business taxes.",21,,
67,0.97,595.795,610.242,"That would mean in other words, that if the Preemption clause passes in this bill, Seattle could not raise taxes on big business this year or any other year.",21,,
68,0.97,610.242,622.722,"Preemption would be an Anti- Democratic ban on taxing this business right at the moment that our tax Amazon movement is finally coming to a point where we have brought enough unity that we could potentially have a successful, valid initiative.",21,,
69,0.97,622.722,651.083,"And, it is all in the context of Seattle and Washington state having the most Regressive tax system in the entire nation, that is why I really appreciate seat state Senator Joe went for publicly opposing such a ban, and I think city Councilmember Tammy morale is in county Councilmember--in joining me in Authoring an Op-Ed that was just published in the stranger, I think we have copies.",21,,
70,0.97,651.083,658.391,I also think the Seattle city council members for the joint letter that we have signed and Councilperson Mosqueda for initiated the letter.,21,,
71,0.97,658.391,667.4,"But as you yourself said, we need every tool in our Toolbox, and we are facing a potentially egregious and historic attack.",21,,
72,0.97,667.4,680.813,"Given the stiff deadline of the House of votes, I do not want the resolution that I have brought forward to be postponed, and it is complementary, the resolution is complementary to the letter that we have already signed.",21,,
73,0.97,680.813,683.416,I would really urge the Council to pass this resolution today.,21,,
74,0.97,683.416,684.016,Thank you.,21,,
75,0.97,684.016,689.789,"Thank you very much, Councilmember Sawant.",22,,
76,0.97,689.789,696.228,[Applause],22,,
77,0.97,696.228,719.151,"So, I would encourage folks to remember that the conversation around this bill is happening in Olympia and the message that we have delivered as a unanimous body today via the letter that was signed, is to support the message that Preemption takes away a tool in the Toolkit in Seattle here.",23,,
78,0.97,719.151,749.949,"I, very much appreciate the words that you just mentioned, I know we have had conversations at the counsel table over the last few weeks about the United message here, my concern with amending the agenda today is really a matter of process, we have heard from folks that they need additional time to look at the resolution, and in the meantime, we have all signed onto a letter that includes all of the Councilmembers that were present in this body today, folks were saying that we are sending a United message, a conversation about a message for Progressive revenue and an opposition to Preemption.",23,,
79,0.97,749.949,774.94,"This is an opportunity for us today via this letter in combination with the folks who are here sharing the message in Olympia and works the folks who supported this effort in the past to raise progressive revenue to ensure that our region gets significant dollars in hand, and we have said so in a letter that make sure that we are United around the call for millions of dollars in revenue to be brought in to address the problem.",23,,
80,0.97,774.94,785.818,"We have a Council that unanimously sent a letter asking folks to keep moving the bill forward as introduced to a lien against Preemption, and to further strengthen the bill as it was introduced.",23,,
81,0.97,785.818,803.369,"I absolutely agree that the message that was sent over the last few years has been that there are people want there to be aggressive revenue, we are tired of using sales tax and property tax, we need more progressive revenue tools in our Toolkit.",23,,
82,0.97,803.369,814.446,And the letter asks our colleagues in Olympia to instead of considering tools that take away taxing authority to give us more progressive taxing option so we can adequately respond to the crisis in our community.,23,,
83,0.97,814.446,825.357,"Good news is that the bill advance for Committee on Friday and it does not have Preemption in it, it creates a progressive revenue that can be a tool coupled with additional revenue streams additional progressive revenue streams can get us closer to matching the authority.",23,,
84,0.97,825.357,837.736,"I want to be clear that this is not the bill that I think the corporations, the large corporation wanted to introduce, it is a bill that actually helps us with the progressive revenue call, the we wanted to be more.",23,,
85,0.97,837.736,852.985,And I applaud representative Macquarie who has been the prime representative of the bill to make sure that the bill was introduced in a strong way and to solicit ideas and encouragement from the community to make sure that it stays strong.,23,,
86,0.97,852.985,859.758,I also know that there is some business folks who sign in support of the bill as is and I think that is helpful to see that type of leadership.,23,,
87,0.97,859.758,894.426,"I want to reiterate that the councils letter does send a strong message, and bolted out in the viewpoints, the desire to have more revenue that closely Aligns with substantial needs of the region as outlined in the regional affordable housing task force and the most recent McKinsey report calls a clearly our deep concerns run Preemption and that we oppose Preemption, specifically calls for allocated spending threshold to make sure that spending is being Frontloaded into housing and not into mats on the floor that we need enhanced shelters and housing and mental health services.",23,,
88,0.97,894.426,909.241,"Finally, clarifies the revenue be allocated both to the regional homeless authority and to the county and city so we have your clarity in the legislation for where those dollars go.",23,,
89,0.97,909.241,911.777,"So, we all stood appear standing behind the call for regional solution.",23,,
90,0.97,911.777,916.348,"We have all been appear standing, United as a call for more revenue.",23,,
91,0.97,916.348,920.252,We have all been United in a call for Progressive revenue.,23,,
92,0.97,920.252,920.853,And against Preemption.,23,,
93,0.97,920.853,922.321,That messages clearly sent in the letter.,23,,
94,0.97,922.321,956.121,"I don't want to make it one versus the other because it is not, as you said clearly just a moment ago, this is about wanting us to be on the record, there is clear guidance anything in the letter that we have today, that is not to take away from the conversation around the resolution if this does not move forward on the introduction and referral calendar today, it is a procedural action only and I want to reiterate that for our colleagues and the viewing public as well, that this is a procedural action and it will continue to have the ability to have a conversation in the future.",23,,
95,0.97,956.121,959.291,"I know you know that, we have had a chance to have a conversation around it.",23,,
96,0.97,959.291,967.032,"In terms of process, I think that we will need to move on and have this have a vote for the introduction referral calendar.",23,,
97,0.97,967.032,969.702,"The one thing I would like to say, did you have one more thing?",23,,
98,0.97,969.702,975.107,"Okay, then I will wrap it up.",23,,
99,0.97,975.107,1012.544,"Well, I just wanted to say that I am all for unity, but when it advances progressive causes, and I feel it is my duty to clarify that while I appreciate all progressive leaders, including representative Macquarie when they do progressive actions, I am extremely concerned that is the prime sponsor of the bill, she has not only not spoken out against Preemption, she has specifically told, I am quoting from an article, that she is leaving the door open for Preemption, and that she is concerned, her main concern is that businesses should not be double taxed.",24,,
100,0.97,1012.544,1015.581,"I am sorry, our state is dead last, dead last in taxing the business.",24,,
101,0.97,1015.581,1027.526,"Taxation of big's should not be our concern, and I speak as an elected official, myself, no elected official has some sort of guaranteed right to be called progressive if you're not doing progressive actions.",24,,
102,0.97,1027.526,1042.741,"This is not about one bill as we have agreed, this will be an historic attack, this is not taking one or two away from our Toolbox, this is taking away our only tool.",24,,
103,0.97,1042.741,1053.485,"So, it would be an historic attack and I am worried that if we don't speak out from the rooftops that this could be a done deal.",24,,
104,0.97,1053.485,1077.109,"And in my conscience, I want to be clear that I have done everything in my power as an elected representative to speak out against it, that is why I am urging that we vote on this today, and also what we have heard from progressive Union representatives who have had meetings with representatives like Macquarie, they are worried that there could be things afoot in the Appropriations Committee which has a deadline of 5:00 P.M.",24,,
105,0.97,1077.109,1092.724,"Tomorrow forgiven all of those deadlines, given what a threat this would be for the future, our city and the most voluble people, especially the black community which has been pushed out of the central district, I feel it is important that we do this today.",24,,
106,0.97,1092.724,1093.125,[Applause],24,,
107,0.97,1093.125,1099.631,"Okay, Councilmember Herbold.",25,,
108,0.97,1099.631,1111.009,And then I'm going to wrap us up.,25,,
109,0.97,1111.009,1118.05,"Vote today, vote today, vote today.",26,,
110,0.97,1118.05,1126.458,"Okay folks, the last time we had a conversation in this body I asked people to not chant.",27,,
111,0.97,1126.458,1130.395,I asked people to raise their hands like this if they agree or signal otherwise that they disagree.,27,,
112,0.97,1130.395,1135.968,"We are going to get through today's counsel Committee, and we have to have a follow-up conversation specifically about homelessness and housing.",27,,
113,0.97,1135.968,1144.81,"There is another outburst, unfortunately I'm going to has have to ask the body to be cleared and I don't want to do that because this is a democratic process.",27,,
114,0.97,1144.81,1157.589,"Please do what we did in the committee last week if you were here, we have folks do this and it worked well, people show their support, I am asking for people to recognize the unity that we are sending us a message.",27,,
115,0.97,1157.589,1164.229,"Councilmember Herbold and then I need to wrap us up, this is a procedural conversation and we are going to move on to a vote on the amendment of the referral calendar.",27,,
116,0.97,1164.229,1165.898,Thank you.,28,,
117,0.97,1165.898,1187.185,"Just because the Council President pro Tem did a good job of the overview of the letter, I want to actually read from a portion of the letter because I don't want there to be any misunderstanding of the strong stance that this counsel has taken around the issue of Preemption.",28,,
118,0.97,1187.185,1208.373,"We support regional solutions using progressive revenue sources to solve our crises and we desire a comprehensive solution that does not rely on Deckard steps to solve this enormous problem, but we cannot currently support attempts that preempt us or strip us of our limited resources, and make our city's tax code even more Regressive.",28,,
119,0.97,1208.373,1216.181,"The city's taxation power is already extremely limited, and as it relates to this taxation tool, in many ways, underutilized.",28,,
120,0.97,1216.181,1225.924,To allow the Preemption in that context SETS up municipalities like Seattle to be on a slippery slope to further limiting our already narrow taxation powers.,28,,
121,0.97,1225.924,1229.661,"In the long-term, this would be a mistake.",28,,
122,0.97,1229.661,1239.004,"Instead, we support legislative efforts to the state register to provide additional progressive taxation offices to municipalities.",28,,
123,0.97,1239.004,1242.174,"This is a strong statement against Preemption, thank you.",28,,
124,0.97,1242.174,1242.975,"Okay, thank you.",29,,
125,0.97,1242.975,1247.412,"We are going to go ahead and vote, counsel collects.",29,,
126,0.97,1247.412,1255.387,"All of those in favor of amending the introduction referral counsel to include the resolution as outlined by Councilmember Sawant, say I.",29,,
127,0.97,1255.387,1257.656,Any opposed?,29,,
128,0.97,1257.656,1258.056,Nay.,30,,
129,0.97,1258.056,1266.398,There are no extensions.,31,,
130,0.97,1266.398,1270.669,"There is not the votes to include this in the introduction and referral counsel, so the motion fails today.",31,,
131,0.97,1270.669,1276.308,"I did want to reiterate that does not mean it is the end of the conversation, this is a procedural action just for changing the agenda.",31,,
132,0.97,1276.308,1281.913,"We are aware that and I think the conversation continues, thank you Councilmember Herbold for 2ND from the letter.",31,,
133,0.97,1281.913,1286.285,We are going to move on.,31,,
134,0.97,1286.285,1296.528,"Here we go, item number one on the agenda, please.",32,,
135,0.97,1296.528,1297.729,"Oh, let's to public comment.",33,,
136,0.97,1297.729,1298.63,That will be fun.,33,,

462,0.97,3507.637,3512.141,Last November the Seattle Renters Commission recommended they take up this issue.,125,,
463,0.97,3512.141,3514.244,Winter Evictions are cruel and harmful.,125,,
464,0.97,3514.244,3526.856,In 2018 the Seattle women's Commission and the King County bar Association study losing home and the cost of Eviction in Seattle.,125,,
465,0.97,3526.856,3536.165,The study found 50% of people.,125,,
466,0.97,3536.165,3546.676,People of color were evicted.,125,,
467,0.97,3549.846,3564.961,Most Seattle tenants are evicted for not paying their rent in for being short on rent and in most cases the study found that the evicted tenants owed one month or less for rent.,125,,
468,0.97,3564.961,3578.942,"In one case they were evicted for owing $10 and there was an article showing a tenant, she fought her I--her Eviction but one for $3 short on her rent.",125,,
469,0.97,3578.942,3582.712,You cannot make this stuff up.,125,,
470,0.97,3582.712,3589.018,The study reviewed that found 6 Seattle tenants died during or right after Evictions.,125,,
471,0.97,3589.018,3599.095,"Four committed suicide, one died of an accidental Overdose a day after being evicted and one died during the Eviction process while receiving Hospice care.",125,,
472,0.97,3599.095,3607.837,9 people who died homeless on the street in 2017 had an Eviction filed against them in the three preceding years.,125,,
473,0.97,3607.837,3610.406,It is happening to so many people.,125,,
474,0.97,3610.406,3618.915,"I urge everyone to read ""Seattle times"" that was published over the weekend where housing people evicted in King County.",125,,
475,0.97,3618.915,3631.127,The data is a brutal Enlightment of a housing market that is dominated by corporate landlords that care more about profit than housing people.,125,,
476,0.97,3631.127,3645.375,"I recognize there are good rental units throughout, they care about their tenants and make timely repairs and don't try to get away with charging the highest possible rents and do not exploit their tenants.",125,,
477,0.97,3645.375,3649.412,"Those landlords are not doing winter Evictions, they are not the problem.",125,,
478,0.97,3649.412,3654.617,The Renter's Commission pointed out and I want to quote from the letter.,125,,
479,0.97,3654.617,3659.389,During winter in Seattle temperatures regularly fall into the 30s overnight.,125,,
480,0.97,3659.389,3675.038,"According to all of the King county in, a report for 2019, 41% of homeless neighbors sleep outside every night with an additional 19% sleeping in vehicles.",125,,
481,0.97,3675.038,3677.74,They do not provide protection against the weather.,125,,
482,0.97,3677.74,3685.982,More on how being outside in the winter is obviously you cannot fully isolate what immediate causes of debt were.,125,,
483,0.97,3685.982,3701.297,I really thank the members of the Renter Commission for demonstrating leadership on this issue and I wanted to point out that one of the members in Renters Commission is now a staff member Councilmember Morales.,125,,
484,0.97,3701.297,3722.385,I wanted to recommend his work as well and I want to thank city council central staff and also city attorneys office for fully engaging and developing on this issue and developing the work that we needed and city attorney's and legislation.,125,,
485,0.97,3722.385,3733.763,"Just to give a time line of where we came here, the bill was recommended by Renter's Commission in early November, introducing the first draft.",125,,
486,0.97,3733.763,3739.469,We discussed it thoroughly and the Sustainability and Renters'Rights committee.,125,,
487,0.97,3739.469,3749.912,The bill that was voted out was an amended of the previous version that took into account many concerns that we had heard in a thorough manner.,125,,
488,0.97,3749.912,3755.985,And it was voted on February 3RD but the vote was delayed by the Council holding it today.,125,,
489,0.97,3755.985,3765.495,I hope we are able to vote today just 1 point I wanted to make in general on the amendment and then on the specific amendments I will speak when they are moved.,125,,
490,0.97,3765.495,3782.512,"I am disappointed to see many of the amendments that Councilmembers are bringing forward will actually, if passed, if these amendments pass, will make it more difficult and restrictive for Renters to be protected by this Eviction ban.",125,,
491,0.97,3782.512,3795.291,Lewis amendment that I support and ready last week and I wanted to point out that it is shocking to see how E Licted officials demand endless data for the smallest measure to benefit for working class people.,125,,
492,0.97,3795.291,3802.732,"But really, there are programs that are pushed forward, policies that are pushed forward with no data at all.",125,,
493,0.97,3802.732,3814.377,"This week, homeless people there are endless data that they don't work and the city spend $8 million on that.",125,,
494,0.97,3814.377,3836.065,I welcome the support of my colleagues as a bill as a whole but disappointed that the amendments will not help people facing Evictions but I will wait for the amendments to come.,125,,
495,0.97,3836.065,3836.732,Thank you Councilmember.,126,,
496,0.97,3836.732,3844.807,"I think it is important that the bill move forward, this is a really good vehicle for us to build upon.",126,,
497,0.97,3844.807,3860.556,"If amendments do hang there is always work to do with any piece of legislation but I want to commend you for bringing it forward Andcouncil colleagues that I think will find ways to make it Implementable, meaningful and always the first step to continue to get work on.",126,,
498,0.97,3860.556,3863.326,I would like to say for folks in the press.,126,,
499,0.97,3863.326,3868.364,If you are used to going to the halls of the state Capitol they have a press table.,126,,
500,0.97,3868.364,3869.398,We do not have it.,126,,
501,0.97,3869.398,3875.638,"You are welcome to use the table here if you need your laptop, you are able to come here.",126,,
502,0.97,3875.638,3881.11,For security folks here if there is any press a place for their laptop they are welcome to have that.,126,,
503,0.97,3881.11,3893.889,"We now have 6 amendments, we will take them in the orders as they appear on the agenda.",127,,
504,0.97,3893.889,3895.024,I move amendment one.,128,,
505,0.97,3895.024,3896.192,I am sorry.,129,,
506,0.97,3896.192,3899.528,Do I need to move the bill or are we good?,129,,
507,0.97,3899.528,3899.795,Okay.,130,,
508,0.97,3899.795,3902.898,"Great, go ahead and move it and I will second it.",130,,
509,0.97,3902.898,3905.101,I move amendment one.,131,,
510,0.97,3905.101,3905.968,I second it.,132,,
511,0.97,3905.968,3908.671,This amendment is a technical amendment.,133,,
512,0.97,3908.671,3927.156,Does not make changes it adds a justice cause to Evictions that are identical to one included in this legislation that regards a time when a landlord is legally required to Evict someone and responsible for relocation assistance.,133,,
513,0.97,3927.156,3931.994,"This amendment adds a clarifying ""where as"" clause and winter Evictions a defense.",133,,
514,0.97,3931.994,3938.234,It is the case but the language makes it more clear.,133,,
515,0.97,3938.234,3943.072,Questions and comments on amendment number one by Councilmember Sawant.,134,,
516,0.97,3943.072,3943.539,Seeing none.,134,,
517,0.97,3943.539,3959.989,"It is moved and Seconded that the bill be amended with number 1, no comments, all of those in favor of amendment one vote.",134,,
518,0.97,3959.989,3960.256,Opposed.,134,,
519,0.97,3960.256,3965.094,There are 7. it will be included in the underlined bill.,135,,
520,0.97,3965.094,3967.096,The second amendment is from Councilmember Lewis.,135,,
521,0.97,3967.096,3969.932,Councilmember Lewis would you like to move your amendment?,135,,
522,0.97,3969.932,3972.101,"Yes, I do so move my amendment.",136,,
523,0.97,3972.101,3972.702,Second.,137,,
524,0.97,3972.702,3979.275,Would you like to speak to your amendment?,138,,
525,0.97,3979.275,3979.508,Yes.,139,,
526,0.97,3979.508,3981.944,"Thank you, Madam President Pro- Tem.",139,,
527,0.97,3981.944,4009.138,When we discussed this ordinance in committee one of my Takeaways from it or one of the criticisms of the ordinance was that there was a mechanism to put in place to compensate landlords in the event that there was an economic Eviction that potentially put a small landlords in the position where they would have to face hardship especially households that are dependent on their income as we make as a landlord.,140,,
528,0.97,4009.138,4024.687,A lot of the comments we heard at public comment today addressed that concern with a lot of landlords and the concerns of primary source of income is renting a small number of units.,140,,
529,0.97,4024.687,4029.725,"So, under this amendment we would establish a mitigation Fund.",140,,
530,0.97,4029.725,4032.728,It would only be accessible to folks who establish this defense.,140,,
531,0.97,4032.728,4041.17,It is important that we talk about this moratorium we are talking about an Eviction proceeding in the way it is is Aplied.,140,,
532,0.97,4041.17,4060.89,"In the case that a tenant facing Eviction is able to have this defense it would exist as a fund that could be accessed by the tenant in order to pay rent or access additional rental assistance the reason I raise this, it is not a fund I would take from rental support funds.",140,,
533,0.97,4060.89,4078.107,The vision of this is that we would fund hopefully in this false budget an additional rental support fund that would apply in the event that a tenant would not receive it through existing funds.,140,,
534,0.97,4078.107,4095.624,"I had staff come up with ballpark price, the cost varies--the estimate depends how long the legislation will cover in event of 5 months it would be $1.6 million.",140,,
535,0.97,4095.624,4107.436,This estimate is based on the current number of Evictions from the losing home report in 2017 based on an estimate for the winter period.,140,,
536,0.97,4107.436,4112.041,That Eviction is minus the number of people who received home base assistance.,140,,
537,0.97,4112.041,4126.455,And then that comes up with the number of an estimated about 169 folks in a given winter that could potentially face Eviction in the winter months.,140,,
538,0.97,4126.455,4129.925,"So, I think it is a doable number to fund mitigation fund like this.",140,,
539,0.97,4129.925,4150.212,"I think it gets at the core concerns of a lot of the landlords, particularly small landlords in a position they feel like this Eviction moratorium would cause them severe hardship in being able to provide in the event that someone is in a position where they can't pay their rent.",140,,
540,0.97,4150.212,4166.228,We do know it is all too common in this country right now where a overwhelming number of Americans are within complete homelessness or bankruptcy for unanticipated $500 expense.,140,,
541,0.97,4166.228,4181.71,A fund like this can provide needed assistance and I hope to Revisit this in the fall when we are looking at budget priorities and for the time being I would ask that we move this amendment and incorporate it into the ordinance.,140,,
542,0.97,4181.71,4189.985,"Thank you, Councilmember Lewis.",141,,
543,0.97,4189.985,4195.291,"Anymore comments or questions, comments, Councilmember Savant and Herbold.",141,,
544,0.97,4195.291,4196.425,I support it.,142,,
545,0.97,4196.425,4208.938,Helping tenants avoid the Eviction all together and noted there are funds most notable the home base program that is operated program I support increasing funding for those programs.,142,,
546,0.97,4208.938,4223.986,"I want to point out how much the Mayor's office opposed this legislation and in addition to the letters and memos they sent, even minutes before the meeting started sending us another letter opposing this legislation.",142,,
547,0.97,4223.986,4232.461,One of the things they attempted to do is Counteroppose the moratorium against mitigation funding and other Renter assistance.,142,,
548,0.97,4232.461,4238.033,I want to clarify they are both necessary and they both work well together.,142,,
549,0.97,4238.033,4253.182,It is good to have this amendment and just to echo what was just said that this amendment creates the framework for mitigation funding to make it a reality we would need to push for resources in the budget in November.,142,,
550,0.97,4253.182,4254.049,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",143,,
551,0.97,4254.049,4309.505,"I have a question about the mitigation Fund and how it interacts with the effective date of this legislation, as I understand it this legislation as currently drafted the effective date would be about 10 days before April and because I am--I am truly concerned about the impact of this legislation on small landlords I am wondering is there concerns that the mitigation, either this mitigation fund or the capacity of current rental assistants funds will be able to meet the need for those 10 days before this goes into effect?",144,,
552,0.97,4309.505,4313.342,Do we have information about that?,144,,
553,0.97,4313.342,4313.509,,145,,
554,0.97,4313.509,4315.444,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",146,,
555,0.97,4315.444,4323.152,My understanding from central staff and executive departments is that we will not be in a position this winter to offer resources through this fund.,146,,
556,0.97,4323.152,4331.36,That this fund--this is really a Forward-Looking resource to next winter.,146,,
557,0.97,4331.36,4349.778,"When this--whatever window we decide on we are considering a amendment to determine what the window would be, there would be no resources in this until we go through another budget cycle.",146,,
558,0.97,4349.778,4351.88,Councilmember Savant.,147,,
559,0.97,4351.88,4352.915,Home base has funds --,148,,
560,0.97,4352.915,4355.651,"Yes, this particular fund yes.",149,,
561,0.97,4355.651,4383.612,It is my understanding as it relates to how this legislation would be implemented the home base funds it is different because of the timing of how this--how a tenant would assert a defense under just cause and it is my understanding they would not be eligible for the funds.,150,,
562,0.97,4383.612,4384.346,I might be wrong.,150,,
563,0.97,4384.346,4387.75,Just shake your head or nod your head.,150,,
564,0.97,4387.75,4389.184,They are eligible.,151,,
565,0.97,4389.184,4389.718,Okay.,152,,
566,0.97,4389.718,4390.018,Thank you.,152,,

568,0.97,4392.888,4393.222,Seeing none.,153,,
569,0.97,4393.222,4400.929,I also want to under score my support for this thank you Councilmember Lewis with working with our office on this amendment.,153,,
570,0.97,4400.929,4409.538,Given the model as home base Fund and we know they have a proven track record of being successful for providing funds to avoid Eviction.,153,,
571,0.97,4409.538,4412.441,I think it makes a lot of sense.,153,,
572,0.97,4412.441,4417.146,In cases they may not qualify it creates a fund to meet those needs.,153,,
573,0.97,4417.146,4430.526,It is--I think it is a common sense amendment and echoed by the testimony today and came from the calls we received in our office and appreciate you advancing this.,153,,
574,0.97,4430.526,4443.405,The intent to make it upstream and avoid Evictions in the first place and impacts on the housing providers many of which are Nonprofits that somebody else testified on earlier today.,153,,
575,0.97,4443.405,4445.307,I will also be supporting this amendment.,153,,
576,0.97,4445.307,4456.985,"With that all of those in favor of amendment 2, vote and raise your hand.",154,,
577,0.97,4456.985,4457.386,No oppose.,155,,

590,0.97,4593.789,4605.033,There is unfortunately an example of a politician proposing a policy that benefit for those that more than most with no data or evidence to support it.,162,,
591,0.97,4605.033,4610.339,I want to talk about the amendment and explain why I oppose it.,162,,
592,0.97,4610.339,4624.653,"But just quickly because a comment was made on the structure of the committee table this is a committee chair, I chair Renters'Rights committee.",162,,

596,0.97,4636.465,4645.34,They are understandable on the other hand and also on the other hand are not the basis for policy making in my view.,162,,
597,0.97,4645.34,4655.45,"""What IFS"" are not part of policy making, hard core data that is showing the most vulnerable are the ones damaged by not having strong laws against Eviction.",162,,
598,0.97,4655.45,4675.704,That is the basis for policy making and the people we had at the table were the tenants unit in Washington State and the most impacted including Alicia who was evicted in the winter and her as a consequence of her Eviction her life took a dramatically devastating turn where she lost family members.,162,,
599,0.97,4675.704,4678.673,"So, I don't apologize for the structure of the committee table.",162,,
600,0.97,4678.673,4688.65,I am proud it is one of committee tables where people who never have an opening in city hall are invited and we will continue to do that.,162,,
601,0.97,4688.65,4689.084,[crowd cheering],162,,
602,0.97,4689.084,4712.074,"We have--we have hard data of thousands of people being evicted and as I said, totally hypothetical of a landlord that only owns four rental homes and on the verge of winter bankruptcy it is hard if you own four units how are you on the verge of bankruptcy?",163,,
603,0.97,4712.074,4713.141,I don't understand.,163,,
604,0.97,4713.141,4716.311,It is possible but what are the Statics there.,164,,
605,0.97,4716.311,4720.682,"My office met with small landlords, not like we have not met with them.",164,,
606,0.97,4720.682,4725.42,Testified about their concerns about this legislation in the committee meeting.,164,,
607,0.97,4725.42,4726.788,None of them evicted their tenants.,164,,
608,0.97,4726.788,4733.762,We were unable to come to an agreement on the policy but I appreciate their time and willingness to discuss it.,164,,
609,0.97,4733.762,4739.634,The point remains the small landlord that this amendment is intended to help is hypothetical.,164,,
610,0.97,4739.634,4746.174,But the tenants whose lives are destroyed and for whom this amendment would not help.,164,,
611,0.97,4746.174,4748.076,That is very real.,164,,
612,0.97,4748.076,4748.877,Those tenants are very real.,164,,
613,0.97,4748.877,4758.954,The biggest problem is the impact it would have on the Renters who are renting with the worst Slumlords in our city.,164,,
614,0.97,4758.954,4764.392,Slumlords overwhelmingly divide up their properties to hind their common ownership.,164,,
615,0.97,4764.392,4781.91,"Wild this amendment says that different LLC's owned by the same person count as a large landlord, the reality is it is impossible for Renters to know what other properties their landlord owns, do any of you are Renters know what other properties that your landlord owns?",164,,
616,0.97,4781.91,4784.146,Do you have the resources to find it out?,164,,
617,0.97,4784.146,4802.531,"My office, with all of the resources we have from being in city hall we attempted to track down all of the properties owned by some of the Slumlords that we know are abusing their tenants and found it is extremely hard and actually impossible to do it without completely have devoting your resources.",164,,
618,0.97,4802.531,4817.279,"We did not have access F. we don't have access to that information how is it Renters facing Eviction who are the most marginalized any way, world being turned upside down, how are they supposed to find out all of this information?",164,,
619,0.97,4817.279,4824.252,How will they know they are protected or not?,164,,
620,0.97,4824.252,4828.023,Many tenants facing Eviction do not know about their power.,164,,
621,0.97,4828.023,4837.032,The attorneys that help those Renters in the court will tell you that they end up helping a fraction of the Renters because most Renters do not come to court.,164,,
622,0.97,4837.032,4844.239,In reality this amendment will end up meaning where it is intended or not.,164,,
623,0.97,4844.239,4859.454,The worst Slumlords that are Evicting people will be exempted from the legislation in the name of protecting good small landlords and therefore I will not support this amendment.,164,,
624,0.97,4859.454,4862.791,Any other comments or questions.,165,,

628,0.97,4864.459,4868.964,I appreciate this and thank you for bringing out the intent and vs not intent.,169,,
629,0.97,4868.964,4875.637,We talked about wanting to make sure we did not Impugn the motives of anyone.,169,,
630,0.97,4875.637,4882.277,Did I see you reach for the microphone Councilmember Herbold?,169,,
631,0.97,4882.277,4885.981,I appreciate the intent of this amendment.,170,,
632,0.97,4885.981,4905.8,I just don't see how it can be implemented given that it is virtual unknown.,170,,
633,0.97,4905.8,4906.601,"So, I appreciate the attempt.",170,,
634,0.97,4906.601,4911.64,Regretful we don't have more time to work out that part of the policy.,170,,

636,0.97,4913.108,4913.808,Anymore comments?,172,,
637,0.97,4913.808,4914.075,Okay.,173,,
638,0.97,4914.075,4914.409,Seeing none.,173,,
639,0.97,4914.409,4917.078,I am going to go ahead and call --,173,,
640,0.97,4917.078,4920.181,Unless you want to comment.,174,,
641,0.97,4920.181,4923.151,I want to address the concern.,175,,
642,0.97,4923.151,4930.625,Is there a concern that the landlord might register under a limited liability company or limited partnership?,175,,
643,0.97,4930.625,4935.73,That data is available from the Washington Secretary of state.,175,,
644,0.97,4935.73,4941.303,Are you saying the most vulnerable tenants are going to go to Washington web site and look at --,176,,
645,0.97,4941.303,4948.41,Let's not debate up here but if there is a question do you have response to where the data specific to that question?,177,,
646,0.97,4948.41,4948.61,Okay.,177,,
647,0.97,4948.61,4950.779,Are you looking at me?,178,,
648,0.97,4950.779,4951.78,Both of you.,179,,
649,0.97,4951.78,4952.047,Okay.,180,,
650,0.97,4952.047,4952.347,No problem.,180,,
651,0.97,4952.347,4952.681,It is okay.,180,,
652,0.97,4952.681,4956.751,I already said that my office tried to compile such data.,181,,
653,0.97,4956.751,4960.155,It is virtually impossible to do it with all of the resources we have.,181,,
654,0.97,4960.155,4972.0,I don't know what more evidence you need to show that for the most vulnerable tenants there is basically an impossible task you are putting on them.,181,,
655,0.97,4972.0,4972.267,Okay.,182,,
656,0.97,4972.267,4973.568,Any additional comments Councilmember Morales.,183,,
657,0.97,4973.568,4993.121,"I will say the work that we did shows of the buildings that are registered almost 29,000 buildings are registered with 4 units or less which means this would exclude 87% of the Renters in the city.",184,,
658,0.97,4993.121,4999.194,I do think that is a significant impact on what this legislation is trying to achieve.,184,,
659,0.97,4999.194,5010.005,"So, you know, and we know we heard most of our small landlords do try to work with tenants to prevent Eviction, do offer some kind of assistance or extension.",184,,
660,0.97,5010.005,5017.445,We now have mitigation fund that has been put in place to try to make sure that landlords are not effected by this.,184,,
661,0.97,5017.445,5022.15,"But as we said, those landlords are not the problem.",184,,
662,0.97,5022.15,5028.857,The problem are the landlords who do take things too far and are willing to push people out.,184,,
663,0.97,5028.857,5040.468,"I think it is important that we consider the scope or, you know, how this particular amendment would limit the scope of what we are trying to do here.",184,,
664,0.97,5040.468,5049.644,"It is not something that I could, in good conscious, support.",184,,
665,0.97,5049.644,5052.58,I appreciate you bringing it forward.,185,,
666,0.97,5052.58,5074.569,"I heard, too, concerns, initially I was intended to support it because similar to the argument that was made around some of our labor standards we never expect our employers to know franchises it was used in a different way and different here.",185,,
667,0.97,5074.569,5076.805,Given the Statistics that Morales just shared.,185,,
668,0.97,5076.805,5081.376,I Unfortunately will vote no on there but I appreciate where you are coming from with this.,185,,
669,0.97,5081.376,5092.32,"I am happy to keep working with you as we work with future amendments in that sounds to you, future legislation.",185,,
670,0.97,5092.32,5094.789,Do we have central staff available?,186,,
671,0.97,5094.789,5096.257,Central staff is available for questions.,187,,
672,0.97,5096.257,5098.626,It could be done in the committee.,187,,
673,0.97,5098.626,5104.199,What we can do is hold this amendment if it works and have them come back and answer questions.,187,,
674,0.97,5104.199,5109.537,As a sponsor of the bill I would prefer the bill is voted on today.,188,,
675,0.97,5109.537,5109.838,Right.,189,,
676,0.97,5109.838,5119.681,I am not mentioning holding it off today but to the end of our amendments and come back to it and have the questions answers.,190,,
677,0.97,5119.681,5120.915,Okay.,191,,
678,0.97,5120.915,5122.317,I see central staff.,191,,
679,0.97,5122.317,5123.351,Come on in.,191,,
680,0.97,5123.351,5123.718,"Welcome, Aly.",191,,
681,0.97,5123.718,5132.327,And if you don't mind introducing yourself for the record.,192,,
682,0.97,5132.327,5132.627,Welcome.,193,,
683,0.97,5132.627,5133.428,Good afternoon Councilmembers.,194,,
684,0.97,5133.428,5136.531,I was running down the hall.,194,,
685,0.97,5136.531,5138.733,I may of missed the question.,194,,
686,0.97,5138.733,5139.767,"So, thank you.",195,,
687,0.97,5139.767,5140.835,Thank you.,196,,
688,0.97,5140.835,5142.17,"So, I appreciate it.",197,,
689,0.97,5142.17,5160.855,"It is helpful to have the Statistics I just want to understand when at committee I thought you had mentioned the number and the range of 200,000 or so rental units just trying to get the scope of those that are 4 and under.",197,,
690,0.97,5160.855,5162.657,Or do we have those.,198,,
691,0.97,5162.657,5165.693,"If you don't have those, that is fine, too.",198,,
692,0.97,5165.693,5173.167,So it is somewhat of--I think we are not necessarily comparing apples and apples here.,199,,
693,0.97,5173.167,5184.812,Rental registration ordinance I am not sure if the numbers you are quoting Councilmember Morasles the type of structure.,199,,
694,0.97,5184.812,5190.852,If it is a unit.,199,,
695,0.97,5190.852,5211.439,"We have units in detached, Plexes and multifamily buildings, not necessarily all owned by the same people so what you your amendment would do would exclude units that are owned by a landlord who owns more than--excuse me, only owns 4 units and less.",199,,
696,0.97,5211.439,5213.708,It could all be in 1 unit.,199,,
697,0.97,5213.708,5220.048,The 4 Plex could be excluded if the same owner owns all four.,199,,
698,0.97,5220.048,5227.488,"It could be four units spread four single-family homes, multifamily buildings where they own condos or that sort of thing.",199,,
699,0.97,5227.488,5236.431,It is hard to know exactly the universe of units we are talking about here.,199,,
700,0.97,5236.431,5247.375,What I was referring to is data offered by Ssei.,200,,
701,0.97,5247.375,5250.979,"Excluding the buildings registered through that ordinance, units of 4 or more.",200,,
702,0.97,5250.979,5254.549,Councilmembers--I am not clear because of owners who owns them.,201,,
703,0.97,5254.549,5261.856,It is hard to know if some of those units in smaller buildings are owned by Llcs that own 25 units.,201,,
704,0.97,5261.856,5268.763,I am just not--I have not seen the data you are referring to know if I can sort it out.,201,,
705,0.97,5268.763,5277.071,I don't know that we are comparing apples and apples here.,201,,
706,0.97,5277.071,5279.707,Councilmember Sawant did you have one more thing?,202,,
707,0.97,5279.707,5289.717,"Yes, I wanted to say--I was thinking what Aly was saying in terms of the accuracy of the numbers.",203,,
708,0.97,5289.717,5308.036,I think having clarified that it does not change the fact that it is almost impossible thing for tenants to know.,203,,
709,0.97,5308.036,5309.037,It is a means testing.,203,,
710,0.97,5309.037,5311.005,It is putting the burden.,203,,
711,0.97,5311.005,5321.349,It is the same as in the sense of putting the burden on the effected party to figure out if they are eligible for this protection or not.,203,,
712,0.97,5321.349,5353.981,"Best to just make the protection available across the board and I will tell you something, Expedients and tenants who are facing rent gouging from their landlords, I am quoting a small business owner they were being gouged by a landlord in Columbia city and they started looking for spaces all around the city and they found that so many ever the properties exploited the landlord.",203,,
713,0.97,5353.981,5355.049,They are all spread out.,203,,
714,0.97,5355.049,5369.697,I don't know how to put the burden on the tenants and there is a component to this because black families and black children are the most impacted.,203,,

716,0.97,5370.098,5373.267,Any other comments or questions?,204,,
717,0.97,5373.267,5373.468,Okay.,204,,
718,0.97,5373.468,5381.075,"Council colleagues I think that we have heard a number of concerns about this, I am interested in getting the actual data.",204,,
719,0.97,5381.075,5385.813,I am sorry that was sprung on you Aly and we appreciate you running down the hall.,204,,
720,0.97,5385.813,5393.755,I think there is a rational argument for excluding small landlords and I wish that Hi that actual number in front of us.,204,,
721,0.97,5393.755,5407.101,I think there is a reason that we have excluded small businesses in the past when it came to some of the labor stand ARS and did not make it for workers.,204,,
722,0.97,5407.101,5415.843,Today I am going to support Councilmember Pedersen in looks at the smaller businesses and see how it goes and continue to advance the conversation today.,204,,
723,0.97,5415.843,5427.522,All of those in favor of including Pedersens amendment say Yea and opposed.,204,,
724,0.97,5427.522,5429.056,Opposed.,205,,
725,0.97,5429.056,5430.525,No.,206,,
726,0.97,5430.525,5430.992,It is 4-3. okay.,207,,
727,0.97,5430.992,5433.06,[crowd Booing],207,,
728,0.97,5433.06,5435.329,And we can continue with the amendments.,208,,
729,0.97,5435.329,5435.73,Councilmember --,208,,
730,0.97,5435.73,5441.736,Just in terms of process I am not sure what you mean continue with the amendment.,209,,
731,0.97,5441.736,5444.505,You voted for the amendment what does that mean?,209,,
732,0.97,5444.505,5446.641,There are three more amendments to come.,210,,
733,0.97,5446.641,5457.518,"No, I mean on that amendment you said you would continue the conversation.",211,,
734,0.97,5457.518,5459.12,The rest of them.,212,,
735,0.97,5459.12,5459.52,"Yes, yes.",213,,
736,0.97,5459.52,5465.693,Having voting on the prevailing side there is a chance before the end of today to go back and look at that.,213,,
737,0.97,5465.693,5469.964,I am not sure Aly if that data exists.,213,,
738,0.97,5469.964,5487.081,But I would be concerned if it was 80% and if there is a chance for us to come through this and go back I am happy for that but I would like us to take a quick second if you have feedback on that before we move the amendment forward.,213,,
739,0.97,5487.081,5492.687,I can try to get them on the phone to understand that data more precisely.,214,,
740,0.97,5492.687,5499.527,I think because the way this amendment is drafted it including if you are the owner or if you have an ownership interest in any unit.,214,,
741,0.97,5499.527,5509.57,So I don't know that we would be able to tell by looking at the rental regulation and inspection ordinance data who has an ownership interest in all --,214,,
742,0.97,5509.57,5512.139,That is the problem.,215,,
743,0.97,5512.139,5513.341,That are included.,216,,
744,0.97,5513.341,5514.108,It is difficult.,216,,
745,0.97,5514.108,5525.953,"Essentially just like the way the ordinance itself, the main purpose of the ordinance presents--provides a defense and Eviction proceeding.",216,,
746,0.97,5525.953,5537.298,They would have to claim they own less than 5 units fewer than 5 units and therefore it should not apply in that situation.,216,,
747,0.97,5537.298,5542.37,If they were lying they would be Liing in front of a court.,216,,
748,0.97,5542.37,5555.249,I obviously there is an over oversimplification.,216,,
749,0.97,5555.249,5558.252,I don't know if I can change that in 10 minutes.,216,,
750,0.97,5558.252,5566.327,"Assuming it is signed within 10 days by the Player and goes into effect 30 days after that, we will really only be relevant for a short period of time.",216,,
751,0.97,5566.327,5578.306,What I can do is work on trying to figure out what data we have and available and if necessary the Council could Revisit this prior to next November or wherever the period starts.,216,,
752,0.97,5578.306,5590.685,I don't know if I am going to be able to give you a satisfying answer in however long this meeting lasts.,216,,
753,0.97,5590.685,5591.919,Council President pro-tem.,217,,
754,0.97,5591.919,5605.733,To the question about this item being included in the bill let's go through the other amendments and see what we can get from them and having voted on the prevailing side there may be a chance to come back to this.,218,,
755,0.97,5605.733,5605.967,Okay.,218,,
756,0.97,5605.967,5611.605,Moving forward I would like to ask Councilmember Herbold would you like to move your amendment.,218,,
757,0.97,5611.605,5615.076,I would like to move amendment four.,219,,
758,0.97,5615.076,5616.444,Can you speak to your amendment.,219,,
759,0.97,5616.444,5620.314,Do I have a second.,220,,
760,0.97,5620.314,5620.614,Second.,221,,
761,0.97,5620.614,5621.215,This is perfect.,222,,
762,0.97,5621.215,5652.146,This is amending previous language that was add to the bill currently a reason for termination that is exempt from the bill includes unlawful behavior and this amendment would expand unlawful behavior to a particular type of lease violation that specifically impacts the health or safety of the other owner.,222,,
763,0.97,5652.146,5674.502,It is brought forward because of concerns from folks who operate nonprofit housing specifically through conversations I have had with the associate director through CCS community services.,222,,
764,0.97,5674.502,5677.505,It is a very narrow exemption.,222,,
765,0.97,5677.505,5688.582,Not for any rule violation but rule violations that have a negative impact on the health or safety of other tenants or the owner.,222,,
766,0.97,5688.582,5692.453,Thank you Councilmember Herbold any other comments or questions?,223,,
767,0.97,5692.453,5696.157,We are still procedural or are we discussing the amendment.,224,,
768,0.97,5696.157,5700.694,This is on amendment number 4 and if you have questions for her amendment specifically.,225,,
769,0.97,5700.694,5706.133,I would like to speak in favor of it.,226,,
770,0.97,5706.133,5706.534,Okay.,227,,
771,0.97,5706.534,5708.569,Go ahead Councilmember Lewis.,227,,
772,0.97,5708.569,5720.481,I think this amendment and I appreciate Councilmember Herbold bringing it forward goes a long way in strengthening the case that we do have a legal challenge related to this ordinance.,228,,
773,0.97,5720.481,5741.202,I think anything we can incorporate into it that gives more flexibility is more aware of existing rules and things that make it look more reasonable in court does go well for the legislation as a whole and surviving the challenge.,228,,
774,0.97,5741.202,5756.584,I think it is reasonable addition to make sure that we are not putting landlords in position there is ongoing activity for health and safety of the building but they are unable.,228,,
775,0.97,5756.584,5757.051,Enforce an Eviction.,228,,
776,0.97,5757.051,5764.592,I do support this amendment and hope to see it pass.,228,,
777,0.97,5764.592,5766.694,"Thank you, Councilmember Lewis.",229,,
778,0.97,5766.694,5767.461,Any other questions or comments?,229,,
779,0.97,5767.461,5774.368,So I just want to make sure that I understand.,230,,
780,0.97,5774.368,5795.389,"My concern with this is that these kinds of notices can be used for retaliation, for discrimination and there is already with the just cause law that we have, there is already a concern that these kinds of leases, these kinds of tools are tenants.",230,,
781,0.97,5795.389,5816.777,I keep coming back to the facts that the folks that are here have said them--it does not apply and Mallandlords are trying hard to make sure their tenants are able to stay and work out the situation that you have.,230,,
782,0.97,5816.777,5828.823,"So, I don't know how to enforce something this broad and the legislation that we have includes criminal activity as a reason that folks can be evicted.",230,,
783,0.97,5828.823,5831.625,So I am concerned about this amendment.,230,,
784,0.97,5831.625,5838.866,I don't think I will be supporting it.,230,,
785,0.97,5838.866,5841.435,"Thank you, Councilmember Morles.",231,,
786,0.97,5841.435,5843.704,Do you want to respond?,232,,
787,0.97,5843.704,5853.447,I just want to highlight this language establishes what the legal bar is.,233,,
788,0.97,5853.447,5856.083,It is an imminent threat and substantial detrimental impact.,233,,
789,0.97,5856.083,5871.999,This would be something that would have to be proven in court in order to be held up against a tenant's attempt to use the moratorium.,233,,
790,0.97,5871.999,5883.544,"So, a landlord would have to demonstrate that it is both substantial threat and the additional is imminent.",233,,
791,0.97,5883.544,5898.859,"These are not just random words, they are words that are established in case law and that I think bound really well the expectations that we have for protecting the safety of other tenants.",233,,
792,0.97,5898.859,5907.334,"Again, I just want to say this request has come from a provider of low income housing.",233,,
793,0.97,5907.334,5920.948,One of our nonprofit partners the request for this language and it does not extend the language.,233,,
794,0.97,5920.948,5921.482,Councilmember Sawant.,234,,
795,0.97,5921.482,5922.883,Thank you.,235,,
796,0.97,5922.883,5928.322,I also appreciate the intent of this amendment.,235,,
797,0.97,5928.322,5934.828,I have similar concerns as to what Councilmember Morales expressed.,235,,
798,0.97,5934.828,5959.887,"Making an exception, making it for criminal activity, if neighbors or building owners are put in danger if someone is cooking Meth in their apartment, shooting guns, something we all agree is extremely dangerous there is an exemption already in place.",235,,
799,0.97,5959.887,5986.113,"I understand the phrase substantial detrimental impact that we have, case background and I still don't think there are protections in place to make sure that there is such imminent damage that it will be covered already in that and the Eviction that will go through.",235,,
800,0.97,5986.113,5992.152,A landlord that wants to Evict a tenant will use any tools available to them.,235,,
801,0.97,5992.152,6031.392,"However they respond--how are they supposed to respond to claims that the tenant is having a substantial impact by attracting Vermen, hanging out with bad people, I am using these words because this is what tenants are being evicted because they are accused because they attracted that there is no way to prove they didn't.",235,,
802,0.97,6031.392,6038.265,It rules in a tenants absence.,235,,
803,0.97,6038.265,6038.799,Extreme power imbalance.,235,,
804,0.97,6038.799,6045.706,It is not a just cause that we modeled it after so.,235,,
805,0.97,6045.706,6052.479,Any more comments or questions on amendment number 4?,235,,
806,0.97,6052.479,6053.213,Seeing none.,236,,
807,0.97,6053.213,6071.598,"All of those voting to include number 4, raise your hand and vote.",236,,
808,0.97,6071.598,6071.865,Opposed.,236,,
809,0.97,6071.865,6072.065,Okay.,236,,
810,0.97,6072.065,6076.703,Councilmember Strauss would you like to speak to your amendment and move it.,237,,
811,0.97,6076.703,6076.97,Yes.,238,,
812,0.97,6076.97,6078.338,Narrows the no Eviction period.,238,,
813,0.97,6078.338,6082.876,I would like to move this amendment at this time.,238,,
814,0.97,6082.876,6083.177,Second.,239,,
815,0.97,6083.177,6086.647,Would you like to speak to it?,240,,
816,0.97,6086.647,6088.482,Yes.,241,,
817,0.97,6088.482,6089.45,Thank you very much.,241,,
818,0.97,6089.45,6094.922,It would reduce the period for Eviction to apply to 3 month period from December through February.,241,,
819,0.97,6094.922,6098.759,The three months that when the temperatures are the coldest.,241,,
820,0.97,6098.759,6111.038,I believe that the 3 months is a length of time.,241,,
821,0.97,6111.038,6119.346,It is used as a defense for the Eviction as we already from the plane small landlords who have come to testify and who have called.,241,,
822,0.97,6119.346,6133.06,"They are not the ones that are oftentimes most often Evicting people because the small landlords that I have had are always willing to pick up the phone, have a conversation and work with me.",241,,
823,0.97,6133.06,6140.267,"Again, this 3 month window is a time for the Eviction offense to apply rather than for half of the year.",241,,
824,0.97,6140.267,6153.614,And this 3 month period also Aligns to the recent changes in state law that allows a judge to require a 90 day payment plan before an Eviction Rite is issued.,241,,
825,0.97,6153.614,6162.99,"So, for those reasons and that December through March are the coldest months of the year and this is a winter Evictions bill and those are the winter months of the year.",241,,
826,0.97,6162.99,6168.595,That is why I move this amendment.,241,,
827,0.97,6168.595,6173.4,"Thank you Councilmember Strauss, anymore questions or comments?",242,,
828,0.97,6173.4,6173.934,Councilmember Sawant.,243,,
829,0.97,6173.934,6186.38,"So this bill would reduce the number of months of Eviction moratorium from 5 months to 3 months and right now, keeping in mind there is no winter protection at all.",244,,
830,0.97,6186.38,6197.758,If all we are able to do is ban the winter Evictions for the 3 months of the year there would be still a huge victory in Tnants rights.,244,,
831,0.97,6197.758,6211.238,"However, we worked with central staff to look at average monthly rainfall and cold temperatures and the data shows, again, for a Council that says they want to be data driven, the data shows the cold and wet months stretch from November to March.",244,,
832,0.97,6211.238,6220.213,If you are living in Seattle do you need to tell you that the cold months are from November through March?,244,,
833,0.97,6220.213,6225.452,I would like to point out that Alicia weren't you evicted on Halloween or just after Halloween?,244,,
834,0.97,6225.452,6225.686,Yes.,245,,
835,0.97,6225.686,6235.362,"So, you know f we reduce it to three months Alicia and people like her were evicted in early November would not be covered by this.",246,,
836,0.97,6235.362,6237.197,I am not sure what the logic is.,246,,
837,0.97,6237.197,6243.67,If we are going to do it why not cover it for the whole winter.,246,,
838,0.97,6243.67,6248.375,No logic behind it other than going to landlord lobby.,246,,
839,0.97,6248.375,6259.119,"So, I really think at the end of the day it comes down to as you have seen, it comes down to who politicians think they need to support and who they need to stand forward.",246,,
840,0.97,6259.119,6262.456,Most vulnerable or people who have everything and all of the power.,246,,
841,0.97,6262.456,6269.529,I will vote no on this amendment.,246,,
842,0.97,6269.529,6270.897,Any additional comments.,247,,
843,0.97,6270.897,6271.698,[crowd applauding],247,,
844,0.97,6271.698,6272.432,Councilmember Lewis?,248,,
845,0.97,6272.432,6278.171,"So, I am intend to vote for shortening the window for three months for a couple reasons.",249,,
846,0.97,6278.171,6301.261,"One of the reasons that--speaking for the same reasons that I spoke to amendment four, the more narrowly tailored it is, harder in court.",249,,
847,0.97,6301.261,6318.178,It say argument in obtaining this for challenge in state court and it is important to note after seeing a year after how a 90 day moratorium is we can entertain to extending it to five months.,249,,
848,0.97,6318.178,6322.349,I think that would be a natural evolution of there policy.,249,,
849,0.97,6322.349,6330.691,And for those reasons I am going to vote in favor of the amendment.,249,,
850,0.97,6330.691,6335.395,Thank you Councilmember Lewis.,250,,
851,0.97,6335.395,6336.196,Any other comments?,251,,
852,0.97,6336.196,6338.932,Any additional comments.,252,,
853,0.97,6338.932,6341.735,Seeing none.,253,,
854,0.97,6341.735,6353.847,All of those in favor of including Councilmember Strauss'Amendment vote and raise your hand.,253,,
855,0.97,6353.847,6355.082,Opposed.,253,,
856,0.97,6355.082,6355.282,Okay.,253,,
857,0.97,6355.282,6355.816,The amendment does hang.,253,,
858,0.97,6355.816,6358.018,Councilmember Strauss you have one more.,253,,
859,0.97,6358.018,6358.485,Thank you.,254,,
860,0.97,6358.485,6376.169,With the number of amendments in the nature of each amendment it demonstrates the need for further work to of occurred in committee.,254,,
861,0.97,6376.169,6380.974,And so I raise that today.,254,,
862,0.97,6380.974,6385.312,Amendment number 6 moves is to moderate household.,254,,
863,0.97,6385.312,6389.082,It has been moved and Seconded.,255,,
864,0.97,6389.082,6393.62,Councilmember Strauss would you like to speak on it.,255,,
865,0.97,6393.62,6400.427,As a Renter I understand what it looks like making rent every month.,256,,
866,0.97,6400.427,6403.93,And what the Economics are.,256,,
867,0.97,6403.93,6423.316,"My amendment number 6 will allow the Eviction to be used by moderate income households designed by 100% of the median or less it is $76,000 for an individual or $108,600 for a family of four.",256,,
868,0.97,6423.316,6435.495,"Data on rent burden households support this threshold, nearly half, 49.1% households at 50- 80% are rent burdened.",256,,
869,0.97,6435.495,6442.736,28.5 are 80-100% are rent burdened.,256,,
870,0.97,6442.736,6447.841,Only 4.8% of households over 100% median income are rent burdened.,256,,
871,0.97,6447.841,6464.324,This would ensure that households making more than 100% median income--it does not make sure it is just clear that households making that income are the least likely to become homeless as a result of an Eviction.,256,,
872,0.97,6464.324,6493.987,I think that it is very fortunate provide protections for tenants who are not at the highest levels of our economic spectrum and I want to ensure that this bill will not protect people who have the money without the--who are high earning but not followed up on their due diligence.,256,,
873,0.97,6493.987,6497.157,"Thank you, Councilmember Strauss?",257,,
874,0.97,6497.157,6497.991,Councilmember Sawant.,258,,
875,0.97,6497.991,6498.358,Thank you.,259,,
876,0.97,6498.358,6502.295,I appreciate on the comment about readiness of the legislation.,260,,
877,0.97,6502.295,6510.937,"I don't agree that the amendments, the slew of amendments demonstrates further work.",260,,
878,0.97,6510.937,6521.648,What it demonstrates is the landlord lobby has pull on the Council and demonstrates needing more powerful movement that is what it demonstrates.,260,,
879,0.97,6521.648,6522.282,[crowd applauding],260,,
880,0.97,6522.282,6532.025,This is another amendment that will make it far more difficult for Renters that need this the most to actually use them.,261,,
881,0.97,6532.025,6542.802,"The reality--this amendment says tenants household is moderate household defined and so on but the reality is the Renters who are being evicted are very, very low income people.",261,,
882,0.97,6542.802,6558.752,"Just a quote tenants Union who are at our committee table they said, the Eviction itself is a means tested process because it is--it is poor people who are getting impacted.",261,,
883,0.97,6558.752,6563.39,It is not opinion.,261,,
884,0.97,6563.39,6566.059,Look at the data.,261,,
885,0.97,6566.059,6575.368,"Find me another $130,000 salary earning person who was evicted that is how much Councilmembers make.",261,,
886,0.97,6575.368,6577.437,"I take home only $40,000.",261,,
887,0.97,6577.437,6580.507,"How many people make $130,000 are being evicted.",261,,
888,0.97,6580.507,6580.941,It does not exist.,261,,
889,0.97,6580.941,6587.514,"Again, it is all imaginary things that are pulled out of hat and say we need to make sure it does not happen.",261,,
890,0.97,6587.514,6591.151,There is not a great well off people being evicted.,261,,
891,0.97,6591.151,6592.152,It does not happen.,261,,
892,0.97,6592.152,6601.227,If it did the court would order the rich person to make up the winter months of rent.,261,,
893,0.97,6601.227,6607.834,If it does not exclude well off Renters who were excluded by paying rent I am not sure what it does.,261,,
894,0.97,6607.834,6609.603,Here is what it actually does.,261,,
895,0.97,6609.603,6616.443,What it will do and this is what means testing does in general.,261,,
896,0.97,6616.443,6618.878,Not the first means testing example.,261,,
897,0.97,6618.878,6629.289,It forces poor and working class people to jump through more hoops to get protection that was meant for them.,261,,
898,0.97,6629.289,6629.622,[crowd cheering],261,,
899,0.97,6632.359,6646.539,Without this amendment a judge could use this to avoid the Eviction of someone who failed up in court like so many desperate people who do not show up in court because they don't think the system will work because it does not work for them.,262,,
900,0.97,6646.539,6652.312,If this moratorium is a strong one even in the absence of tenants the tenant could be protected.,262,,
901,0.97,6652.312,6660.32,Imagine how much it would improve people's lives rather than sending them in a downward spiral.,262,,
902,0.97,6660.32,6666.159,With this amendment how would a judge determine Elegibility in a Renter's absence?,262,,
903,0.97,6666.159,6667.127,It would be impossible.,262,,
904,0.97,6667.127,6674.801,Means tests like this are well documented to limit the number of low income people who end Uptaking advantage of services.,262,,
905,0.97,6674.801,6688.715,"Nutritional program, there are tons of data to show that people don't end up--the pool of people who are eligible is bigger than the pool of people who take advantage of it.",262,,
906,0.97,6688.715,6690.583,"These are, again, also established fact.",262,,
907,0.97,6690.583,6691.051,Not my opinion.,262,,
908,0.97,6691.051,6705.732,"Locally there was an example when I first took office in 2014 we found out that discount program for the Seattle city light, supposed to give you subsidized rates that existed for years.",262,,
909,0.97,6705.732,6709.202,When we took office it was very sparsely used.,262,,
910,0.97,6709.202,6713.873,Only 18% of eligible people were using it.,262,,
911,0.97,6713.873,6714.074,Why?,262,,
912,0.97,6714.074,6716.109,Because it was an Opt-In program.,262,,
913,0.97,6716.109,6717.544,You had to show proof.,262,,

918,0.97,6765.258,6770.864,I know Councilmember Strauss presented one to be International clash day.,262,,

922,0.97,6785.178,6796.089,This--this is a reality people also--people because of means testing people who are eligible end up not using the program.,263,,
923,0.97,6796.089,6799.826,Not only because of the paperwork but because they feel humiliated.,263,,
924,0.97,6799.826,6803.096,It is not a question of Self- respect it is a question of your right.,263,,
925,0.97,6803.096,6808.201,"So, for that reason I will oppose this amendment.",263,,
926,0.97,6808.201,6808.568,[crowd applauding],263,,
927,0.97,6814.974,6816.276,Thank you Councilmember Sawant.,264,,

929,0.97,6820.28,6820.947,"Oh, here we go, guys.",266,,
930,0.97,6820.947,6828.421,It is that you have the right to free speech as long as you are not dumb enough not to use it.,267,,
931,0.97,6828.421,6834.394,I think that using free speech--it is a quote.,267,,
932,0.97,6834.394,6834.928,I do.,267,,
933,0.97,6834.928,6835.862,I absolutely do.,267,,
934,0.97,6835.862,6839.199,It was supposed to be ironic.,268,,
935,0.97,6839.199,6846.339,I understand that and appreciate everyone coming to Council today to use their right to free speech.,268,,
936,0.97,6846.339,6856.583,And so I also my point of returning this comment is just to say that this is also not an asset means test it is just simply income.,268,,
937,0.97,6856.583,6862.789,I took that comment to be Self-Reflecting not on any other Councilmember that is the way I took it.,269,,
938,0.97,6862.789,6863.056,Yes.,270,,
939,0.97,6863.056,6866.826,That did not go well.,270,,
940,0.97,6866.826,6873.466,I will call on Councilmember Herbold and appreciate all of the good opinions expressed.,271,,
941,0.97,6873.466,6874.167,Thank you.,272,,
942,0.97,6874.167,6892.418,Before I get to my substance of my comments about this particular amendment I do want to speak to something that I am sure that Councilmember Sawant did not mean as I heard it but I want to clarify it for the public.,272,,
943,0.97,6892.418,6900.96,Referenced what would happen if a tenant did not show up to court and how would a judge know what somebody's income was?,272,,
944,0.97,6900.96,6915.808,Even with passage of this law a tenant will still have to show up because not showing up and speaking to this as a just cause will limit their ability to use it as a defense.,272,,
945,0.97,6915.808,6927.42,"Even using this ordinance that we are poised to vote on, still require tenants to show up in court if an Eviction is filed.",272,,
946,0.97,6927.42,6937.463,I think that is really important within the context of us all knowing our rights.,272,,
947,0.97,6937.463,6937.93,Please continue.,273,,
948,0.97,6937.93,6948.041,"As it relates specifically to the question of means testing, the utility discount program has been brought up a few times.",274,,
949,0.97,6948.041,6952.345,You do have to income qualify to participate in the program.,274,,
950,0.97,6952.345,6962.655,"And, I think utilities are actually a good example for the situation.",274,,
951,0.97,6962.655,6968.227,Some of our largest most profitable companies are also some of the folks who have the largest unpaid utility bills.,274,,
952,0.97,6968.227,6970.663,And it is not because they don't have the money to do it.,274,,
953,0.97,6970.663,6975.702,They want to pay it when they are ready to pay it.,274,,
954,0.97,6975.702,6995.121,"So, I am actually supportive of this amendment because I don't want folks of means to just decide Yeah, I can pay this in five months if I want and in the meantime members of our small landlord community are left holding the bag.",274,,
955,0.97,6995.121,6996.989,They might get the money.,274,,
956,0.97,6996.989,6999.192,They might get the money after five months.,274,,
957,0.97,6999.192,7009.736,"I think that will actually have a negative impact on some small landlords because sometimes people with a lot of money do not pay their bills, also.",274,,
958,0.97,7009.736,7025.018,We know now from the analysis that the Councilmember has done that there are few people who would be above this income threshold for that reason I support this amendment.,274,,
959,0.97,7025.018,7025.852,Councilmember Sawant.,275,,
960,0.97,7025.852,7033.292,"Just one sentence to talk about the program, the making it opt out made a difference.",276,,
961,0.97,7033.292,7038.231,"For example, one example, I don't have time to go through the whole thing.",276,,
962,0.97,7038.231,7043.136,We were able to because of changing it from Opt-In and Opt- out.,276,,
963,0.97,7043.136,7048.775,"We were able to Enrole residents, a big example how --",276,,
964,0.97,7048.775,7051.344,Property income eligible.,277,,
965,0.97,7051.344,7051.577,Yes.,278,,
966,0.97,7051.577,7051.911,Exactly.,279,,
967,0.97,7051.911,7058.351,Okay thank you Councilmember Sawant and you all for the explanation here.,280,,
968,0.97,7058.351,7059.285,And thank you Pedersen.,280,,
969,0.97,7059.285,7060.42,Any other questions or comments.,280,,
970,0.97,7060.42,7066.526,We are going to call for the vote.,280,,

972,0.97,7071.664,7080.807,The amendment does hang and we will look at the bill as amended.,280,,

974,0.97,7091.951,7101.727,My desire Council colleagues it got on Council because it will be a policy win for the folks you have been working with Renters Commission and tenant rights folks.,280,,
975,0.97,7101.727,7112.038,I know this bill has an amended and I appreciate Council colleagues to have amendments but it is important to close it out as what it will mean to working families.,280,,
976,0.97,7112.038,7113.172,Thank you.,281,,
977,0.97,7113.172,7120.913,"I agree with you, there is going to be historic legislation.",281,,
978,0.97,7120.913,7129.856,I am--I have not made any--I have not disguised my disappointment with the loopholes that have been put in.,281,,
979,0.97,7129.856,7139.265,I think the ultimately--what it demonstrates is that--the need for it.,281,,
980,0.97,7139.265,7144.971,Highlight that we are discussing this legislation and voting it out does show how much people have done.,281,,
981,0.97,7144.971,7150.943,And I wanted to thank everybody who is here and also everybody who spent months advocating for this.,281,,
982,0.97,7150.943,7163.89,Renters Commission but I want to mention among the people we have here are the activists who were involved in the India resolution and they can be involved in more than one thing but our community as a whole.,281,,
983,0.97,7163.89,7169.896,I think it is important that we are bringing immigrant communities together.,281,,
984,0.97,7169.896,7181.207,I specifically wanted to highlight the Washington community action network and housing justice project for all of the work they have been doing for years because of whom we are at this stage.,281,,
985,0.97,7181.207,7197.39,"And I think at the end of the day, what we have, what we will have achieved for the legislation if it is voted through is landmark legislation that has no precedent in the country and in fact, little in the world.",281,,
986,0.97,7197.39,7201.794,As far as we know only country of France has something similar.,281,,
987,0.97,7201.794,7202.228,So this is huge.,281,,
988,0.97,7202.228,7209.735,I think we should be proud of our movement for this.,281,,
989,0.97,7209.735,7216.676,"I thank Councilmembers for, assuming Councilmembers will be voting yes--I am speaking in Dvanced.",281,,
990,0.97,7216.676,7221.747,But quickly I want to say we need to be sober about the limitations of it.,281,,
991,0.97,7221.747,7224.45,It will not end Evictions it will delay them.,281,,
992,0.97,7224.45,7232.758,We know delaying will provide a lifeline and potentially prevent convictions but on a whole it will not be enough.,281,,
993,0.97,7232.758,7242.868,We do need rent control and we need major expansion of social housing so we can't stop fighting.,281,,
994,0.97,7242.868,7246.672,[crowd applauding].,281,,

1013,0.97,7398.29,7405.998,"In March, just a little bit more than a month away, negotiations for a new agreement will begin for a new contract.",285,,
1014,0.97,7405.998,7421.013,The code requires the city Council to hold a public hearing in advance of the commencement of negotiations with the police officers Guild and requires the city to consider in good faith when and how to carry the interest expressed at the public hearing.,285,,
1015,0.97,7421.013,7452.344,"It does not exist for any other bargaining unit in the city or for any other contract requirement in the city as it relates to other city employees, only exists for police accountability and for the police officer's Guild because of the prior Council has identified this as being such an important issue that we need to hear from the public before we enter into negotiations.",285,,
1016,0.97,7452.344,7461.587,And it is intended to bring a amount of transparency to the process before we actually begin the process.,285,,
1017,0.97,7461.587,7472.097,So we all have heard you both in the public hearing but we acted or about to act on a resolution that identifies what the priorities are.,285,,
1018,0.97,7472.097,7481.507,"And, by us identifying what the priorities are Y'all can hold us more accountable when we are on the other end of the negotiating session.",285,,

1023,0.97,7549.008,7553.178,And I believe the legislation itself speaks for itself as far as what the priorities.,285,,
1024,0.97,7553.178,7564.757,I am happy to take a minute to talk about them but otherwise I don't think we need to talk about them because they are in attachments.,285,,
