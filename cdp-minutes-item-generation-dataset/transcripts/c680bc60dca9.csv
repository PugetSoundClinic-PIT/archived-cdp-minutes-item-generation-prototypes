9,0.97,73.673,74.474,I will make sure to announce that.,1,,
10,0.97,74.474,82.882,I want to note at the top of the hour we do have Interpreters with us.,1,,
11,0.97,82.882,84.417,They will be offering translation.,1,,
12,0.97,84.417,89.956,This includes translating my opening remarks and the instruct ships for facilitating the public comment.,1,,
13,0.97,89.956,98.298,"I want to make sure to slow down, they have been provided the script in front of us for the opening comments here.",1,,
14,0.97,98.298,101.534,But this will give everyone the opportunity for translation.,1,,
15,0.97,101.534,111.144,We are going to start with these opening comments and we will have a break at each sentence to make sure to offer translation services.,1,,
16,0.97,111.144,123.089,We will be offering it in Spanish and we to have instructions for folks that have a need for additional translation services in future meetings.,1,,
17,0.97,123.089,123.289,Okay.,1,,
18,0.97,123.289,132.966,Colleagues today we have a number of Interpreters joining us to provide translation for members of the public that requested translation for Spanish.,1,,
19,0.97,132.966,140.24,They will be translating opening remarks and directions on how to moderate today's public hearing.,1,,

22,0.97,158.124,158.391,Madam clerk.,1,,
23,0.97,165.798,190.823,I'll will continue to read my comment because the Translators have been offered these in writing and we will review them in Spanish when they do get on the line but I will stick to the script.,1,,
24,0.97,190.823,205.738,[speaking Spanish] for future language access requests for the budget committee please make sure to contact my office 72 hours in advance of the committee meeting to submit your requests for translation.,1,,
25,0.97,205.738,218.017,Colleagues we have today almost 200 participants signed up and we know that it is important for them to hear directly and for us to hear directly from constituents as we build the budget.,1,,
26,0.97,218.017,236.636,Like you I heard from folks before we began to receive the Mayor's proposed budget that were interested in providing information to us about what was going to be included in the Mayor's transmitted budget.,1,,
27,0.97,236.636,249.449,It is not and can't be the case that each Council budget process is the first time that we hear from constituents advocate and deliberate in public what people value at the table.,1,,
28,0.97,249.449,255.421,So transparency and accountability and good government mean the Council process has to be more than checking an executive process box.,1,,
29,0.97,255.421,260.693,That is why we hold public comments like this but it is not the only time.,1,,
30,0.97,260.693,264.697,Councilmembers have the chance to engage with constituents.,1,,
31,0.97,264.697,282.382,I very much appreciate how many Councilmembers have flagged the way in which your offices have been engaging constituents and advocates and look forward for you engaged in providing comment to all of us in addition to these public hearings offered today.,1,,

44,0.97,403.069,423.489,Before I turn it over to see what you have to offer I will do my best to translate this in Spanish.,1,,
45,0.97,423.489,571.871,[speaking Spanish] affordable if anybody else has anything to add I know Council President Gonzelez you would have done a much better translating that and we are trying to get the translator services on the line.,1,,

835,0.97,5913.741,5916.51,Billionaires have gotten trillions with the pandemic and that's 68% increase.,152,,
836,0.97,5916.51,5949.643,I don't know about others but my income has not gone up by 68% and thousands of struggling with rents and at the same time others have mentioned with environmental crisis and it is totally unacceptable given the needs of our community that Mayor Durkan's budget proposal cuts one hundred million from the Amazon tax and funds for affordable housing and creating new programs and I support the people's budget and stand in solidarity with the plan.,152,,
837,0.97,5949.643,5969.463,We need to reject the Mayor's choice and Council has to increase the Amazon tax by $120 million and the Council can add money for housing including the expansion of tiny House villages by rejecting Mayor Durkan's expansion of the Seattle budget and it is $13 million --,152,,
