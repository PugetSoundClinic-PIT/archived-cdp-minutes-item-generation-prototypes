71,0.97,529.428,536.035,"Yet, this bill makes it harder for the public to understand comments and track the big market rate projects that affect thousands of people that are now being reviewed behind closed doors.",16,,
72,0.97,536.035,551.551,I think it has been to just that the public might have more input but I don't see that in my dealings of busy planners and the time that is paid for by developers and the number one job is to work with them to push a project across the finish line.,16,,
73,0.97,551.551,553.986,Calls and Emails with planners is not something that is commonly done.,16,,
74,0.97,553.986,567.4,"The bill seems to be another step in the brand bargain and four years since it was enacted, developers have Productively chosen to pay in the rather than build affordable housing.",16,,
75,0.97,567.4,570.136,I understand this model creates pressure to approve unsustainable designs.,16,,
76,0.97,570.136,578.144,It doesn't welcome public input and neighbors a call for mitigation are often viewed as obstructionist.,16,,
77,0.97,578.144,590.122,"We know last time we spoke of this, a lot of the comments to make this a permanent system.",16,,
78,0.97,590.122,592.858,I think we need to take a step back and reintroduce public comments.,16,,
79,0.97,592.858,595.428,"When the bill was passed, the Councilmembers asked for a progress report.",16,,
80,0.97,595.428,606.439,We are asking today to have central staff on what the progress is and when will the virtual Online meetings become reality as they have for all the other departments?,16,,

89,0.97,670.77,691.724,"If you go down queen and look at a number of projects that have been developed, you would see courtyards and infrastructure that was inspired by public comment and meetings.",18,,
90,0.97,691.724,707.74,We are currently working on a huge Safeway development that we worked on with hundreds of people and thousands of hours I have gone into this with four different developers and now we are getting to a place where it is getting ready to go in for permit.,18,,
91,0.97,707.74,711.21,You will take away the right for public to me on this?,18,,
92,0.97,711.21,724.223,"For over two decades, the current designer has allowed people to input or public input on neighborhood decisions and outcomes will impact and change the communities.",18,,
93,0.97,724.223,734.467,This reflects the city council commitment to listen to and represent all the constituent opinions together specific neighborhoods and goals and objectives.,18,,
94,0.97,734.467,739.071,"With all due respect, these meetings and the design is wrong.",18,,
95,0.97,739.071,739.672,Let's be honest.,18,,

98,0.97,765.998,766.665,This is intentional.,18,,
99,0.97,766.665,767.066,Why not?,18,,
100,0.97,767.066,775.407,"We all know for decades, developers have lobbied City Hall and streamlined permitting.",18,,
101,0.97,775.407,789.755,Design review and many other neighborhoods are determined by performance and speed and city hall insiders rather than respectful neighborhoods.,18,,
102,0.97,789.755,800.132,Some believe he may be using nurse's Ascension as a first step to eliminate the review altogether.,18,,
103,0.97,800.132,808.807,"This would be a huge mistake and otherwise, why not migrate design review Online like most other institutions --",18,,
104,0.97,808.807,812.144,"Thank you, Martin.",19,,
105,0.97,812.144,822.688,"Samantha share, are you present?",19,,

132,0.97,1000.632,1006.138,"I just wanted to inquire, Mr.",29,,
133,0.97,1006.138,1034.666,Chairman if you know at this point where we are or if we can follow up off-line when we passed the legislation granting as PCI the ability to do administrative review or no review in some cases and we requested and to keep the committee a prize with virtual meetings.,29,,
134,0.97,1034.666,1047.179,I believe we are supposed to get a report back from the Department and I wanted to inquire about the progress was.,29,,
135,0.97,1047.179,1063.662,I know that is critical for Úmyself and some of our colleagues in voting to grant a unique and extraordinary concession for the Department to meet the needs at the moment.,29,,
136,0.97,1063.662,1078.076,It is a temporary policy that should not be considered to be permanent or a step in the direction towards permanent suspension.,29,,
137,0.97,1078.076,1089.421,I did want to see where we were in that process in dealing with the technical hurdles and when we can expect that report back.,29,,

142,0.97,1118.484,1127.826,We will be following up because I like you wanted to have that as part of this bill and I would be interested and I'm waiting to hear myself what the status is.,32,,
143,0.97,1127.826,1164.596,"Councilmember Strauss, did the bill itself Enumerate a deadline and I'm not asking that to be tricky or Rhetorical but actually asking because I don't have the bill in front of me but I thought it did have a deadline and I'm just curious if the report is to meet that deadline or if we have extended or if they have requested an extension just in the interest of being fully transparent.",33,,
144,0.97,1164.596,1177.175,I'm curious if that is the case and asking just to Reflash my own recollection but I thought it had been 15 June or something like that.,33,,
145,0.97,1177.175,1182.281,If someone could refresh my recollection on that.,33,,
