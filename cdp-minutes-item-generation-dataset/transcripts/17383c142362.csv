50,0.97,327.927,333.666,Last week's Verdes in this George Floyd case was some small measure of accountability.,15,,
51,0.97,333.666,354.52,"If it is to have meeting beyond the events of one day in one city, we must all demand accountability for police killings on other days in other cities and demand with systems of accountability that don't rely on police murders becoming a national celebrity in order to achieve accountability.",15,,
52,0.97,354.52,382.849,"Resulting in the murders of Jack Hewing tin, and others, Michael Taylor--Danny Rodriguez, these were mostly people of color killed by the SPD under conditions where they had a knife, a bottle or no weapon.",15,,
53,0.97,382.849,391.791,Most experienced a severe mental health crisis.,15,,
54,0.97,391.791,403.369,"The absolute minimum level of accountability would cause us to reconsider a police accountability system that Rubberstamps these murders as justified and, quote, within policy.",15,,
55,0.97,403.369,407.073,"Is your unquestioned belief that our police accountability system works, resulting in an even deeper level of Unaccountability?",15,,
56,0.97,407.073,416.849,We need a full civilian control beyond the current system of police investigating police.,15,,
57,0.97,416.849,424.157,"It's happening in other cities in Nashville, Portland, Oregon and why not here?",15,,
58,0.97,424.157,424.457,Thank you.,15,,

64,0.97,476.943,487.787,We have set the Timer for five minutes before this group.,18,,
65,0.97,487.787,490.99,Would you like me to begin?,19,,
66,0.97,490.99,510.509,I'm a resident of district 4 and a medical researcher in Seattle and I'm here to represent the group that seeks to have a local law enforcement priority with protections for medical practitioners.,19,,
67,0.97,510.509,515.248,Many are wary of pursuing and progressing with drug law performed with the Regressive continuation.,19,,
68,0.97,515.248,535.768,The city of Seattle would pass a resolution to Decriminalize and protect medical practitioners who prescribed them to demonstrate there is a public appetite for change.,19,,
69,0.97,535.768,540.373,"The organizations are endorsing global medical practitioners, indigenous Healers and local Democrats within the city of Seattle that we have spoken with.",19,,
70,0.97,540.373,557.823,"Personally, I'd treat substance abuse and Ptsd, unparalleled, and the city of Seattle should join Washington, D.C., Oakland and Denver in passing these reforms and I will pass it to the next Speaker.",19,,
71,0.97,557.823,558.124,Thank you.,19,,
72,0.97,558.124,558.491,Thank you.,20,,
73,0.97,558.491,566.265,I motion that we extend this a little bit.,21,,
74,0.97,566.265,571.871,We were under the impression that it was two minutes each.,21,,
75,0.97,571.871,582.682,I live in district 3 and I'm a union Organizer and I speak to as part of the resolution 2d criminalize Psychedelics in Seattle.,21,,
76,0.97,582.682,583.749,My own experience with Psilocybin is why I'm here.,21,,
77,0.97,583.749,594.827,It shuts off your ego and is important because the negative voice telling you you can't and you are not worthy and will never overcome this disappears entirely.,21,,
78,0.97,594.827,607.073,"When I take small amounts of Psilocybin, it feels like my brain can think clearly about the obstacles in front of me without distraction.",21,,
79,0.97,607.073,614.914,"I've been able to work through depression, even though I have workplace anxiety and it has allowed me to excel in my career.",21,,
80,0.97,614.914,619.619,Wouldn't you want to open up your consciousness to champion your Insecurities?,21,,
81,0.97,619.619,624.824,"I'm not saying Psilocybin will cure your problems, but it helped me work through mine.",21,,
82,0.97,624.824,634.8,"We are prohibited to study and make use of this for health purposes, but they are Criminalized in the same class as drugs like Methamphetamine.",21,,
83,0.97,634.8,640.339,There are five studies in one state Decriminalizing the use of Psychedelics.,21,,
84,0.97,640.339,646.879,Why haven't we move forward to abandon the archaic and outdated drug laws that fill prisons and ruin lives.,21,,
85,0.97,646.879,647.813,Seattle can do better and I yield my time.,21,,
86,0.97,647.813,657.456,"Next Speaker, please?",22,,
87,0.97,657.456,660.459,I believe that is me.,23,,
88,0.97,660.459,684.984,"I'm a resident of district 2 and one of the comments that I want to make on what it is we are trying to do, we are looking to Decriminalize Psychedelics, particularly because of the benefits they offer for human health and wellness.",23,,
89,0.97,684.984,702.635,"If we don't take action to Decriminalize growing, gathering and Gifting in our community, it will be perpetuated with health care that is only available to people who can afford it with opportunities mostly available to people who can afford it.",23,,
90,0.97,702.635,711.31,"For folks who can't, they suffer longer and with greater disparities.",23,,
91,0.97,711.31,717.283,"Overdose deaths, suicide and depression and anxiety are skyrocketing and are exacerbated by Covid.",23,,
92,0.97,717.283,723.355,Our communities deserve the reliable treatments and plant medicine is one of the most accessible forms because people can literally grow their medicine.,23,,
93,0.97,723.355,745.411,"Just like Seattle with the weed to divert the citizens substance use disorders that are struggling with the justice system, or sedan representatives have an opportunity to keep Proactive and to try something different and to stand with other communities across the nation trying something different.",23,,
94,0.97,745.411,746.946,"The evidence, both scientific and anecdotal are supportive of this.",23,,
95,0.97,746.946,758.491,I will yield the rest of my time.,23,,
96,0.97,762.895,773.272,"Gail, are you with us?",24,,
97,0.97,776.041,776.542,Perhaps Jackson Holbert?,24,,
98,0.97,776.542,776.775,Yes.,25,,
99,0.97,776.775,777.109,I can speak.,25,,
100,0.97,777.109,777.309,Yes.,25,,
101,0.97,777.309,798.33,"Many years ago, I had a personal Trans figurative experience with Psilocybin mushrooms that relieved a period of severe depression . I remember getting on the phone with my mother a couple of days after my experience and having her demand to know what had happened to me.",25,,
102,0.97,798.33,800.299,"You sound different, she said.",25,,
103,0.97,800.299,801.2,You sound better.,25,,
104,0.97,801.2,808.707,She had been worried about me and those worries had been justified . I hadn't had anything positive to say for months.,25,,
105,0.97,808.707,814.98,I couldn't appreciate the world around me or myself but I couldn't see a future.,25,,
106,0.97,814.98,819.785,"My psychological trajectory was bleak and one autumn evening, I ate a small handful of dried mushrooms and had an experience.",25,,
107,0.97,819.785,827.793,Thank you for those comments.,26,,
108,0.97,827.793,829.228,"If there are other comments from this group, please send them on.",26,,
109,0.97,829.228,839.738,Our next Speaker is BJ last.,26,,
110,0.97,841.006,841.106,Bj?,26,,
111,0.97,841.106,866.365,"My name is BJ last and I'm a Ballard restaurant owner and for the budget Reviser to transfer the 2021 salary savings for Participatory budgeting, with the SPD staffing report showing as PD will have between $11.5 million and $13 million in salary savings this year.",27,,
112,0.97,866.365,873.005,That's more than enough to cover the proviso in the $4.5 million of overtime overruns.,27,,
113,0.97,873.005,874.707,Now is the time to take action.,27,,
114,0.97,874.707,878.911,Counsel can continue to sit around and wait for the monitor to Weigh-In.,27,,
115,0.97,878.911,884.717,We are one-third of the way through the year with no action being taken.,27,,
116,0.97,884.717,889.588,Budget oversight is the role of the Council and is the best way to create public safety.,27,,
117,0.97,889.588,893.292,The police don't create public safety.,27,,
118,0.97,893.292,899.098,No one moves to a neighborhood because it has a high police presence.,27,,
119,0.97,899.098,904.003,"In areas with the most police presence, they aren't considered the safest.",27,,
120,0.97,904.003,918.918,Participatory budgeting is the best way to do that and if you questions for the overtime Categorizations in that tier 1 staffing and budget report.,27,,
121,0.97,918.918,926.825,"With over time for protest response and events, 2120 was mostly pretty Covid with a normal event schedule with new year's and other events and there hadn't been any special events this year.",27,,
122,0.97,926.825,936.602,It seems like Lumping them together is an attempt by SPD do to minimize the amount of spending on overtime to respond to protests.,27,,
123,0.97,936.602,938.971,"Also, what falls under miscellaneous?",27,,
124,0.97,938.971,948.08,That's the biggest bucket and seems like a way for as PD to hide what it has been spending his overtime hours on.,27,,
125,0.97,948.08,951.65,"Transferring the savings to Participatory budgeting to create public safety, thank you and I yield my time.",27,,
126,0.97,951.65,957.856,Thank you.,28,,
127,0.97,957.856,963.228,Our next Speaker is showing not present and we will move to the next Speaker.,28,,
128,0.97,963.228,964.463,Our next Speaker is --,28,,
129,0.97,964.463,968.267,Hello?,29,,
130,0.97,968.267,978.811,You just told me to Unmute.,30,,
131,0.97,982.047,985.951,Go ahead.,31,,
132,0.97,985.951,995.661,I'm a resident of district 5 and a member of the black action coalition.,32,,
133,0.97,995.661,1005.838,I noticed that Councilmember Herbold has a black lives matter sign in her property.,32,,
134,0.97,1005.838,1018.617,This institution has been brutalized in the city and I'm a Third-Generation black woman and I'm asking the city Council to pass the original version of the amendment to reduce the SPD budget by the full $5.4 million.,32,,
135,0.97,1018.617,1028.627,These funds should be allocated to Participatory budgeting.,32,,
136,0.97,1028.627,1034.666,"The SPD overtime was used to respond to protesters marching in defense of black lives, infamous for violence and they should not have been awarded these resources.",32,,
137,0.97,1034.666,1043.842,We need budget accountability.,32,,
138,0.97,1043.842,1057.89,Spd has a long history of overtime and a history of overtime fraud and continuing to facilitate growth in the overtime budget is fiscally responsible and shows the black community that you simply do not care.,32,,
139,0.97,1057.89,1073.906,"Last year, city council made a commitment to shift resources from SPD to community solutions and part of the commitment was resolution 119862, to not grant additional funding to cover excess overtime.",32,,
140,0.97,1073.906,1102.234,"Spd defied the resolution to ask city council for more money, which they granted the additional funds via 126-1572 reduce the 2021 budget by at least $5.2 million per the city council needs to honor the commitment to the people of Seattle and hold SPD accountable by rejecting the amendment of the 119-8912 reduce the SPD 2021 budget by the full $5.4 million.",32,,
141,0.97,1102.234,1107.306,We need police budget accountability now.,32,,
142,0.97,1107.306,1117.316,Anything less than $5.4 million is a slap in the face of the black community lives.,32,,
143,0.97,1117.316,1117.783,"If you do, prove it.",32,,
144,0.97,1117.783,1122.254,The next Speaker is Jackson holder.,33,,
145,0.97,1122.254,1126.325,Jackson spoke with the group.,34,,
146,0.97,1126.325,1127.025,Sure enough.,35,,
147,0.97,1127.025,1131.497,Thank you for the reminder.,35,,
148,0.97,1131.497,1136.235,Next Speaker listed is Dan otter.,35,,
149,0.97,1136.235,1140.839,I do not see Dan present.,35,,
150,0.97,1140.839,1150.849,"We will go to Peter, next.",35,,
151,0.97,1150.849,1154.953,Hello.,36,,
152,0.97,1154.953,1156.889,Good morning and thank you for the opportunity to speak this morning.,36,,
153,0.97,1156.889,1163.095,I live in district 6 and I'm a health care provider.,36,,
154,0.97,1163.095,1171.336,I've grappled with depression for my entire life and spent 30 years in and out of therapy and on Medications.,36,,
155,0.97,1171.336,1174.206,It kept me from suicide but I'm still depressed.,36,,
156,0.97,1174.206,1184.349,My adult children also suffer from anxiety and depression and have not benefited much from traditional talk therapy and Medications.,36,,
157,0.97,1184.349,1189.521,I believe they and many like them should have access to new treatments utilizing Psychedelic substances.,36,,
158,0.97,1189.521,1196.495,"Indeed, one of my sons work with an underground therapist last year using Mdma and really benefited from it.",36,,
159,0.97,1196.495,1206.605,"He was able to find an inner part of himself he had no clue existed and used it to make gains in the past year, advancing in his job and personal life.",36,,
160,0.97,1206.605,1216.315,"The roadblocks, if removed, more would benefit without risking a prison sentence.",36,,
161,0.97,1216.315,1224.156,"Professionally, I often see patients who have success in managing chronic pain that is impeded by anxiety, depression and Ptsd.",36,,
162,0.97,1224.156,1228.493,It's hard to witness their suffering and sometimes very hard to help them.,36,,
163,0.97,1228.493,1239.605,I love to be able to refer them to a qualified therapist who could offer Psychedelic assisted therapy is one of their options.,36,,
164,0.97,1239.605,1244.776,Decriminalizing these substances in Seattle would be an important step in this direction.,36,,
165,0.97,1244.776,1257.389,Humans have used mind altering substances for millennia and only in the last 50 years have we've been denied access to things nature provides that can benefit us psychologically and spiritually.,36,,
166,0.97,1257.389,1262.561,"Before outlet, research showed a path for healing pain, stress and addiction.",36,,
167,0.97,1262.561,1269.101,It's time to end this senseless denial and I urge the Seattle Soncy Council to pass a resolution to Decriminalize nature in our great city.,36,,
168,0.97,1269.101,1269.401,Thank you.,36,,

172,0.97,1294.259,1305.671,I'm a public health nurse in my masters research centered around harm reduction and safer use of substances.,38,,
173,0.97,1305.671,1323.989,"Through that research, it became quite clear that whatever potential Harms any substance can cause to an individual, those Harms are dramatically magnified by the policies that criminalize possession and use of that substance.",38,,
174,0.97,1323.989,1334.733,"Our policy is to Decriminalize use, much more harmful than the drugs, themselves.",38,,
175,0.97,1334.733,1335.901,Particularly the case with Psychedelics.,38,,
176,0.97,1335.901,1344.142,They pose minimal health risks and have a pretty good safety Profile.,38,,
177,0.97,1344.142,1349.314,"You know, compared to other illicit drugs and even legal drugs like alcohol and nicotine.",38,,
178,0.97,1349.314,1362.828,"Not only are Psychedelics relatively safe, but the potential they hold the treatment of mental illness is immense and the improvement of the quality of life is great.",38,,
179,0.97,1362.828,1370.569,"Criminalization inhibits that potential and we don't even know what that potential is, because of Criminalization.",38,,
180,0.97,1370.569,1378.243,"In closing, I invite all of you Council members to think about why Psychedelics are criminalize?",38,,
181,0.97,1378.243,1387.085,What is the rationale behind that and whether those policies have achieved their goals and whether they've improved our society.,38,,

195,0.97,1440.605,1446.945,"The Criminalization of drugs was not made to benefit the lives of citizens, nor did it do so.",42,,
196,0.97,1446.945,1452.517,The laws were enacted out of fear to criminalize specific groups of people.,42,,
197,0.97,1452.517,1463.595,"These substances have been more a less Slandered into being considered something for Delusional psychotic Hippies to get high, rather than help and functioning citizens make their lives more pleasant.",42,,

206,0.97,1517.015,1519.351,Almost everyone knows someone who struggles with addiction.,42,,
207,0.97,1519.351,1527.459,"Ask yourselves, do these fellow citizens deserve to be put behind bars and should they be scared to go to the hospital when the Overdose?",42,,
208,0.97,1527.459,1532.23,Should they not have access to pure substances but scores smack off the street that kills them?,42,,

224,0.97,1626.591,1643.041,My name is Julia Buck and I'm a resident of district 6. I'm calling to urge the Council to practice fiscal responsibility with regards to the Seattle police Department budget.,47,,
225,0.97,1643.041,1672.804,There is a positive correlation studied and put forth by King County that additional police overtime leads to a higher rate of incidents of police brutality for the Seattle police Department's overtime has been a source of unaccountable spending and there have been far fewer events in the first quarter of the year and the Department overtime spending should be reduced for $5.4 million to Participatory budgeting.,47,,
226,0.97,1672.804,1686.785,"If police presence were correlated with safety, every one in Seattle would want to live in the areas with the highest police presence.",47,,
227,0.97,1686.785,1688.553,"Instead, the areas with the highest police presence are considered the most dangerous.",47,,
228,0.97,1688.553,1692.424,That has been a consistent state of affairs.,47,,
229,0.97,1692.424,1703.935,"So, please reduce the SPD budget by $5.4 million and send that money to Participatory budgeting.",47,,
230,0.97,1703.935,1704.803,Thank you so much and I yield my time.,47,,

236,0.97,1724.689,1764.062,"I'm an abolitionist and District 4 and her in mind the public safety and human services committee that SPD brutalized protesters Lester and is perpetrated decades of violence against our black and Brown neighbors . The amended version of the Council bill 119981 gives SPD over $8 million for new expenditures and those are overtime dollars and salary savings at City Council promised to community by Participatory budgeting last year, and giving the money back would reward them for their violent 2020 tactics and encourage more of it in the future.",49,,
237,0.97,1764.062,1773.538,It's clear from the presentation today that SPD does not made the money and are projected to have over $11.5 million in 2021 salary savings.,49,,
238,0.97,1773.538,1780.845,This means you can and should Defund SPD by that amount and they would not even feel the cut.,49,,
239,0.97,1780.845,1790.155,Council should immediately move to transfer the savings to Participatory budgeting where they stand the best chance of being used to create true public safety.,49,,
240,0.97,1790.155,1795.226,Council cannot sit on the sidelines and wait endlessly for the consent decree monitor.,49,,
241,0.97,1795.226,1804.602,The budget oversight is your role and you are well within your power to transfer budget savings from SPD to Participatory budgeting.,49,,
242,0.97,1804.602,1805.17,Do the right thing.,49,,
243,0.97,1805.17,1806.504,Black lives matter.,49,,

249,0.97,1825.924,1849.013,"Sexual assault has become the number one crisis for homeless women, with Meth, crack and heroin pushers destroying lives daily and exempted from jail by Council, the Mayor, the Prosecutor's offices but the only effort we see with the public safety is running interference for criminals to make sure it's safe for them to make their money.",51,,
250,0.97,1849.013,1854.519,"As long as they pay their rent, it's all good for the bank donors and the Democrats.",51,,
251,0.97,1854.519,1861.559,You need a weapon or two to survive anywhere near third Avenue in the bus stops throughout the city.,51,,
252,0.97,1861.559,1878.843,We have 911 dispatch used by the police chief as a propaganda tool to demand more money from taxpayers when they call about an emergency crisis and then 911 dispatch refuses to send cops but starts finding excuses for a criminal defense lawyer who took a racist professors criminal justice class.,51,,
253,0.97,1878.843,1898.896,"Yesterday, a fight broke out between two competing drug pushing prostitutes, spring large canisters of bear spray in between pine and Pike on third Avenue at the bus stop, resulting in over 20 people on the sidewalk throwing up, blinded and gagging for air.",51,,
254,0.97,1898.896,1902.5,This is the same bus stop Council and staff spent $1 million breaking out.,51,,
255,0.97,1902.5,1909.907,"One bus stop to make three bus stops, bragging about the criminal activities.",51,,

262,0.97,1937.235,1952.717,"I'm here to demand accountability for victims of police accountability, not just for Minneapolis and across the country, but for people from Seattle.",53,,
263,0.97,1952.717,1970.735,"When we talk about Defunding the police and the promises made over the summer, those promises now have to be followed through with most of the money for $5.4 million to participate.",53,,
264,0.97,1970.735,1976.574,"For the overtime, and to keep your promises, in terms of how they are giving the unlimited budget, or unlimited overtime budget.",53,,

282,0.97,2119.083,2136.167,"Before we go into the presentation, we could do a go around and people could give their name and their affiliation with whether they are with the Department and organization and then we can start the presentation.",56,,

327,0.97,2530.094,2561.058,"So, we are going to probably have to do a little bit of an update on that in advance of is also including some of the consent decree and that will be having those things folded into the final report, which we hope, assuming that we get our outside expert analysis, the final reports, soon.",65,,
328,0.97,2561.058,2574.271,"By the end of May 2021, we hope to have that final report with these different aspects folded into it from the interdepartmental team.",65,,
329,0.97,2574.271,2575.973,"This, I believe, may be a graph Council has already seen.",65,,
330,0.97,2575.973,2586.283,"This demonstrates the percent change from previous years, budget terribly speaking.",65,,
331,0.97,2586.283,2592.022,"You can see a huge increase in the Hst community safety investments and a decrease in the SPD budget, overall.",65,,
332,0.97,2592.022,2609.073,"This is just to give you a flavor of the net changes from 2019, as 2020 was an odd year with changes happening through.",65,,
333,0.97,2609.073,2629.727,"To give an idea for the changes that have happened between 2019 and this year's budget, I know that Hst will get a far more detailed presentation to Council with these transfers.",65,,
334,0.97,2629.727,2631.895,Just wanted to Recap them here.,65,,
335,0.97,2631.895,2654.151,We've got the transfer of the victim advocate team from SPD over to the human services division and the transfer budget and the full-time employees from the navigation team to save communities and transfer the budget for the youth for success safety contracts to save communities.,65,,
336,0.97,2654.151,2658.722,"All of those have been transferred out of the Seattle police Department, as well.",65,,
337,0.97,2658.722,2675.539,"As I indicated, for more details on how the transfers are going and what that looks like, we rely on our friends in the human services division and their presentation they will be getting this afternoon with full council weighing in on that.",65,,
338,0.97,2675.539,2676.94,"Now, I would love to turn it over to director Lombard.",65,,
339,0.97,2676.94,2692.956,"Council knows there were three primary civilian units, larger civilian units, removed from the Seattle police Department as part of the 2021 budget.",65,,
340,0.97,2692.956,2699.863,"Those were parking enforcement officers, the Non-Woodman communications center and the office of emergency management.",65,,
341,0.97,2699.863,2701.365,The Office of emergency management was functionally a Standalone unit.,65,,
342,0.97,2701.365,2708.372,Not a whole lot changed.,65,,
343,0.97,2708.372,2723.387,"The 911 communication center, as we call it now, has done a lot of work with the beginning of the year and I would love to turn it over with Chris Lombard to walk Council through how that is going.",65,,
344,0.97,2723.387,2723.854,"Thank you, Julie.",66,,
345,0.97,2723.854,2730.828,Excited to give this update on where we are.,66,,
346,0.97,2730.828,2742.84,I want to pause and see if the colleagues have questions about the first section of the presentation.,67,,
347,0.97,2742.84,2753.45,I don't see any raised hands in the participant panel.,67,,
348,0.97,2753.45,2754.318,Please speak up if I'm missing you.,67,,
349,0.97,2754.318,2764.728,"Council colleagues, I do have one question related to this civilian report and I apologize if you covered this already.",67,,
350,0.97,2764.728,2768.665,You have an estimated Timeline for this civilian report?,67,,
351,0.97,2768.665,2783.046,We hope the reports called for in the Eo will be the final report that we hope to have done by the end of May.,68,,
352,0.97,2783.046,2802.666,"You are making a distinction between a report requested by the Idt versus--are you making a distinction, I should say?",69,,
353,0.97,2802.666,2803.534,The asked for a Civilianization report.,69,,
354,0.97,2803.534,2803.867,I'm sorry.,70,,
355,0.97,2803.867,2806.47,I misunderstood the question.,70,,
356,0.97,2806.47,2819.75,I believe that director noble has a number of Provisos and slides and reports he may be seeking extensions on.,70,,
357,0.97,2819.75,2827.291,I don't know if that is one of them or not but I know there are a number of extensions for different reports and requests by Council that will be made soon.,70,,
358,0.97,2827.291,2833.463,I don't know --,70,,
359,0.97,2833.463,2834.398,We will have to follow-up separately.,71,,
360,0.97,2834.398,2834.798,Appreciate that.,71,,
361,0.97,2834.798,2834.998,Okay.,71,,
362,0.97,2834.998,2837.234,Let's move on.,71,,
363,0.97,2837.234,2837.835,"Thank you, Councilmember.",72,,
364,0.97,2837.835,2846.043,A quick update for everybody.,72,,
365,0.97,2846.043,2860.791,"We continue to work on our initial size up of the operations and the immediate needs included in this category, looking at policies and dispatch type codes and call processing protocols and what questions are being asked and why we are doing it.",72,,
366,0.97,2860.791,2875.172,"We are trying to continue to understand the picture, as it is now, so we can look to the future, or how we can modify or what we can modify . I will talk about that towards the end.",72,,
367,0.97,2875.172,2880.577,"Yesterday, we received great news and we got to a wiring number.",72,,
368,0.97,2880.577,2896.026,"That is the number given to us by the Department of justice with the FBI that allows us to dispatch for police agencies, the Seattle police Department, specifically with our own, independent or wire I number to transfer our accounting stuff.",72,,
369,0.97,2896.026,2898.662,That was a big success for us.,72,,
370,0.97,2898.662,2916.813,We are continuing to identify and hire temporary staff to help with the transition and we have an interim deputy director helping out with the strategic adviser and the last position is work to help us with strategic planning beyond the initial transfer.,72,,
371,0.97,2916.813,2921.018,We continue to work on transferring the back end office support.,72,,
372,0.97,2921.018,2937.434,"This is moving a lot of the payroll, purchasing, Finance and what not to other city departments, moving out of the police Department and trying to find new homes within the city to support the new Department with those important features.",72,,
373,0.97,2937.434,2949.613,"We've started to work with the Seattle police officers Guild--I'm sorry--with the dispatches Union, looking at the modifications that will need to be made to the current contract.",72,,
374,0.97,2949.613,2970.534,"Even though it expires at the end of this year, with the separation from police, there will be modifications that need to be had and we are Ramping up negotiations to look at language out of sequence to help facilitate that relationship with Dispatchers.",72,,
375,0.97,2970.534,2988.919,"Upcoming items we are working on, we continue analyzing the staffing and budget needs to continue the successful transition to an independent organization and continuing that work with the Seattle police, as far as pulling the strings apart between the two departments on the Finance and the budget.",72,,
376,0.97,2988.919,3020.884,"As Julie mentioned, we are working on the city spent with a quick size of to see what other cities around the nation are doing, in regards to alternatives to policing and trying to gather up best practices around the country, as far as how others have already gone before us in finding different ways to meet citizen needs that don't necessarily involve the response of a police officer.",72,,
377,0.97,3020.884,3032.396,"And, to still meet citizen's needs with good sessions in good feedback on alternatives, or what is available out there to kind of build the roadblocks to see what might work here in Seattle.",72,,
378,0.97,3032.396,3046.343,"The last item that we have is that last week, of course, the Mayor's office submitted legislation to Council on the parking enforcement transfer legislation.",72,,
379,0.97,3046.343,3047.31,"So, waiting to see Council's action on that.",72,,
380,0.97,3047.31,3048.445,That's all I have for the update for right now.,72,,
381,0.97,3048.445,3051.648,Thank you so much.,73,,
382,0.97,3051.648,3061.858,"I want to say that I appreciate you coming on, interim director, Lombard, to do this really important work.",73,,
383,0.97,3061.858,3103.8,"As it relates specifically to the participation of the community safety, the communications center in the what works city Sprint, what is the vision that you have and the executive has for the role that your Department will have in the development and potential of the implementation of the alternative to police dispatch?",73,,
384,0.97,3103.8,3112.209,"At this point, Councilmember, we are trying to work on our Size-Up so we aren't reinventing the wheel.",74,,
385,0.97,3112.209,3119.683,We are trying to do a Size-Up with best practices.,74,,
386,0.97,3119.683,3126.289,"Looking at the key cities of Portland, Oregon, Eugene, Oregon and Denver, Colorado.",74,,
387,0.97,3126.289,3130.56,Those were three that came to mind with different response units and different types of networks that they have available.,74,,
388,0.97,3130.56,3143.306,"We are trying to find out what works for them, the pros and's and if they had to do it over, what they would do differently, trying to get budgeting numbers to see success rates.",74,,
389,0.97,3143.306,3154.317,"At this point, what is out there and what people are doing and how successful how it is right now to help us put together that plan.",74,,
390,0.97,3154.317,3157.22,Thank you.,75,,
391,0.97,3157.22,3177.073,"The slide says that it is the securing of the or I number, and did you secure it?",75,,
392,0.97,3177.073,3183.38,Just yesterday we put the slides together and we found out yesterday afternoon.,76,,
393,0.97,3183.38,3184.181,That is an update from the slide.,76,,
394,0.97,3184.181,3184.614,Congratulations.,77,,
395,0.97,3184.614,3190.086,Fantastic news.,77,,
396,0.97,3190.086,3196.459,Any other questions from Council members here?,77,,
397,0.97,3196.459,3210.507,"For some reason, sometimes, I have the raise the hand feature and sometimes I don't . I apologize.",78,,
398,0.97,3210.507,3211.341,It's hard to see the shared screen.,78,,
399,0.97,3211.341,3242.806,"I don't have a question but I just want to encourage some sort of more inclusive language, as we are talking about these efforts . again, this comes from my perspective of being somebody who came up through the immigrant rights movement and is part of the refugee community in our city.",78,,
400,0.97,3242.806,3247.844,"I would like to discourage the use of the terminology, citizen, as we are talking about who we are delivering services to.",78,,
401,0.97,3247.844,3267.13,"It is not just about people born in this country, but about everybody who resides, lives and works in the city of Seattle.",78,,
402,0.97,3267.13,3297.327,"I realize director Lombard tended to use language that would exclude segments of our population but I think it's really important for us to make sure we are using the most inclusive terms and the city Council, a few years ago, did revise our ordinances to strike the word citizens from many of our laws and replace those words with resident, to be more reflective of the realities of our population here in the city.",78,,
403,0.97,3297.327,3298.361,Sure.,79,,
404,0.97,3298.361,3298.595,Thanks.,79,,
405,0.97,3298.595,3299.329,A good reminder.,80,,
406,0.97,3299.329,3299.629,Thank you.,80,,
407,0.97,3299.629,3328.291,"One other point I would love to flag and Dr. Lumberg, you and I had discussed this . for the community safety and communications center, I'm so excited that health one has expanded to a second unit, very recently.",80,,
408,0.97,3328.291,3360.724,"It has been flagged, for me, by members of the public and as well, the Seattle fire Department and some of my colleagues on the Council, that there is more work to be done as it relates to dispatching mental health and behavioral health calls to health one and health two.",80,,
409,0.97,3360.724,3389.986,"I just want to say, affirmatively, for the public record, that are really hopeful that we can find ways to expedite that work . I know that the number of mental health calls, behavioral health calls, that 911 takes far exceeds even the additional capacity of health one and health two and will exceed the capacity of health three when the other expansion occurs in August.",80,,
410,0.97,3389.986,3410.073,"I think we need to begin to have a conversation about which calls to divert from 911 with the understanding that we can't, at this stage, divert them all.",80,,
411,0.97,3410.073,3410.407,Thank you.,81,,
412,0.97,3410.407,3414.811,Thank you so much.,82,,
413,0.97,3414.811,3419.249,Councilmember Lewis?,83,,
414,0.97,3419.249,3420.917,"Thank you, Madam chair.",84,,
415,0.97,3420.917,3440.37,"Just jumping into Riff a little bit off your last comment, I want to ask, as we look into the new response systems, one of the things in my personal research and talking to Stakeholders and other places like Eugene and Denver is the back end resource.",84,,
416,0.97,3440.37,3452.182,"It's not so much the on the ground Responder that we dispatch for the mental health call, for the Intravenous drug use in the doorway that has a different Responder suited to that public health.",84,,
417,0.97,3452.182,3465.295,Is having sufficient places where that person can then be diverted to meet the underlying need.,84,,
418,0.97,3465.295,3472.769,A lot of the systems are integrated into some kind of clinic like the Star program in Denver is integrated into a sort of version of the downtown emergency service Ceter that they have.,84,,
419,0.97,3472.769,3478.374,"Of course, integrated into the White bird clinic.",84,,
420,0.97,3478.374,3492.388,"As we look into this, are we identifying what the back end resource would be, required to make the first response effective?",84,,
421,0.97,3492.388,3502.265,"Because, I think we spend a lot of time talking about these different responses and how the teams are made up and what the background and training will be and the approach to engaging with folks.",84,,
422,0.97,3502.265,3516.246,"I feel like we also need to be really intensely looking at our provider capacity, the institutions we currently have to support those folks and how those response services will be integrated into a system like that.",84,,
423,0.97,3516.246,3533.029,We have that as part of the bigger conversation because we focus on the vehicle and the team that shows up and less on how we will build the capacity for those other systems.,84,,
424,0.97,3533.029,3536.199,"Frankly, I think it's our biggest efficiency.",84,,
425,0.97,3536.199,3539.602,"We notice that, Councilmember, early in the Sprint and with conversations with Seattle fire.",85,,
426,0.97,3539.602,3554.55,"We reached out to the hospital system, as well and brought on representatives from the Swedish network and from Harborview as the local trauma center with access to some psychological help.",85,,
427,0.97,3554.55,3562.425,We actually notice that and brought on some of those entities to the Sprint.,85,,
428,0.97,3562.425,3562.692,Great.,86,,
429,0.97,3562.692,3569.365,I look forward to the report back on that.,86,,
430,0.97,3569.365,3569.666,Thank you.,86,,
431,0.97,3569.666,3578.341,"Councilmember, we've gotten a really warm reception from some of our health care partners, public health care partners, and wanting to collaborate with solutions and we are pretty excited about that.",87,,
432,0.97,3578.341,3585.815,All right.,88,,
433,0.97,3585.815,3586.849,Anything else?,88,,
434,0.97,3586.849,3588.918,Let's move on.,89,,
435,0.97,3588.918,3589.218,Thank you.,89,,
436,0.97,3589.218,3589.819,I will kick it over to Dr.,90,,
437,0.97,3589.819,3601.698,Fischer with a quick overview of the SPD public safety obligations and to introduce Dr. Helfgot.,90,,
438,0.97,3601.698,3604.534,"Thanks, Julie and Madam chair.",91,,
439,0.97,3604.534,3616.212,"As Julie said, I won't go through this slide, but putting it out there as a reminder of the overall Charter obligation to provide adequate police services in every District of the city.",91,,
440,0.97,3616.212,3664.661,"I don't think anyone needs a reminder, including with recent media coverage that we continue to be working through how we manage against increasing numbers of folks leaving the Department and how we continue to provide all of the services people expect from us while we do this work and thinking through what other resources could handle with some of those asks from the community and Úalso, trying to make sure, as we continue in these budget discussions, that we are keeping our spending in line and making sure we are able to support activities, especially as the city reopens with great news from the CDC.",91,,
441,0.97,3671.3,3681.577,"To continue to speed up, I do think that Dr. Helfgot is on and she is the next slide.",91,,
442,0.97,3681.577,3687.083,Thank you Dr. Fischer.,92,,
443,0.97,3687.083,3692.889,Do you want me to get started?,93,,
444,0.97,3692.889,3696.359,Sounds great and we appreciate you being here with us.,94,,
445,0.97,3696.359,3699.429,Thanks for having me.,95,,
446,0.97,3699.429,3706.302,"As you know, we've been doing the Seattle public safety survey every year since 2015.",95,,
447,0.97,3706.302,3707.87,"Julie, are you going to do the slides for me?",95,,
448,0.97,3707.87,3716.079,You can go to the next slide.,95,,
449,0.97,3716.079,3724.921,"Most people know about this survey, part of the Mic Rowe community in policing initiative and we've done it since 2015.",95,,
450,0.97,3724.921,3729.759,"In between the surveys, we've been doing focus groups and we do community police dialogues from May through August.",95,,
451,0.97,3729.759,3751.748,Spd has been improving the public facing Website ever since 2015 and the Data-Driven unit now has the interactive public facing Website to compare the survey findings from year to year.,95,,
452,0.97,3751.748,3760.156,I should mention that the survey is focused on the geographical neighborhoods.,95,,
453,0.97,3760.156,3779.775,"I don't know any other survey that collects data at the Micro community level within all 55 Seattle neighborhoods based on the idea that every neighborhood is unique, in terms of concerns about public safety.",95,,
454,0.97,3779.775,3788.084,We've been administering this survey and 11 languages every year and you can see the responses we've had every year.,95,,
455,0.97,3788.084,3796.292,"This year, we had the highest number of responses with over 14,000 responses this year.",95,,
456,0.97,3796.292,3824.72,"It is focused on neighborhoods in this Yea, there are about 3000 that we did not use because they did not identify their neighborhoods but we had 1,141,010 this year and every year, about 50% offer narrative comments on open-ended questions we have at the end of the survey and over 60% provided the narrative comments.",95,,
457,0.97,3824.72,3831.127,You probably can't see this slide.,95,,
458,0.97,3831.127,3838.1,The survey is a Nonprobability survey.,95,,
459,0.97,3838.1,3847.109,"We wait for responses and every year we have more white women in a certain mid-range, middle age range.",95,,
460,0.97,3847.109,3861.624,"If someone who is in their 20s, maybe a black male, participating in the survey, it will be statistically graphic for the city.",95,,
461,0.97,3861.624,3873.336,A 20-year-old black male will have his response he waited with three times or four times for the people who have way too many of.,95,,
462,0.97,3873.336,3881.577,We have all the different demographic variables.,95,,
463,0.97,3881.577,3896.392,"We feel confident about the result of the survey for being representative of the city, given the large numbers of people that respond, in comparison to probability studies done in Seattle that usually have 600 to 900 people or so participating.",95,,
464,0.97,3896.392,3901.697,These are the top concerns.,96,,
465,0.97,3901.697,3914.51,We have questions in the survey that have identified the top concerns.,96,,
466,0.97,3914.51,3923.92,"These are the top safety concerns divided into the nine indices, based on those concerns.",96,,
467,0.97,3923.92,3930.259,We have top concerns with the data being quantitative to check the top concerns and then we have the top themes on the next slide.,96,,
468,0.97,3930.259,3938.234,These are the top themes and these are based on the narrative comments.,96,,
469,0.97,3938.234,3952.782,"In some cases, we have very long narrative comments and the research analysts, the Seattle university students, plow through all of the qualitative comments and identify themes.",96,,
470,0.97,3952.782,3971.834,"This year, we had 45 themes grouped into 15 theme indices and every year we look to the comments and some years there might be new themes and last year, there were 42 and this year, 45 themes.",96,,
471,0.97,3971.834,3972.635,We will go to the next slide.,96,,
472,0.97,3972.635,3980.876,These are the top concerns and top themes this year.,96,,
473,0.97,3980.876,3987.083,"Top five public safety concerns this year were police capacity, property crime, homelessness, drugs and alcohol and community and public safety capacity.",96,,
474,0.97,3987.083,4014.577,"We shortened the last few years and this year, it's police capacity and the community of public safety had to do with people saying--identifying more social services needed or more mental health services beyond law enforcement.",96,,
475,0.97,4014.577,4020.916,"The top most prominent themes in the narrative comments were city politics, public order, crime, police capacity and homelessness.",96,,
476,0.97,4020.916,4045.708,"Police capacity has been consistent over the last five years, has been in the top two public safety concerns pit homelessness has been rising year to year and drugs and alcohol, I believe, was in the top concerns in the past five years.",96,,
477,0.97,4045.708,4051.647,We've never had city politics in the top five narrative themes and this year it rose to the top.,96,,
478,0.97,4051.647,4082.812,"If you look at the scale responses, the unique thing about the survey is that we have these scales in the survey that measure aspects of quality and life and neighborhoods and we ask people to rate on the scale on their sets of questions that are measuring these concepts of police legitimacy, social cohesion, informal social control, social disorganization and fear of crime.",96,,
479,0.97,4082.812,4095.591,"This shows the police legitimacy rating was 58.4 and this year, very, very slightly down from last year.",96,,
480,0.97,4095.591,4098.594,Informal social control was down from last year and social disorganization was up from last year.,96,,
481,0.97,4098.594,4104.867,"Otherwise, they are relatively stable from last year.",96,,
482,0.97,4104.867,4113.576,"You can see the mean scale responses, over time, on the graph to the right.",96,,
483,0.97,4113.576,4135.431,"We also asked about people's views of policing . The Seattle police, the police in the United States, generally and every year, for police and the United States, you can see the rating.",96,,
484,0.97,4135.431,4148.911,"53 in Seattle versus 50 on the 100-Point scale on the United States, generally . I can go to the next slide and if you have questions as I go, feel free to ask.",96,,
485,0.97,4148.911,4180.976,"City wide, and comparison to different precincts, every year, different precincts have had slightly different concerns . If you look at the East precinct police legitimacy, it was the top theme in the East Precinct, different than the Seattle citywide and if you look at the North Precinct, homelessness was at the top for the public safety concerns.",96,,
486,0.97,4180.976,4184.98,"Homelessness was also one of the themes, as was city politics.",96,,
487,0.97,4184.98,4193.589,"If you look at the South Precinct, city politics was at the top and violent crime was one of the themes that we DDn't see in the top five.",96,,
488,0.97,4193.589,4194.857,"And, some of the other precincts.",96,,
489,0.97,4194.857,4206.502,Safety is in the top five in the Southwest and continues to be in the top five this year.,96,,
490,0.97,4206.502,4211.307,"You can see in the West Precinct, homelessness was at the top.",96,,
491,0.97,4211.307,4214.376,It shows some of the differences in the different precincts.,96,,
492,0.97,4214.376,4222.418,"Can you remind me, what is the difference between police capacity and community and public safety capacity?",97,,
493,0.97,4222.418,4240.936,"Police capacity has to do with a number of drop downs that people can select, like I want more police in the neighborhood.",98,,
494,0.97,4242.204,4254.984,"For the police capacity ones, the public safety capacity has to do with needing more social services in the neighborhoods and more mental health services in the neighborhoods, not police, other social services in the city.",98,,
495,0.97,4254.984,4255.351,Thank you.,99,,
496,0.97,4255.351,4259.121,Can you go to the next slide?,100,,
497,0.97,4259.121,4260.356,I have 10 minutes and I'm going fast.,100,,
498,0.97,4260.356,4266.228,"This shows the different scale responses, citywide.",100,,
499,0.97,4266.228,4281.01,"What is the most notable to mention, one of the most notable things to mention, is the difference in the police legitimacy rating.",100,,
500,0.97,4281.01,4294.123,"If you look at the East precinct police legitimacy ratings, it was 50.4 on a 100- point scale and if you look at the West Precinct, it's 64.7.",100,,
501,0.97,4294.123,4307.803,"There is a pretty big span, in terms of police legitimacy ratings with the lowest being East and the highest being West and also, Southwest.",100,,
502,0.97,4307.803,4326.789,"The other thing you might look at is the social disorganization ratings, which range from the low of 36 in the Southwest to the high of 51 in the West.",100,,
503,0.97,4326.789,4335.831,It gives you a way of looking at these different scales with respect to the different aspects of public safety across the city.,100,,
504,0.97,4335.831,4343.138,It looks like Councilmember Lewis has a question?,101,,
505,0.97,4343.138,4345.407,Let's wait until we finish a section and then we can go to the appropriate slides.,102,,
506,0.97,4345.407,4355.184,I put this slide in to show the interesting things.,103,,
507,0.97,4355.184,4363.425,"We didn't have this in the actual public facing report, but there is interesting things we saw based on demographics.",103,,
508,0.97,4363.425,4370.666,We are planning to do an academic article with a more deeper dive of these findings.,103,,
509,0.97,4370.666,4374.303,We did find a linear relationship between age and ratings of police legitimacy.,103,,
510,0.97,4374.303,4392.588,"If you take out 90 plus, we only had nine people in the 90 plus group but if you look between 20 through 89, as a person gets older, the higher ratings of police legitimacy.",103,,
511,0.97,4392.588,4397.86,"The lowest rating of police legitimacy, we have the weighted and the Unweighted.",103,,
512,0.97,4397.86,4409.204,"If you use the Tran30 Favre, it is 23 on the scale for people under 20 as compared to the group was 78.5, quite a big span of legitimacy.",103,,
513,0.97,4409.204,4433.929,"The other interesting finding is the Bipap groups for the respondents in the survey rated police legitimacy higher than the White respondents in the range is 57.5 with the White respondents and black respondents, African-American black was 61.3 and similar to the other Bipoc groups.",103,,
514,0.97,4433.929,4450.913,"If you look at gender, the males rated police legitimacy higher, 63.2, as compared to females, 57.2.",103,,
515,0.97,4450.913,4457.352,"The lowest was Transgender and people who didn't identify a gender, which was 36.2.",103,,
516,0.97,4457.352,4485.781,This shows the different scale ratings with a different way of looking at them by precinct . I don't need to go into this but this gives an example of how the survey findings can be used.,103,,
517,0.97,4485.781,4498.293,"To look at the survey with the difference between the different neighborhoods in a Precinct, in terms of their perceptions of quality of life and of talking concerns.",103,,
518,0.97,4498.293,4512.14,"This shows two neighborhoods in the South Precinct, Hillman city and Sodo that had the lowest and the highest police legitimacy rating, citywide in one precinct.",103,,
519,0.97,4512.14,4521.516,"Hillman city had the lowest rate, 36.2 and Sodo had the highest, 77 .8.",103,,
520,0.97,4521.516,4525.52,It's interesting to see the different legitimacy's.,103,,
521,0.97,4525.52,4535.13,"Similarly, there are differences with the top concerns and the prominent themes.",103,,
522,0.97,4535.13,4539.801,You can go to the next one.,103,,
523,0.97,4539.801,4547.175,I don't know if you want to me to go into the differences.,103,,
524,0.97,4547.175,4548.911,We can stop here.,103,,
525,0.97,4548.911,4550.846,You want me to keep going?,103,,
526,0.97,4550.846,4552.514,If you've got another slide.,104,,
527,0.97,4552.514,4570.432,I have a few more slides and these are just examples of social disorganization ratings with a good idea about how people feel about their surroundings with graffiti and open-air activity and littering and things like that.,105,,
528,0.97,4570.432,4578.774,The lowest rating in the city was sand point and the highest social disorganization in the city was Pioneer square.,105,,
529,0.97,4578.774,4585.48,You can look at that in relation to the top concerns and themes.,105,,
530,0.97,4585.48,4593.055,Property crime in Pioneer square and homelessness and public order crime.,105,,
531,0.97,4593.055,4593.689,You can go to the next slide.,105,,
532,0.97,4593.689,4615.477,"This is the informal social control, the degree to which people are willing to call the police or joined the block watch to take responsibility for what is going on in their neighborhoods.",105,,
533,0.97,4615.477,4621.116,These are the lowest and highest ratings of informal social control.,105,,
534,0.97,4621.116,4624.82,"Pioneer square, 27.6 as compared to magnolia, 57.3.",105,,
535,0.97,4624.82,4652.247,"You can look at that in relation to the top concerns in the top themes were homelessness, public order and crime are associated with the unwillingness or the feeling of helplessness to not take ownership to do anything about it, as compared to in a community like magnolia, where the top concerns are kept police capacity and city politics.",105,,
536,0.97,4652.247,4654.95,We can go to the next one.,105,,
537,0.97,4654.95,4663.658,Social cohesion has to do with the degree to which people feel they know their neighbors and have a tight community.,105,,
538,0.97,4663.658,4667.396,"The lowest ratings of social cohesion were in Sodo, 39 and the highest was in sand point.",105,,
539,0.97,4667.396,4682.277,"Again, looking with the top themes, in Sodo, it was homelessness in city politics and sand point was police capacity and property crime.",105,,
540,0.97,4682.277,4688.85,"I did want to highlight that this year, we are doing something different than we've done before.",105,,
541,0.97,4688.85,4693.121,We've done focus groups every year in between the administration of the survey.,105,,
542,0.97,4693.121,4699.761,We've done the focus groups to have a more Realtime way of collecting information about people's concerns.,105,,
543,0.97,4699.761,4711.807,"This year, we wanted to do Dialogues and we've had these meetings to talk about the survey results and to talk about our concerns.",105,,
544,0.97,4711.807,4724.219,"This year, we are reaching out to the community and we are doing a reach out, internally, to SPD, for volunteers to participate in these community and police dialogues.",105,,
545,0.97,4724.219,4745.407,"The ideas to do it with a restorative framework, where there can be dialogue regarding the findings in the surveys, specifically and of people have Realtime issues that they want to discuss with the police . I wanted to do a shout out to the research assistants.",105,,
546,0.97,4745.407,4763.725,"Every year, we have five or six graduate and undergraduate research analysts that work on this project and we had 29 research analysts, to date, who have participated during the research on this project.",105,,
547,0.97,4763.725,4769.064,"Most of them, when they graduate, they have gone into law enforcement with SPD, FBI and other local agencies.",105,,
548,0.97,4769.064,4772.0,I thank them for their work.,105,,
549,0.97,4772.0,4785.08,"This year, we had these volunteers.",105,,
550,0.97,4785.08,4797.359,The next slide is my contact information and my colleague and I do the survey to gather every year with the research analysts.,105,,
551,0.97,4797.359,4798.86,I'm happy to answer questions.,105,,
552,0.97,4798.86,4806.768,Thank you so much for this overview and I really appreciate you condensing the presentation.,106,,
553,0.97,4806.768,4807.235,Councilmember Lewis?,106,,
554,0.97,4807.235,4807.802,"Thank you, Madam chair.",107,,
555,0.97,4807.802,4808.336,I have a clarification.,107,,
556,0.97,4808.336,4826.555,"If we look at the themes, like the themes people were responding to, if you can go back in the slide deck, I guess--the city politics theme, what is that, exactly?",107,,
557,0.97,4826.555,4835.697,Is that sort of a narrative that we can't get along with the Council and the Mayor?,107,,
558,0.97,4835.697,4842.137,What does that mean when people are saying that?,107,,
559,0.97,4842.137,4843.238,Is it like the internal perception of Dysfunction?,107,,
560,0.97,4843.238,4860.021,We did the ratings and we had Subcodes where people called out the city Council and the Callout people by name.,108,,
561,0.97,4860.021,4863.992,"We don't have that deep dive, but we actually have the city council positive and city council negative.",108,,
562,0.97,4863.992,4871.433,It was overwhelmingly negative.,108,,
563,0.97,4871.433,4880.475,"If anybody said anything about city politics, that they were obstructing public safety, we have gotten that every year.",108,,
564,0.97,4880.475,4891.486,It was more than we had seen before.,108,,
565,0.97,4891.486,4898.927,"For the other city politicians, that they generally said politics were getting in the way of public safety?",108,,
566,0.97,4898.927,4900.895,Thanks for clarifying that.,109,,
567,0.97,4900.895,4921.383,"On that note, I remember that there was a mention--and I might be wrong--that you some more evidence of this survey being shared on social media this year than in past years.",110,,
568,0.97,4921.383,4922.317,Is that true?,110,,
569,0.97,4922.317,4931.359,Are there any outcomes that you speculate might have resulted from that?,110,,
570,0.97,4931.359,4931.593,No.,111,,
571,0.97,4931.593,4946.474,"I don't think those anymore . I don't know--we've done the same outreach every year, the survey administration, through the precincts including social media and Facebook.",111,,
572,0.97,4946.474,4975.937,"The one thing different this year, and I'm not good at Twitter--I have Twitter and I was tagged and contacted directly, actually called and tagged and contacted directly by some people involved in the protest, Pro-D funding and were spreading the survey around on social media.",111,,
573,0.97,4975.937,4988.984,"There is nothing different on our end, but to try to improve our outreach through different social media.",111,,
574,0.97,4988.984,4990.118,People were actively talking about it in social media.,111,,
575,0.97,4990.118,4993.955,That is helpful to understand.,112,,
576,0.97,4993.955,4994.622,I would send both sides.,113,,
577,0.97,4994.622,4995.357,It was on both sides.,113,,
578,0.97,4995.357,5022.984,"My question is whether or not the distribution of the survey not by yourselves, but by other actors, whether there was an attempt to evaluate the impact of that on the outcomes of the survey?",114,,
579,0.97,5022.984,5039.601,We did--we were concerned that somebody would tried to Bot the survey and have a whole bunch of people take it.,115,,
580,0.97,5039.601,5048.543,We are able to go in and we can see if the same person--we did a lot of Cross-Checking on that.,115,,
581,0.97,5048.543,5058.486,"Because of the number and nature of the narrative comments, we can have a high degree of confidence in the people that we kept in the responses that were kept in and those kicked out.",115,,
582,0.97,5058.486,5075.637,"If the same person with the same number responded with no comments, we can see when someone tries to take it over and over again, is what I'm saying.",115,,
583,0.97,5075.637,5075.904,"So, yes.",115,,
584,0.97,5075.904,5084.112,"The answer was, yes, we are able to see that.",116,,
585,0.97,5084.112,5085.146,Councilmember Morales?,117,,
586,0.97,5085.146,5086.714,I'm interested in learning more about your engagement process.,118,,
587,0.97,5086.714,5093.988,You mentioned a couple of times that you consistently have more white women taking the survey.,118,,
588,0.97,5093.988,5113.675,It seems to me a reason to change up the way you do outreach if you are not getting a more representative or more diverse response.,118,,
589,0.97,5113.675,5121.382,You mentioned social media but are there other ways in which you are trying to get folks to engage with this survey?,118,,
590,0.97,5121.382,5122.917,Sure.,119,,
591,0.97,5122.917,5126.421,We do change every year and try to improve every year.,119,,
592,0.97,5126.421,5145.473,We've done everything from reaching out--this year we did that a little bit differently and we've even done paper flyers to the Seattle public schools that go out to the parents.,119,,
593,0.97,5145.473,5162.724,"We do the survey administration and we couldn't this year, because of Covid but Recontacted the emergency services center and asked them to get the word out with Unhoused persons and we've administered this in the Southwest precinct and downtown.",119,,
594,0.97,5162.724,5171.699,We plastered the flyers citywide with business cards and flyers and we are at the parks and Starbucks and the Seattle public library.,119,,
595,0.97,5171.699,5184.279,"Given with Covid this year, we plastered the flyers, but we had a more elaborate reach out plan on the Email list.",119,,
596,0.97,5184.279,5185.113,"Nursing homes, the Chargois homes.",119,,
597,0.97,5185.113,5191.085,The different community organizations.,119,,
598,0.97,5191.085,5199.427,It's a very elaborate reach out Email list in social media list for each precinct.,119,,
599,0.97,5199.427,5214.609,"One of the issues with more white women--more white women complete complete--the middle aged range, complete surveys, and in general.",119,,
600,0.97,5214.609,5223.751,"It's not just our survey and we've done everything we possibly can to do that outreach, including languages.",119,,
601,0.97,5223.751,5226.487,I agree that we would love to continue to improve on the outreach.,119,,
602,0.97,5226.487,5235.897,"We also have, of course, the different African-American advisory councils and the different community Council meetings.",119,,
603,0.97,5235.897,5246.841,We've gone two groups and to reach out.,119,,
604,0.97,5246.841,5249.143,The responsibility of the I.R.A.,119,,
605,0.97,5249.143,5257.118,In each precinct is to identify community groups from all different communities within each community to try to get the word out on the survey.,119,,
606,0.97,5257.118,5263.858,"Many times, I've gone to speak in groups and we try to get the word out through the media, different media outlets.",119,,
607,0.97,5263.858,5271.232,You mentioned that you will be doing a paper.,120,,
608,0.97,5271.232,5276.938,One of my questions was on how desegregated by race and age these results are?,120,,
609,0.97,5276.938,5281.876,"So, can you talk about when you will be making that available?",120,,
610,0.97,5281.876,5291.052,"You know, it takes quite a while to get from start to finish, to get the article published.",121,,
611,0.97,5291.052,5305.333,We are working right now and we have several articles that get to a deeper dive on the findings that we were thinking of doing with the article on the responses on the protest versus the Defunding issue.,121,,
612,0.97,5305.333,5314.108,That rose to the top this year with all of the comments.,121,,
613,0.97,5314.108,5322.317,We are working on it now and should have the actual article done over the next few months.,121,,
614,0.97,5322.317,5323.451,The implementation progress will be after a few months.,121,,
615,0.97,5323.451,5328.122,Thank you.,122,,
616,0.97,5328.122,5331.192,This is an annual survey.,122,,
617,0.97,5331.192,5337.732,We appreciate the work that goes into this every year.,122,,
618,0.97,5337.732,5346.507,"In past years, and I likely will do so this year, I promote the outcomes.",122,,
619,0.97,5346.507,5355.516,"I also let readers of my newsletter no about the survey tool, as you are doing the work out in the field.",122,,
620,0.97,5355.516,5390.251,"I'm interested to understand--given that this is an annual survey--and, that this is been identified for us, today, as an input to the city's work around identifying functions for Nonuniformed policing, as part of the broader, reducing the Footprint of the police Department.",122,,
621,0.97,5390.251,5400.027,"And, the other tasks in the interdepartmental team, executive order.",122,,
622,0.97,5400.027,5403.865,How does this information fit into that?,122,,
623,0.97,5403.865,5410.071,That may be a question for Julie?,123,,
624,0.97,5410.071,5411.172,"That's a question for myself, or potentially, Dr.",124,,
625,0.97,5411.172,5412.206,Fisher.,124,,
626,0.97,5412.206,5422.75,I think it all feeds into our basic understanding that public opinion is not a monolith.,124,,
627,0.97,5422.75,5424.085,It does vary by neighborhood and within neighborhoods.,124,,
628,0.97,5424.085,5438.332,"I think we probably are our--well, obviously, this survey has significant failure.",124,,
629,0.97,5438.332,5444.138,"But, it's only one piece of the community engagement we are doing.",124,,
630,0.97,5444.138,5446.641,"Next, we will have Sonny Nguyen walking us through other aspects of community engagement surrounding this work.",124,,
631,0.97,5446.641,5470.731,"I think the longevity of this survey and the number of years they been doing it and how it reached, is super helpful for us to understand the different aspects of the neighborhood perceived as primary issues.",124,,
632,0.97,5472.4,5477.171,"And, where they should be placed or concentrated.",124,,
633,0.97,5477.171,5477.972,Thank you.,125,,
634,0.97,5477.972,5485.146,I'm not seeing any further questions from Council members.,125,,
635,0.97,5485.146,5489.75,Let's move on to Sonny.,125,,
636,0.97,5489.75,5490.051,Awesome.,126,,
637,0.97,5490.051,5490.351,All right.,126,,
638,0.97,5490.351,5494.422,I will start by echoing what Julie just said.,126,,
639,0.97,5494.422,5508.769,We have all of this great data coming in from some of the neighborhood public safety surveys with the annual surveys that are considered in this work.,126,,
640,0.97,5508.769,5519.814,The main goals of our engagement for this specific Idt process was to Demystify the SPD budget.,126,,
641,0.97,5519.814,5525.82,You have this information on the slides.,126,,
642,0.97,5525.82,5536.497,"To talk specifically about SPD, there is already a lot of great work about standing up SPD to expand the community safety network.",126,,
643,0.97,5536.497,5543.237,"We wanted to make sure we weren't undermining that research and that work and focusing on the Department, it SELLS.",126,,
644,0.97,5543.237,5544.872,We can move to the next slide.,126,,
645,0.97,5544.872,5561.822,We do that in a few different ways in the first thing is to reach out to the city boards and commissions with folks that Council and the executive have worked to put into our city system to give this exact kind of feedback.,126,,
646,0.97,5561.822,5615.042,"We met with 10 boards of commissions and the major things we got our that as we move things out of SPD, we need to make sure they are set up for success and we are not just doing budget magic and not just taking the dollars from SPD to put somewhere else, but Reimagining them to make sure that we are creating deep change and that several commissions mentioned they want officers trained further in cultural competency and tactics of De- escalation elation and to see the types of Trainings shifting and they want to see the community led training, as well as professional training that SPD already receives and finally, remove the SPD presence in the navigation team, which they do already.",126,,
647,0.97,5615.042,5619.413,Next slide.,126,,
648,0.97,5619.413,5628.089,We've also been conducting a lot of listening sessions and focus groups with some of these listed on the left.,126,,
649,0.97,5628.089,5636.631,This work is not done and there is no point where we could say we've done enough outreach on the conversation like this.,126,,
650,0.97,5636.631,5646.907,"We will do these listening sessions and focus groups until we submit the final report and even after that, we need to keep those conversations moving, of course.",126,,
651,0.97,5646.907,5663.758,The major themes from the listening sessions is that folks are concerned about the transfer of civilian units to make sure we aren't building additional bureaucracy that damages efficacy and we are setting them up for success.,126,,
652,0.97,5663.758,5679.173,They want to see opportunities for the new entries into the community system to collaborate with the SPD current system so that we are building integrative community safety networks and not distinctly parallel SPD tracks.,126,,
653,0.97,5679.173,5685.846,This is the social work track and these systems are working together to build up a true community safety system.,126,,
654,0.97,5685.846,5701.262,"To finish off, we have to continue this work beyond the final report, of course and we will do more listening sessions, particularly with labor partners.",126,,
655,0.97,5701.262,5712.239,We are waiting on expert reports to come through.,126,,
656,0.97,5719.78,5725.619,That is a quick down and dirty on the community engagement we've been doing so far.,126,,
657,0.97,5725.619,5734.729,Let's see whether or not I have any other hands raised here.,127,,
658,0.97,5734.729,5740.534,Not seeing any.,127,,
659,0.97,5740.534,5750.244,"Again, this is really helpful.",127,,
660,0.97,5750.244,5758.752,"Council has seen this, as well.",128,,
661,0.97,5758.752,5762.656,"These are some of the National partners we are working with, with functional analysis and new models of community safety.",128,,
662,0.97,5762.656,5793.354,"We included slides for awareness and Council is well aware, as for the city Sprint we are participating in, an eight week program where it walks us through and helps us to facilitate the city and explore alternate emergency response models and what might work for Seattle with lessons learned and information from other cities.",128,,
663,0.97,5793.354,5802.997,We have a very broad Cohort in the city of Seattle with a lot of people interested in being involved in this conversation.,128,,
664,0.97,5802.997,5810.871,"It's a Nonexhaustive list and we've added additional Seattle members to the Cohort, calling in for each of these sessions.",128,,
665,0.97,5810.871,5814.375,I have a general overview of what the different sessions are.,128,,
666,0.97,5814.375,5816.31,That is the wrap up.,128,,
667,0.97,5816.31,5826.287,I will stop there and we are available to answer any questions pertaining to anything.,128,,
668,0.97,5826.287,5827.688,Great.,129,,
669,0.97,5827.688,5827.988,Thank you.,129,,
670,0.97,5827.988,5845.372,"I want to thank you, Julie, for making it possible for so many of the internal Stakeholders to participate in what works city Sprint but the external partners.",129,,
671,0.97,5845.372,5861.255,"As a participant, I'm finding that there are a lot of--for other cities--a lot of voices, external to government, that are participating and it's really important that we hear their perspectives in other cities and in our own, as well.",129,,
672,0.97,5861.255,5872.333,Going broad is super useful to our end product.,129,,
673,0.97,5872.333,5882.743,Looking to see whether or not there are any other questions.,129,,
674,0.97,5882.743,5884.144,I see none.,129,,
675,0.97,5884.144,5885.079,Thank you so much.,129,,
676,0.97,5885.079,5888.048,"Thank you thank you for having us, Councilmember Herbold.",130,,
677,0.97,5888.048,5893.187,"Once our Idt report is finalized, we will be happy to come back and walk through that with you.",130,,
678,0.97,5893.187,5895.689,Look forward to it.,131,,
679,0.97,5895.689,5896.156,Thank you.,131,,
680,0.97,5896.156,5899.159,Will the clerk read agenda item 2 into the record?,132,,
681,0.97,5899.159,5903.097,Seattle police Department quarterly Finance and staffing reports.,133,,
682,0.97,5903.097,5903.964,Thank you very much.,134,,
683,0.97,5903.964,5915.776,"We have with us, Greg Doss and Aly Pennucci from sound soul Council central staff.",134,,
684,0.97,5915.776,5923.284,The quarterly reports seem like the most productive approach for updating Council members.,134,,
685,0.97,5923.284,5949.576,"Many of these reports reports we receive monthly and we appreciate the work of Greg Doss and Aly Pennucci to find a way to transmit that information to us in a way that is efficient and, hopefully, will be effective to our efforts to scrutinize the Seattle police Department budget.",134,,
686,0.97,5949.576,5965.96,"Before I turn it over, the opening remarks, that the 2021 Seattle police Department hiring plan is fully funded in the budget that is adopted by the Council in November.",134,,
687,0.97,5965.96,5985.012,"Again, as this discussion is intrinsic to part of this discussion, it's the challenges associated with reduced staffing.",134,,
688,0.97,5985.012,6007.668,"Given that it is going to be reflected, that reality is reflected throughout these reports and I think it's really important, as a level setting efforts, that the Council fully funded the 2021 hiring plan during the budget process.",134,,
689,0.97,6007.668,6011.405,"With that, I turn it over to Greg.",134,,
690,0.97,6011.405,6013.741,"Thank you, Madam chair.",135,,
691,0.97,6013.741,6014.074,Good morning.,135,,
692,0.97,6014.074,6022.249,"As the chair just said, I will present to you the quarter one SPD budget and staffing report and there is a lot of information.",135,,
693,0.97,6022.249,6024.685,We've got about 25 slides.,135,,
694,0.97,6024.685,6029.323,I'm going to try to go through it as quickly as I can.,135,,
695,0.97,6029.323,6031.725,"In some ways, it is data intensive.",135,,
696,0.97,6031.725,6041.902,I asked that you jump up and verbally let me know if you have a question because I may not be able to see it.,135,,
697,0.97,6041.902,6051.345,"Allie, would you mind flipping to the first slide?",135,,
698,0.97,6051.345,6060.154,We will cover four areas and each is guided by a Council statement of legislative attack and I will go over them quickly.,135,,
699,0.97,6060.154,6083.21,"Spd zero zero one a zero zero three is on financial reporting and the Council had requested monthly financial reports that required extensive and went over various budget categories and also, on excess pay, meaning pay received over $150,000 and to request for pretty much every single expenditure SPD makes.",135,,
700,0.97,6083.21,6108.836,"We will go into a number of these data today and will not be going into excess pay reporting because we mostly are focusing on the first quarter and we are not getting to the point where many folks in SPD will be approaching $150,000 in compensation, with the exception of command staff and some civilians.",135,,
701,0.97,6108.836,6112.84,It's the case where overtime plays into compensation for the officers.,135,,
702,0.97,6112.84,6122.783,We are early in the year to know how that is progressing.,135,,
703,0.97,6122.783,6125.786,We will touch at matt today and won't touch too deeply on every single financial expenditure.,135,,
704,0.97,6125.786,6130.858,There are well over 1000 in the first quarter.,135,,
705,0.97,6130.858,6143.637,What I would mention is that Council members have voiced interest in expenditures being made around body armor and weapons and things that might be classified as Militarization.,135,,
706,0.97,6143.637,6159.953,"There is a Demilitarization response with the Department sending that in the next month and hopefully, that will cover many of the questions about the SPD expenditures in those areas.",135,,
707,0.97,6159.953,6167.661,"If it does not, the committee can dive into it later but given all the things we have to cover today, we won't move into that area.",135,,
708,0.97,6167.661,6170.23,The second thing we will cover will be the use of overtime.,135,,
709,0.97,6170.23,6211.505,"The third thing we will cover will be staffing . When we go into staffing, we will go into the precinct staffing and 911 response and the fourth and we cover will be response time and as well, we will look at priority call responses . the way SPD is trying to triage, if you will, it's 911 responses so they can, as best as they can, maintain quality 911 response times.",135,,
710,0.97,6211.505,6213.307,"In a questions on that slide, please shout out.",135,,
711,0.97,6213.307,6217.611,"Otherwise, I will move into the presentation.",135,,
712,0.97,6217.611,6217.811,Okay.,135,,
713,0.97,6217.811,6221.415,We will start off with Finance monitoring.,135,,
714,0.97,6221.415,6224.585,We start out with the biggest expenditures.,135,,
715,0.97,6224.585,6239.733,"Council members are probably used to hearing me talk about how the budget is pretty much all salary, benefits, over time and allocated costs.",135,,
716,0.97,6239.733,6243.07,That's a reminder that it is pretty much the case.,135,,
717,0.97,6243.07,6255.616,"With this slide is showing is the largest expenditures, those three and then it shows the difference between the first quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021.",135,,
718,0.97,6255.616,6262.055,"As you can see, at a sort of high level, spending has gone down by 11% from last year, fairly significant.",135,,
719,0.97,6262.055,6279.239,The other big picture take away from this slide is that over time has have . It was about 8% of expenditures this time last year and this year it is 4%.,135,,
720,0.97,6279.239,6292.786,There is a pandemic going on that was not going on in January and February of last year and that is some of the reason that that piece has gone down but not the only reason.,135,,
721,0.97,6292.786,6303.997,"Diving deeper, we will move to the next slide.",135,,
722,0.97,6303.997,6309.703,The next slide is the larger expenditures and how they look against budget.,135,,
723,0.97,6309.703,6321.114,"You are seeing on the left-hand side, the 2020 adopted budget in Q1.",135,,
724,0.97,6321.114,6332.426,It gives you a picture of what the Department is spending and how it measures against the budget.,135,,
725,0.97,6332.426,6346.673,"I would note that it would be really easy to say this is a quarterly budget and therefore, everything that the Department is spending right now should be about 25% of their total budgets.",135,,
726,0.97,6346.673,6350.043,Not necessarily true with SPD for two regions.,135,,
727,0.97,6350.043,6370.03,"The first is that a lot of the SPD work is seasonal and when we talk about overtime, overtime is not something that they should really be at 25% of, at this point in time of something that builds up over the summer time.",135,,
728,0.97,6370.03,6378.038,"Even something as simple as salary and benefits, you would think it would be something easily divisible by four for 25%.",135,,
729,0.97,6378.038,6393.153,"In this case, the city pay cycles are such that through March, actually, we would expect SPD would have spent about 27% of its budget on salary and benefits.",135,,
730,0.97,6393.153,6397.691,Why is that important?,135,,
731,0.97,6397.691,6410.17,"Because of the fact that they've only spent 25% of their budget on salary and benefits, shows that there is a salary savings.",135,,
732,0.97,6410.17,6414.808,"As we get further into the presentation, we will talk about that salary savings.",135,,
733,0.97,6414.808,6428.221,"So, as I said earlier, the last thing on this slide is, as you can see, overtime is about half of what it was last year.",135,,
734,0.97,6428.221,6437.631,"If there are no questions on this slide, I will keep motoring through.",135,,
735,0.97,6437.631,6438.532,Okay.,135,,
736,0.97,6438.532,6447.841,"So, the next slide is showing, at a high level, all of the other expenditures that SPD is making throughout the year.",135,,
737,0.97,6447.841,6466.827,We are talking about a very low percentage of budgets . The big three categories are making up 96 or 97% of expenditures and we are talking about everything else being a whopping 3% or 4% of expenditures.,135,,
738,0.97,6466.827,6477.27,We have a variety of categories and I think the Council is mostly familiar with the budget exercises last summer but I will hit them at a high level.,135,,
739,0.97,6477.27,6485.879,"What you are seeing before you is services, consultant, legal and other and it is the second category.",135,,
740,0.97,6485.879,6488.081,I will start with separation pay.,135,,
741,0.97,6488.081,6497.524,"It's exactly what you think it is, it is the pay the Department provides to officers who have separated or are leaving service.",135,,
742,0.97,6497.524,6505.098,This is compensation the officers are owed when their vacation is paid out or COMP time is paid out.,135,,
743,0.97,6505.098,6524.718,"As most folks are aware, there have been a large number of officers leaving the Department recently and that's why you see the difference between Q1 of 2020 and Q1 of 2021 with separation pay a significant expenditure for the Department at this point in time.",135,,
744,0.97,6524.718,6528.855,"We will be diving into that, as well.",135,,
745,0.97,6528.855,6542.102,"Really quickly on the other categories, just to refresh everyone's memory, the services consultant, legal and other category, the Orange category, they are mostly contracts for service SPD has.",135,,
746,0.97,6542.102,6548.909,The largest is the red light cameras and that is well over half of that entire category.,135,,
747,0.97,6548.909,6579.973,"The other charges, which is the one at the very bottom, the green category, that pays for things like building rentals and the OPA office for the evidence warehouse and it also pays for things like fuel and the entire budget, not very big, 1.2% of the entire adopted budget.",135,,
748,0.97,6579.973,6595.188,"Discretionary purchases are used to buy uniforms, guns, office supplies and even water supplied for special events.",135,,
749,0.97,6595.188,6599.759,"That particular slice of the entire budget is really small, a little over 80%.",135,,
750,0.97,6599.759,6607.5,"Then, travel and training is pretty much what it sounds like.",135,,
751,0.97,6607.5,6609.336,"That one is budgeted at about $900,000 for the entire year, less than 1%.",135,,
752,0.97,6609.336,6613.473,"Any questions, please let me know.",135,,
753,0.97,6613.473,6622.882,I will move to the next slide.,135,,
754,0.97,6622.882,6623.083,Okay.,135,,
755,0.97,6623.083,6626.019,Let's move to the next slide.,135,,
756,0.97,6626.019,6633.927,What you are seeing here is a breakdown of how those expenditures look against the budget.,135,,
757,0.97,6633.927,6643.436,"Again, on the left-hand side, you see Q1 of 2020 and the right is Q1 of 2021 with separation pay not so good.",135,,
758,0.97,6643.436,6653.847,"Separation pay was budgeted this year at $898,000 and as you can see, the separation pay through the first quarter is already $1.5 million and that is the only area running over budget.",135,,
759,0.97,6653.847,6660.72,Everything else is relatively under budget.,135,,
760,0.97,6660.72,6661.388,Capitol is a bit of an anomaly.,135,,
761,0.97,6661.388,6670.03,Capitol is expenditures around things like I.T.,135,,
762,0.97,6670.03,6680.173,"And you would think an agency like SPD doesn't have capital and that is largely true, $6000 of things that get categorized as I.T.",135,,
763,0.97,6680.173,6688.715,And other things that might fall into a capital description but aren't Brick-And-Mortar.,135,,
764,0.97,6688.715,6699.426,The other areas have discretionary purposes and everything is down compared to 2020.,135,,
765,0.97,6699.426,6705.065,"One of the reasons that is significant, not just down numerically, but with discretionary purchases, down $876,000.",135,,
766,0.97,6705.065,6710.67,"Last year it was $981,000.",135,,
767,0.97,6710.67,6722.348,"It's down numerically and what is important to note is that these categories received, many of them, reductions in the adopted budget.",135,,
768,0.97,6722.348,6729.089,"The fact that SPD is running under budget, running under a budget that was reduced.",135,,
769,0.97,6729.089,6737.664,That is their attempt to be good for school stewards.,135,,
770,0.97,6737.664,6740.4,"If there are no questions on that one, I'm going a lot faster than I thought I was going to.",135,,
771,0.97,6740.4,6743.636,Let's move to overtime.,135,,
772,0.97,6743.636,6749.843,All right.,135,,
773,0.97,6749.843,6757.016,"As I discussed a moment ago, overtime spending is down considerably in 2021, about half of what it was last year.",135,,
774,0.97,6757.016,6764.524,"In this chart, which you can see is the first quarter of 2020 when compared with the first quarter of 2019 in the first quarter of 2020.",135,,
775,0.97,6764.524,6779.839,"These are the smaller overtime expenditure areas and we are measuring in hours, not dollars.",135,,
776,0.97,6779.839,6791.151,"What you can see is that, once again, overtime is down, as you would expect in just about every single area.",135,,
777,0.97,6791.151,6802.295,"It's disproportionately down in some areas like criminal investigations and you can see when comparing against 2019 or 2020, it is half, a little more than half, weigh down.",135,,
778,0.97,6802.295,6817.076,"You can see that against the miscellaneous category in 2021 and 2020, it is tiny.",135,,
779,0.97,6817.076,6826.352,"I think there was a question during public testimony about what is in that miscellaneous category and what is in the category, with the presentation, it's not a lot.",135,,
780,0.97,6826.352,6845.572,There are emphasis patrols which the city had funded at a higher level in 2020 and the Department used a lot of emphasis hours and 2020 and the first quarter because that is when the shooting happened on Pike and pine.,135,,
781,0.97,6845.572,6852.946,That's why the green 2020 bar is so high.,135,,
782,0.97,6852.946,6864.624,"This year, in the 2021 budget, emphasis patrols were largely Defunded and there is not really any spending or use of hours there.",135,,
783,0.97,6864.624,6875.868,Other categories in miscellaneous are the Mayor's security and court.,135,,
784,0.97,6875.868,6886.212,"Both of those are relatively small categories, compared to all the other overtime categories.",135,,
785,0.97,6886.212,6888.848,"Hopefully, that Demystifies, a bit, what is in the miscellaneous category.",135,,
786,0.97,6888.848,6889.182,Thank you.,136,,
787,0.97,6889.182,6900.894,I have one other question that was prompted from public comment.,136,,
788,0.97,6900.894,6932.625,"Anticipating the question about the miscellaneous category, there was a comment about the SPD overtime during the first quarter of 2021 compared to 2020 and 2019 in the chart regarding the categories that are lower with events that include demonstrations in the public comment noted that the first quarter of 2020 would be large scale protests.",136,,
789,0.97,6932.625,6935.728,For the future quarterly reports?,136,,
790,0.97,6935.728,6937.83,Let's move to that slide.,137,,
791,0.97,6937.83,6942.902,That is the next one.,137,,
792,0.97,6942.902,6949.742,What you are seeing here is that overtime hours are broken down by the three categories that actually are typically larger.,137,,
793,0.97,6949.742,6961.22,"But, these are particularly interesting because these are areas affected by the pandemic and these are areas of Council interest.",137,,
794,0.97,6961.22,6969.028,"As you mentioned, the spending or use some hours around demonstrations.",137,,
795,0.97,6969.028,6986.879,"What you are talking about, Councilmember Herbold, I think it's the middle area that says events including Seattle center.",137,,
796,0.97,6986.879,6992.251,"What is notable about this, the Department Classifies these hours as events, but they include demonstration expenditures.",137,,
797,0.97,6992.251,7004.163,"What you are seeing here, in 2021, there were hours used for demonstrations.",137,,
798,0.97,7004.163,7021.914,"They were not for events and there were Obviousy, in 2021, no events that SPD had to staff because of the pandemic but the Graybar pretty much exclusively represents demonstrations.",137,,
799,0.97,7021.914,7036.796,"There were, I think, $17,000 or more spent for a snow event but that area was for demonstrations and it adds up to, I believe, $345,000, that Graybar.",137,,
800,0.97,7036.796,7038.765,Is that getting at your question?,137,,
801,0.97,7038.765,7039.966,It absolutely is.,138,,
802,0.97,7039.966,7040.767,Thank you.,138,,
803,0.97,7040.767,7085.545,"The other thing I would point out about the overtime hours in these three areas is that patrol operations is up in 2021 and that is the only area of overtime spending or overtime use, in this case, hours, that is up anywhere in the Department and it was high last year . 911 response across these three areas in 2019, 2020 and 2021, the number of officers doesn't change a lot and we will get into that with deployable staff.",139,,
804,0.97,7085.545,7101.094,Staff that can be deployed is something different these days than in prior years and that may be partially what is driving the overtime use and there may be other factors and standards the Department is putting into place.,139,,
805,0.97,7101.094,7106.099,We will get into that later.,139,,
806,0.97,7106.099,7106.499,Shall I move on?,139,,
807,0.97,7106.499,7107.133,Please.,140,,
808,0.97,7107.133,7120.613,"Spd staffing, so--SPD does not provide projections anymore in the staffing reports.",140,,
809,0.97,7120.613,7138.631,"Historically, SPD has provided staffing reports that show Actuals to date and then the project anywhere between one to two years out.",140,,
810,0.97,7138.631,7143.236,"Historically, and has been predictable about how many folks would be hired in and how many would separate.",140,,
811,0.97,7143.236,7152.044,"That is not at all predictable, now.",140,,
812,0.97,7152.044,7156.649,It is something that the Department feels very uncomfortable about projecting.,140,,
813,0.97,7156.649,7161.42,"They are, at this point, sending to the Council only Actuals.",140,,
814,0.97,7161.42,7166.559,"Greg, is that for both new hires and separations, they are not doing projections?",141,,
815,0.97,7166.559,7167.927,It is.,142,,
816,0.97,7167.927,7170.329,It is for both.,142,,
817,0.97,7170.329,7178.838,"Can you remind me that if they are not projecting separations, upon what is the separation pay budget based on?",143,,
818,0.97,7178.838,7188.281,I would have to answer that for you later.,144,,
819,0.97,7188.281,7194.82,My speculation--and are reserved for the right for the Department to correct me--it's based on historical levels of separation.,144,,
820,0.97,7194.82,7200.226,That is something that I will get back to you on.,144,,
821,0.97,7200.226,7200.593,All right.,145,,
822,0.97,7200.593,7200.86,Thank Yo.,145,,
823,0.97,7200.86,7215.174,"Without the Department providing any projections, it's difficult to know how the staffing picture will look throughout the year.",146,,
824,0.97,7215.174,7225.184,"In the past, the Council has asked central staff to do its best job to do some predicting about how staffing will look and that is what I have done, again.",146,,
825,0.97,7225.184,7240.499,"I had put together a staffing plan that assumes Actuals--doesn't assume--reflects Actuals from January through March, the first quarter.",146,,
826,0.97,7240.499,7249.442,"Going forward, from April to December, I make assumptions about hires and separations.",146,,
827,0.97,7249.442,7262.822,"Specifically, I assume there will be about eight hires per month and that is consistent with some of the higher levels of staffing and hiring that we've seen in the past couple of years, particularly 2019 comes to mind.",146,,
828,0.97,7262.822,7277.67,Eight hires per month would be originally consistent with what the Department thought it would be able to do this year.,146,,
829,0.97,7277.67,7280.94,I will get into more detail on that later.,146,,
830,0.97,7280.94,7286.312,The forecasts that I'm putting out there also assumes that they're going to be an average of nine separations per month.,146,,
831,0.97,7286.312,7291.984,That is a little bit higher than what we have seen in SPD in the past.,146,,
832,0.97,7291.984,7305.898,"When I say the past, I mean Pre- summer 2020 and usually officers left at about the pace of seven per month.",146,,
833,0.97,7305.898,7313.973,"Of course, now, as we know in the fall and as you will see continuing into the first quarter, they are leaving at well more than twice that rate.",146,,
834,0.97,7313.973,7319.278,We will get into that later.,146,,
835,0.97,7319.278,7345.304,"The average of nine separations per month that was picked and the average of eight hires per month picked from my assumptions reflect the Council's staffing plan, which Councilmember Herbold said is fully funded and that is described in SPD 025 B zero zero two with their hiring plan completely funded.",146,,
836,0.97,7345.304,7355.681,I took the completely funded plan and I Subbed in the Actuals for the first months and made projections from there.,146,,
837,0.97,7355.681,7362.421,"Hopefully, that makes sense.",146,,
838,0.97,7362.421,7363.889,Moving onto the next slide.,146,,
839,0.97,7363.889,7375.034,"So, looking at the first quarter, what it means is that I took Actuals and I Subbed that in.",146,,
840,0.97,7375.034,7383.542,That means there were 52 trained officers that left in the first quarter and there were 58 total separations.,146,,
841,0.97,7383.542,7396.422,"The difference between the 58 and the 52 are that some officers that were in training or some were recruits, dropped out and that's why we see some difference there.",146,,
842,0.97,7396.422,7400.092,"But, we are seeing total separations of 58.",146,,
843,0.97,7400.092,7418.043,"When we talk about seven per month or nine per month, obviously, you can see in the big picture context when we talk about 58 in three months, obviously, nine is low and seven is very low, in terms of historic averages.",146,,
844,0.97,7418.043,7420.646,"On the hiring side, you can see that there were 30 hires made in the first quarter.",146,,
845,0.97,7420.646,7447.64,"That is because there were a number of folks that were either hired or in the hiring process and last year in the fall, when the Academy shutdown due to the pandemic or over the summer and SPD stopped hiring, they banked a number of those recruits.",146,,
846,0.97,7447.64,7461.253,"By doing so in January when they started hiring again and sending it to the Academy, they had a bit of a backlog and there were 21 folks ready to go and they organized with the Seattle class and sent all 21.",146,,
847,0.97,7461.253,7475.0,"At the time that the forecast was being put together, the Council forecast, and the forecast that central staff did, we knew those 21 would happen in January.",146,,
848,0.97,7475.0,7485.444,They were assumed in the hiring plan with nothing significant there.,146,,
849,0.97,7485.444,7501.427,"As you can see, in the lines, and you've seen this graph before, the top one is fully trained officers and you are seeing the number of officers that could be deployed . They have exited the student officer ranks and can answer 911 calls on their own.",146,,
850,0.97,7501.427,7510.903,The second line you are seeing is officers in service and those are the number of officers that can be deployed.,146,,
851,0.97,7510.903,7536.328,"The difference are able to be deployed in the difference between the two is that there were about 118, on average, over the first quarter with officers out on long term leave, either a disability leave, administrative, family leave.",146,,
852,0.97,7536.328,7551.644,"So, those 110 officers that were out are not deployable and when the Department is looking to figure out what the street strength is, if you will, it will look more to the gray line than to the blue line.",146,,
853,0.97,7551.644,7558.417,I will ask if there's any questions on that before I move on.,146,,
854,0.97,7558.417,7561.787,That number of officers is decreasing.,147,,
855,0.97,7561.787,7568.961,The number of officers who are fully trained but not in service.,147,,
856,0.97,7568.961,7586.078,It went from 1094 to 1090 and got a little worse in Q1 but this is an area the Department is giving projections on and so they are --,148,,
857,0.97,7586.078,7589.481,Eyes sea.,149,,
858,0.97,7589.481,7590.416,That's projected after the fourth quarter?,149,,
859,0.97,7590.416,7597.59,"For the first quarter, you will see that number will get a little better.",150,,
860,0.97,7597.59,7608.634,There are fewer officers out on administrative leave and that is the Department's belief.,150,,
861,0.97,7608.634,7617.409,That is based on the amount of time that the officers are out?,151,,
862,0.97,7617.409,7617.776,Pretty much.,152,,
863,0.97,7617.776,7637.896,I know officer a will be out for a month and officer B will be out and they will provide this projection based on some actual information about the individual instances of officers taking leave?,153,,
864,0.97,7637.896,7638.464,Yeah.,154,,
865,0.97,7638.464,7660.119,"They provide some of that data to us and we know there are about 30%, 29% on workers COMP issues and there's about 45% out on a sort of a general category of sick or accrued benefits and there's about 18% out on administrative leave.",154,,
866,0.97,7660.119,7665.724,"To the extent that they know when those particular kinds of leaves will end, they can predict or project how that in service line is going to look.",154,,
867,0.97,7665.724,7675.968,Thank you.,155,,
868,0.97,7678.037,7682.875,"For the next slide on SPD staffing, what does it mean from a money perspective?",155,,
869,0.97,7682.875,7696.188,"Obviously, it is probably big news that 58% of officers left in the first quarter and it does have the financial impact on the departments.",155,,
870,0.97,7696.188,7745.804,"It means at the very highest level, the annual average FTE, the funding for officers, student officers and recruits and every sworn or near term sworn or or Soon-To-Be sworn officer is in that line, it was originally funded at 1343 in the adopted budget and if you look at the central staff estimate, assuming about nine folks will leave per month for the rest of the year and assuming there will be about eight hires for the rest of the year, per month, we would expect the FTE will get down to about 1251, 92 positions fewer than our funded adopted budget.",155,,
871,0.97,7745.804,7747.506,"When I say positions, I say FTE.",155,,
872,0.97,7747.506,7748.507,It's about 92 fewer than funded in the budget.,155,,
873,0.97,7748.507,7767.226,"What that means is that if there projections that I've made are accurate, at the end of the year, the Department will have about $13 million in salary savings.",155,,
874,0.97,7767.226,7783.842,"If you wanted to take a really conservative look and you go back to historical separations and you say, maybe it will be seven per month, instead of the nine average that I'm projecting, you can lower that salary savings down to about $11.5 million.",155,,
875,0.97,7783.842,7799.158,"I thought it would provide a range for folks with an idea about how the money would work, assuming seven separations or nine separations as the analysis assumes.",155,,
876,0.97,7799.158,7823.782,"If we wind up in this situation, at the end of the year, for officers in service having these numbers on the graph you just saw, and as projected outcome of the hiring will wind up being 100 to officers, not 114.",155,,
877,0.97,7823.782,7841.8,The Department was only able to hire four officers in each of the last two months in terms of new recruits.,155,,
878,0.97,7858.817,7869.761,The highest level of recruitment was 105 in 2019.,155,,
879,0.97,7872.13,7889.381,"Assuming the separations with the 58 that are showing in Q1 and the M9 that I assumed an average throughout the year, you can see 142 separations by the end of the year.",155,,
880,0.97,7889.381,7912.571,"I will ask if there is any questions on that and I emphasize that the Council funded 114 hires and if the agency is able to do that, the money is there, more than they are given the number of separations they have seen in the first quarter.",155,,
881,0.97,7912.571,7914.039,"Chair Herbold, I think Councilmember Morales may have a question.",156,,
882,0.97,7914.039,7920.012,Thank you.,157,,
883,0.97,7920.012,7926.485,"I just want to reiterate what I think you've said, Greg.",157,,
884,0.97,7926.485,7945.103,"While this slide, at first glance, looks like there is $13 million in salary savings due to separations, that is assuming that the rate of separations and new hires continues through the year and that would accrue by year-end.",157,,
885,0.97,7945.103,7945.704,It's not available right now?,157,,
886,0.97,7945.704,7949.641,That is correct.,158,,
887,0.97,7949.641,7953.612,That would accrue by year-end and is not available right now.,158,,
888,0.97,7953.612,7968.76,I think what we would have to see is that the separations would have to really go down to reach nine per month.,158,,
889,0.97,7968.76,7973.598,"As I say, there were 58, in total.",158,,
890,0.97,7973.598,7978.57,"52 fully trained officers and 58, in total, for the FIRS three months.",158,,
891,0.97,7978.57,7983.675,It has to go down from almost 20 to nine.,158,,
892,0.97,7983.675,7993.485,"That is to be able to--and if it doesn't--if it stays at the levels it is that now, more than 13 million will be seen by the end of the year.",158,,
893,0.97,7993.485,7993.752,Okay.,159,,
894,0.97,7993.752,7994.052,Thank you.,159,,
895,0.97,7994.052,8002.26,Okay.,160,,
896,0.97,8002.26,8009.634,"So, moving along, I will show what this might mean on the ground.",160,,
897,0.97,8009.634,8017.009,"Now, we will talk a little bit about increasing staffing and you've seen this table many times.",160,,
898,0.97,8017.009,8032.924,"This is, basically, 911 officers broken down by the various precincts . It's a category that they are using to fill in, where additional officers are needed in the various precincts.",160,,
899,0.97,8032.924,8047.806,"What is important about this particular slide, and I will get into this more in a moment, is that you really only see 911 officers here.",160,,
900,0.97,8047.806,8049.541,"There are three other categories, the Seattle center and the station master.",160,,
901,0.97,8049.541,8058.817,I would consider that more of security or support roles.,160,,
902,0.97,8058.817,8059.451,You've got 11 officers here.,160,,
903,0.97,8059.451,8072.164,Would you are not seeing is the Anti-Crime team or the community police team.,160,,
904,0.97,8072.164,8080.672,"Historically, there were, in this table, 34 Anti-Crime team officers and 28 community police team officers.",160,,
905,0.97,8080.672,8086.778,"That beat number was at 51 and when I say historically, if you look at the beginning of 2020, you would see those officers.",160,,
906,0.97,8086.778,8104.529,"Of course, what happened, as officers started separating, the chief had to move folks from those specialty Proactive positions into 911 response to keep 911 response times down.",160,,
907,0.97,8104.529,8114.105,We will flip to the next slide.,160,,
908,0.97,8114.105,8116.074,This gives you perspective for what I'm talking about.,160,,
909,0.97,8116.074,8130.655,"What you see here on the Left- hand side is the dates and these are point in time, August 2020 and September 2020, December and March over the last six months or so.",160,,
910,0.97,8130.655,8147.272,"The next column, total precinct staffing, this is a column representing what was there with everything, in terms of 911 officers, precinct support, Cpt, A.C.T.",160,,
911,0.97,8147.272,8147.906,And everything in that number.,160,,
912,0.97,8147.906,8166.658,"If you look at the first column, which is the total precinct staffing was 677 and of that number, there were 495 officers on the 911 calls.",160,,
913,0.97,8166.658,8172.497,There were 68 sergeants that were supervising those officers responding to 911 calls.,160,,
914,0.97,8172.497,8202.093,"What you see as we move through time into March, is that the precinct staffing number is going down . The 911 officer number is generally holding fairly constant with a massive bump between August and September and that is when the chief transferred in all of the Cpt active support officers into 911 response.",160,,
915,0.97,8202.093,8207.165,About 17 officers from outside of the precinct support.,160,,
916,0.97,8207.165,8221.346,"That beefed up that number to 591, the highest that 911 response has been in a long time.",160,,
917,0.97,8221.346,8233.525,"For the last 1.5 years, it has been more been more at the 495--and it was back to 466 if you look at 2019 when you talk about officers for the 911 response.",160,,
918,0.97,8233.525,8244.436,The chief bumped it to 591 and that had the effect of providing more resources for 911 calls.,160,,
919,0.97,8244.436,8256.281,"As the attrition started happening from September and moving forward, officers started leaving the Department and that started to affect precinct staffing.",160,,
920,0.97,8256.281,8281.439,"As that happened, the precinct number goes down and the chief is doing his best to hold the 911 response officers at about the 500 level and as we've reached March 2021, you can see that pretty much the only thing left of the total precinct staffing is the 911 response . I know that is a lot of information and I will stop and ask for questions.",160,,
921,0.97,8281.439,8286.578,I have a question.,161,,
922,0.97,8286.578,8288.847,"Is there a correlation, or do we know if there is a correlation?",161,,
923,0.97,8288.847,8305.397,Is it possible to know whether or not the attrition since September is attributable to the transfer from specialty units into 911?,161,,
924,0.97,8305.397,8315.206,"Is there a higher percentage, for instance, of officers that have left that are officers that have been transferred?",161,,
925,0.97,8315.206,8316.608,That is not something I know.,162,,
926,0.97,8316.608,8323.214,That is something I will ask the Department to get back to you on.,162,,
927,0.97,8323.214,8327.919,They have been keeping track of some of that information and I will get back to you and let you know.,162,,
928,0.97,8327.919,8344.436,My recollection is that it was a mix of older and newer officers.,162,,
929,0.97,8391.416,8406.965,"Some folks say they will come at a later time and more specifically, callers should call back at a later time.",162,,
930,0.97,8406.965,8431.289,"What I would highlight here, if you look at the description on the right-hand side, starting at about number three, communications will not dispatch to the narcotic activity, burglar alarms, priority three or priority four calls or calls that require only an officer to show up for a report.",162,,
931,0.97,8431.289,8436.628,"If someone calls 911 for those things, they will be told to call back at another time when staffing can be present.",162,,
932,0.97,8436.628,8454.612,The department keeps track of the number of times these things happen and the graph on the left shows the number of times they've had to go to priority response that is increasing.,162,,
933,0.97,8454.612,8463.254,"One thing I should note, the 2021 number is a year to date number and not first quarter.",162,,
934,0.97,8463.254,8482.373,It is through April 22 and the other thing I would NOTE is that it would not be accurate to take that number and do a straight line projection with it throughout the year to try to estimate what happened at the end of 2021.,162,,
935,0.97,8482.373,8493.585,"911 calls and a lot of the work that has to be done is seasonal and, obviously, they were at the quieter time of year, if you will.",162,,
936,0.97,8493.585,8511.302,"Quiet is probably being the holidays and I will have to ask Dr. Fisher but the point being, you can't take the 84 and figure out what the remaining days are and do the math and find the number.",162,,
937,0.97,8511.302,8511.536,Okay.,162,,
938,0.97,8511.536,8512.77,Moving on.,162,,
939,0.97,8512.77,8518.009,What you are seeing here is the 911 response times that the Department has provided.,162,,
940,0.97,8518.009,8527.218,"As you can see, it went up by all response times, going up since 2019.",162,,
941,0.97,8527.218,8534.626,"With the exception, I believe, of the South.",162,,
942,0.97,8534.626,8537.462,That went slightly down from 2020 to 2021 in the first quarter.,162,,
943,0.97,8537.462,8550.008,This is Apples-To-Apples and we are looking at Q1 of this year compared with Q1 of 2020 and 2019.,162,,
944,0.97,8550.008,8557.348,These calls have generally gone up across the board.,162,,
945,0.97,8557.348,8561.286,Everything else has gone up on priority two.,162,,
946,0.97,8561.286,8569.627,"The context, the goal for priority one is seven minutes and four priority two, 15?",163,,
947,0.97,8569.627,8572.196,Priority two is totally escaping me and I will have to get back to you on that one.,164,,
948,0.97,8572.196,8582.64,I believe you are correct that it had been seven minutes on priority one.,164,,
949,0.97,8582.64,8583.541,I will get back to you on both of those.,164,,
950,0.97,8583.541,8588.079,Thank you.,165,,
951,0.97,8588.079,8623.014,"The next thing I want to cover, now that we are through most of the reports that SPD sent, is the Provisos the Council has enacted on SPD and the reason it's important is because this affects the SPD finances and the ability to use their budgets as the Council provides us to restrict the budget for a number of different purposes . I will remind the committee of what those restrictions are and start with slide number 20.",166,,
952,0.97,8623.014,8662.053,"As you can see, the first proviso with this is its $2.5 million and the idea is that this money is being held out of the SPD budget . they cannot spend the appropriation until authorized by a future ordinance and the idea being that the city is pursuing the potential of having officers who have been accused of misconduct and, potentially, having those officers be Prioritized for a layoff.",166,,
953,0.97,8662.053,8678.436,"That is something that, if it ultimately doesn't come to fruition, something the Council would consider restoring that $2.5 million.",166,,
954,0.97,8678.436,8679.604,"Moving to the second one, it's a salary savings proviso.",166,,
955,0.97,8679.604,8693.985,"The Council rightly anticipated that due to the number of folks that were separating from SPD, that there would be salary savings.",166,,
956,0.97,8693.985,8698.489,There is a proviso holding $5 million that says that money can't be spent until future ordinance.,166,,
957,0.97,8698.489,8716.607,The Council established an intent and that proviso to transfer some funding to finance general to be used for Participatory Bunching.,166,,
958,0.97,8716.607,8721.245,They say any such transfer would be adjusted Accordingly was spending restrictions imposed by that proviso.,166,,
959,0.97,8721.245,8725.817,That's another $5 million that the Department has to not plan on having.,166,,
960,0.97,8725.817,8747.472,"Then, switching to number three, the harbor patrol proviso was holding $555,000 aside, Prioritizing the report on what harbor functions might be transferable either to the fire Department or the new community of safety and communications center.",166,,
961,0.97,8747.472,8766.557,"As long as that report is submitted to the Council, hopefully by the due date of May 24th, the Council would consider restoring that money into the SPD budget.",166,,
962,0.97,8766.557,8782.507,"The last one is the travel and training proviso, holding up about $700,000 of funding for travel and training and what is notable is the entire travel and training budget is only about $900,000 and that holds a large chunk of the travel and training budget.",166,,
963,0.97,8782.507,8795.787,"When I say travel and training, you should NOTE it's not training for De-Escalation or officer skills.",166,,
964,0.97,8795.787,8806.13,That kind of training is in professional standards and this is more professional or Certificatio kind of training including the things civilians might go to or certification things officers might go to.,166,,
965,0.97,8806.13,8816.274,Not the kind of training that is mandated by the consent decree.,166,,
966,0.97,8816.274,8817.875,That stuff is all in a different area.,166,,
967,0.97,8817.875,8840.932,"As long as the Department submits a report on travel and training, this one, the Council will not have to act again and hopefully, that happens soon with the report supposed to be due on March 31 and the Mayor's office in the last presentation said that was coming soon.",166,,
968,0.97,8840.932,8851.209,The proviso self releases with the Harvard patrol proviso requiring action for the Council?,167,,
969,0.97,8851.209,8852.51,Correct.,168,,
970,0.97,8852.51,8867.992,"The salary savings proviso, the $5 million proviso, can you Úremind me how we would propose to address that in the budget reduction bill that we've been discussing in committee?",169,,
971,0.97,8867.992,8883.274,"In the amendment that you propose, chair, and the committee voted to replace the original bill, I should note that the amendment hasn't been voted out, yet.",170,,
972,0.97,8883.274,8883.574,Correct.,171,,
973,0.97,8883.574,8907.265,"The amendment would essentially release the salary savings proviso and does require that the Department send, continue to send staffing reports and would release the $5 million hold as long as the Department sends staffing reports.",172,,
974,0.97,8907.265,8907.932,Pending the staffing report?,173,,
975,0.97,8907.932,8908.366,That's correct.,174,,
976,0.97,8908.366,8916.574,Thank you.,175,,
977,0.97,8916.574,8917.508,"So, to summarize, key Takeaways.",176,,
978,0.97,8917.508,8918.109,The first one seems obvious.,176,,
979,0.97,8918.109,8937.628,Staffing is a challenge . I went into a bit of detail with the precincts because I wanted to point out that the biggest change has been that SPD has lost its Proactive patrol positions.,176,,
980,0.97,8937.628,8942.633,"911 response has not changed a lot, as you can see in the data.",176,,
981,0.97,8942.633,8943.034,A.C.T.,176,,
982,0.97,8943.034,8952.009,And Cpt had pretty much been eliminated and beat officers that were at 51 are now at 11.,176,,
983,0.97,8952.009,8959.016,"The department would say that the staffing challenges are contributing to priority call handling occurrences, those being Trending upwards.",176,,
984,0.97,8959.016,8960.651,"As we know, the higher separations continue.",176,,
985,0.97,8960.651,8973.597,Nearly every category of overtime and discretionary spending is down compared to 2020.,176,,
986,0.97,8973.597,8989.613,"W know the exceptions are patrol Augmentation and separation pay and what is notable is that everything else is down in many cases, numerically, meaning spending was less than, fewer dollars, than last year.",176,,
987,0.97,8989.613,9001.258,"The budget was also lower and in many instances, the percentage of spending as a percentage of budget is also down.",176,,
988,0.97,9001.258,9013.904,The Department is doing what they can to be good fiscal stores and adhere to the Council's pledge.,176,,
989,0.97,9013.904,9029.086,"Number three, salary savings may reach $13 million and we talked fairly extensively about the assumptions central staff have made that would require coming to fruition to be able to get to $13 million in 2021.",176,,
990,0.97,9029.086,9067.725,"I would note that the Department has said that the salary savings is something they would like to rely on for fixing the separation pay budget issue with new civilian positions they are interested in and technolgy investments, all of which are recognized and would be funded with salary savings under the amendment that the public safety committee has chosen to substitute for Council bill 119981.",176,,
991,0.97,9067.725,9073.197,The city Council has also indicated an interest in Recouping some of those salary savings with Participatory budgeting.,176,,
992,0.97,9073.197,9074.432,That would also happen under the amendment I just spoke to.,176,,
993,0.97,9074.432,9093.017,"Lastly, the Provisos that I went through our holding about $8.5 million of expenditure authority that the Department would ultimately need to have restored if they were to be able to use their entire bunch.",176,,
994,0.97,9093.017,9096.954,I've covered a lot.,176,,
995,0.97,9096.954,9104.595,I will ask if there are any questions.,176,,
996,0.97,9104.595,9115.573,I am not seeing virtual hands or real hands.,177,,
997,0.97,9116.173,9117.141,This is very helpful.,177,,
998,0.97,9117.141,9152.076,"Finally, as context, I think, for considering the SPD budget reduction bill that aims to both align with our commitment to reducing $2021 to address the Overspend of overtime in 2020, but also working to fund the shared priorities that Council has with SPD for some of the salary savings.",177,,
999,0.97,9152.076,9189.079,"So, I think that even though we had to pause in the deliberations of that bill because of the need to allow the monitor to receive responses to the questions it had asked of SPD, the use of this analysis during the time of that pause, I think, is going to service us well when we take that build back up again.",177,,
1000,0.97,9189.079,9191.549,"With that, I say thanks again.",177,,
1001,0.97,9191.549,9192.95,Thank you.,178,,
1002,0.97,9192.95,9195.185,I really appreciate it.,179,,
1003,0.97,9195.185,9201.058,"Clark, can you please read the final item into the agenda?",179,,
1004,0.97,9201.058,9206.397,"Item three, human services Department update on safe and driving communities and victim advocate transfer.",180,,
1005,0.97,9206.397,9206.897,Thank you so much.,181,,
1006,0.97,9206.897,9224.582,I appreciate being joined here by the human services Department and I want to ask Amy if you want to do a quick Intro or to Orient us to the presentation?,181,,
1007,0.97,9224.582,9225.516,Absolutely.,182,,
1008,0.97,9225.516,9228.185,"Good afternoon, Council members.",182,,
1009,0.97,9228.185,9237.728,My name is Amy Gore from the Council step in the final item on the agenda is a presentation on the driving division of the human services Department.,182,,
1010,0.97,9237.728,9242.533,A new division established in the 2021 budget.,182,,
1011,0.97,9242.533,9260.684,"As mentioned earlier, the division includes community safety programs and the Mayor's office on domestic violence, traditionally housed in the human services Department and as well, the crime victims advocate support team, transferred to Hst from Seattle police.",182,,
1012,0.97,9260.684,9263.22,Hst will speak to the new division and the status of those transfers.,182,,
1013,0.97,9263.22,9264.755,"With that, I will turn it over to Tanya Kim.",182,,
1014,0.97,9264.755,9266.857,Thank you.,183,,
1015,0.97,9266.857,9271.595,I'm assuming that Lily will pull up the slide deck.,183,,
1016,0.97,9271.595,9286.577,"I'm Tanya Kim, interim deputy director of the human services Department.",183,,
1017,0.97,9286.577,9288.679,"I'm Dana Lockhart, manager of the survivor services unit in the human services division.",184,,
1018,0.97,9288.679,9290.247,Great.,185,,
1019,0.97,9290.247,9292.282,Thank you.,185,,
1020,0.97,9292.282,9302.693,I know that we are short on time and forgive me if I'm rushing through some items.,185,,
1021,0.97,9302.693,9306.497,I'm always happy to come back.,185,,
1022,0.97,9306.497,9318.809,"Today, we are going to provide an overview of the Hst safe and thriving communities division and Dana, my colleague, will do a deeper dive on the crime survivor unit transferred from the Seattle police Department.",185,,
1023,0.97,9318.809,9322.279,Next.,185,,
1024,0.97,9322.279,9330.688,One more.,185,,
1025,0.97,9330.688,9345.602,"Hsd has four divisions and we have our leadership and administration, aging and disability services, youth and family and homelessness strategy and investments, Transitioning to the regional homelessness authority.",185,,
1026,0.97,9345.602,9361.685,"The new safe and thriving communities division consolidates the Hst existing safety efforts and includes the crime survivor services unit with approximately 30 staff and like other divisions within Hst, will function as a Funder, direct service provider and convene her.",185,,
1027,0.97,9361.685,9369.393,We are in the process of standing up the division and one of the first orders of businesses hiring our division director and that posting is live.,185,,
1028,0.97,9369.393,9383.173,"We hope to have the person in place at the end of May, if not June.",185,,
1029,0.97,9383.173,9401.458,"There are three distinct units within the safety division and the first is community safety investments, which is responsible for the request for proposals and contracts with Community-Based organizations who support youth, adults and families harmed by the criminal legal system.",185,,
1030,0.97,9401.458,9405.929,You will see our community safety investments in that unit.,185,,
1031,0.97,9405.929,9421.578,We have our Mayor's office on domestic violence and sexual assault as a Funder and convene her and they focus on Gender- based services and support survivors at risk of Gender- based violence with Community- based services to maintain and support their safety.,185,,
1032,0.97,9421.578,9444.001,"Modvsa leads the response to the violence and finally, we have the crime survivor services unit which my colleague will describe later on this presentation.",185,,
1033,0.97,9446.003,9482.172,"With the contract in the division, I'm sorry, but as it relates to your description of the community safety investment, that support for youth, adults and families harmed by the criminal legal system through various supports and services, we've talked about these investments and this is an area where the Council, together with the executive, have worked to increase these investments.",185,,
1034,0.97,9482.172,9487.044,"Doesn't this category include investments meant to create safety before exposure to the criminal legal system, as well?",185,,
1035,0.97,9487.044,9487.277,Yes.,186,,
1036,0.97,9487.277,9496.854,"If the outcomes of the measure are tied to community safety, yes.",186,,
1037,0.97,9496.854,9508.098,"But, with the human services Department, we also have the youth and family empowerment division that is going upstream to great conditions of Well- being.",186,,
1038,0.97,9508.098,9514.805,"The youth development, the food and food and nutrition, et cetera, that's in that division.",186,,
1039,0.97,9514.805,9518.108,That's what you mean by that before.,186,,
1040,0.97,9518.108,9518.408,Yes.,187,,
1041,0.97,9518.408,9541.865,"Moving to the next slide, I have a quick preview of the contract that might help articulate it a little bit, with a finer point that in the community safety, in that unit that you are pointing to, the Councilmember is about $22 million of investments and that does include the recent Council ads.",188,,
1042,0.97,9541.865,9549.306,It also includes the active community safety capacity building Rfp in progress.,188,,
1043,0.97,9549.306,9562.252,"We will give a presentation on that that, once the Rfp is done and there is about $9.4 million in Gender-Based violence.",188,,
1044,0.97,9562.252,9570.961,"Together, those will be the investments that we have within the division.",188,,
1045,0.97,9570.961,9575.198,"With that, we want to do a deeper dive on the crime survivor services unit.",188,,
1046,0.97,9575.198,9584.374,I'm going to reintroduce Dana to take over.,188,,
1047,0.97,9584.374,9589.079,I lost my mute button.,189,,
1048,0.97,9589.079,9589.379,Thank you.,189,,
1049,0.97,9589.379,9592.583,I've lost my notes.,189,,
1050,0.97,9592.583,9597.754,Too many screens.,189,,
1051,0.97,9597.754,9602.859,"Now, it's locked behind my notes.",189,,
1052,0.97,9602.859,9605.095,I apologize.,189,,
1053,0.97,9605.095,9608.098,Here we go.,189,,
1054,0.97,9608.098,9610.033,"Thank you, Tanya.",189,,
1055,0.97,9610.033,9623.88,The creation of the crime survivors services unit does align with the city of Seattle's commitment to Reimagine public safety.,189,,
1056,0.97,9623.88,9657.547,"As you know, council passed legislation last year that transferred all of the victim advocacy services out of the Seattle police Department read our unit serves crime survivors of 11 different crime types and that is domestic violence, elder abuse, sexual assault, child abuse, Internet crimes against children, commercial sexual exploitation of children, human trafficking, robbery, hate crimes, assault and Homicide.",189,,
1057,0.97,9657.547,9672.696,"While we create a singular unit for all victim advocacy services, it's our intent to continue to maintain specialized professional expertise in the specific crime type.",189,,
1058,0.97,9672.696,9684.541,The crime victim advocates will remain Colocated within the investigative units within the Seattle police Department and they will also be working with the chief County Prosecutor's office.,189,,
1059,0.97,9684.541,9699.489,This Colocation is important to ensure that survivors of the crimes are met with a Trauma- informed survivor centered response early on in the criminal investigation process.,189,,
1060,0.97,9699.489,9705.195,Their voices and wishes are heard at all stages of the investigation and criminal proceedings and their rights as crime survivors are protected.,189,,
1061,0.97,9705.195,9712.069,Next slide.,189,,
1062,0.97,9712.069,9722.813,"As previously mentioned, crime survivor services is two programs and the first is the victim support team.",189,,
1063,0.97,9722.813,9734.291,This is made up of roughly 60 community volunteers that provides a mobile trauma response and advocacy with crisis intervention.,189,,
1064,0.97,9734.291,9738.428,They respond primarily on the weekends to domestic violence calls and the sexual assault crime scenes.,189,,
1065,0.97,9738.428,9749.272,This is at the request of patrol officers.,189,,
1066,0.97,9749.806,9753.41,They respond to the crime survivors following the traumatic event.,189,,
1067,0.97,9753.41,9769.793,"The Vst was designed to address the gap in services on the weekend when domestic violence calls are happening the most frequently and also, community services are hardest to access during that time, as well.",189,,
1068,0.97,9769.793,9786.176,"They provide transportation, help locate emergency shelters and provide emergency services such as food, baby needs and clothing and they do extensive community resource for Vearl, providing the bridge for services.",189,,
1069,0.97,9786.176,9796.052,"They spend quite a bit of time answering questions and helping to navigate the criminal justice system and offer extensive safety planning, as well.",189,,
1070,0.97,9796.052,9807.864,"We have a staff advocate during the week who provides case management to address the survivor's basic needs and as well, coordination across multiple systems.",189,,
1071,0.97,9807.864,9809.199,Next slide.,189,,
1072,0.97,9809.199,9827.25,Our second program are the crime victim advocates and we have nine staff who have come over from SPD and they are responsible for ensuring that the Washington state statutory obligations are met with timely Notifications to crime victims and upholding the crime victims bill of rights.,189,,
1073,0.97,9827.25,9841.731,"All of the advocates are responsible for providing the required services to crime survivors, ensuring the statutory applications are met, as I said.",189,,
1074,0.97,9841.731,9855.078,"They accompany victims to defense interviews and court hearings and speak on behalf of the victims when asked to do so, often reading the victim impact statement on behalf of that victim while in court.",189,,
1075,0.97,9855.078,9866.456,"They provide ongoing safety planning for survivors of coercive control throughout the process and as most of you know, it's quite extensive, especially this past year with the courts being closed.",189,,
1076,0.97,9866.456,9896.887,"They also assist with mitigating the impact of the crime, such as helping to file the crime victims compensation forms and claims and assisting with bereavement arrangements with family members of Homicide victims and the advocate on behalf of the survivors for the workplace and tenant rights and assisting with securing alternate care for providers of elder abuse survivors and as well, connecting survivors with restorative healing services and/or counseling.",189,,
1077,0.97,9896.887,9897.32,That is it for me.,189,,
1078,0.97,9897.32,9898.655,Any questions?,189,,
1079,0.97,9898.655,9898.888,Yes.,190,,
1080,0.97,9898.888,9908.498,I have a question about the volunteer program.,191,,
1081,0.97,9908.498,9943.033,"For the volunteers, has there been an assessment of whether or not that number of volunteers has the capacity to meet the need? the numbers of people, and the assessment of whether or not the Cohort of volunteers, given its demographic makeup, is capable of delivering culturally relevant survivor services?",191,,
1082,0.97,9943.033,9985.976,"I'm concerned about relying on a volunteer Cohort . In instances where the city wants a different representation, typically, this is for community engagement processes, not working to volunteer in this fashion, but we provided Stipends out of recognition that you get a different population of people to participate because not everybody that you want to participate can afford to volunteer.",191,,
1083,0.97,9985.976,9987.677,I'm wondering if that sort of analysis has been done with this volunteer Cohort.,191,,
1084,0.97,9987.677,10010.834,"I want to make sure--Obviously, I value everybody's service, public service as a volunteer but I also want to make sure that the demographic compensation is able to deliver culturally relevant services.",191,,
1085,0.97,10010.834,10011.868,Sure.,192,,
1086,0.97,10011.868,10012.168,Thank you.,192,,
1087,0.97,10012.168,10013.37,You asked a couple of questions and I want to answer them.,192,,
1088,0.97,10013.37,10024.581,The first one was whether we are really meeting the needs during that window of time.,192,,
1089,0.97,10024.581,10036.459,"I will say that our efforts, as I stated earlier, are trying to bridge the gap in services and that can't be done with just our program.",192,,
1090,0.97,10036.459,10037.527,It really can't.,192,,
1091,0.97,10037.527,10051.741,We are Partnering with community programs that serve specific populations and we are trying to connect them to services that are more sustainable with that emergency response.,192,,
1092,0.97,10051.741,10054.077,"By nature, it is at the discretion of the patrol officers to utilize our services.",192,,
1093,0.97,10054.077,10057.08,"The quick answer is, no.",192,,
1094,0.97,10057.08,10070.56,We probably are not meeting the needs of everyone who could utilize those services on the weekend.,192,,
1095,0.97,10070.56,10085.275,We are always trying to increase our utilization by going to roll call Trainings to promote the use of the program with patrol officers with that discretion.,192,,
1096,0.97,10085.275,10109.566,"We are working to increase that and over the last year, the volunteers have been furloughed because of restrictions, health restrictions and we haven't been able to get the volunteers in the field and there have been huge gaps in services as we figure out how to bring them back quickly to be more responsive.",192,,
1097,0.97,10109.566,10148.538,"To make sure we are representational in the communities we serve, that is always something we are working toward and I can recognize that we are not currently representational as a volunteer Corps of about 60 volunteers but that is a priority of ours and we are trying to ensure that we are working with the different community groups we are referring to and as well, the communities we are serving to identify how we can provide additional diversity and representation on our volunteer team.",192,,
1098,0.97,10148.538,10156.646,"That said, we are just one point in a much broader network of service providers.",192,,
1099,0.97,10156.646,10164.721,They can't do it all.,192,,
1100,0.97,10164.721,10169.993,"It's really, really important that we continue to collaborate and partner with those community programs.",192,,
1101,0.97,10169.993,10174.33,I do support those community programs receiving funding.,192,,
1102,0.97,10174.33,10182.739,You bring up an interesting point and we will take it back to our Department.,193,,
1103,0.97,10182.739,10188.444,"With the transfer of this unit into Hsd, and you know Hsd RAISES social justice initiatives.",193,,
1104,0.97,10188.444,10202.725,"It is very much at the forefront of the work we are doing and with the staff, we have direct services throughout the whole Department, as well.",193,,
1105,0.97,10202.725,10206.262,"Process improvement, especially, making sure we are lifting our representation.",193,,
1106,0.97,10206.262,10209.966,It's really important to us and we will definitely take your feedback into our work.,193,,
1107,0.97,10209.966,10212.302,Thank you.,194,,
1108,0.97,10212.302,10234.824,"One other question . your answer to my first question, how do we, if we wanted to, how do we analyze SPD's voluntary use of the victim advocates?",194,,
1109,0.97,10234.824,10256.245,"If there is a feeling that, perhaps, they are not being deployed as often as they can be and that is anecdotal, is there data that we could seek to either confirm or dispute that?",194,,
1110,0.97,10256.245,10264.087,I see utilization of our program is something I have Woked on for many years.,195,,
1111,0.97,10264.087,10282.272,"I will say that where we are possibly seeing a reduction in use of calling us out on the scene, we are trying to close gaps in other ways.",195,,
1112,0.97,10282.272,10304.661,"The benefit of having this partnership and access to Seattle police Department and their records is that we can do a deeper dive on calls that we are not getting called to on scene and for instance, cases where we see that they won't get assigned a detective or won't get aside a system based advocate.",195,,
1113,0.97,10304.661,10314.003,"We will try to fill that gap later on, maybe even the next day, by reaching out to the survivor of that crime and providing those services, otherwise.",195,,
1114,0.97,10314.003,10328.184,We are really trying to get more creative about how we can reach out to folks who need our services that are not being called out to the scene with the volunteers on the weekend and that is where our staff advocate really comes in.,195,,
1115,0.97,10328.184,10329.052,Thank you.,196,,
1116,0.97,10329.052,10352.041,"So, we could request information from Hsd about the number of times that you went out, with the officer and times you didn't go out but followed up the next day?",196,,
1117,0.97,10352.041,10353.409,That is a report we could fill?,196,,
1118,0.97,10353.409,10354.243,"I do keep that information, yes.",197,,
1119,0.97,10354.243,10357.914,Thank you.,198,,
1120,0.97,10357.914,10374.664,I'm not seeing any other questions or hands.,199,,
1121,0.97,10374.664,10378.101,Is that the conclusion of the report?,199,,
1122,0.97,10378.101,10378.768,It is.,200,,
1123,0.97,10378.768,10380.837,Great.,201,,
1124,0.97,10380.837,10386.843,"One other question, Tanya, we had talked about the fact that you are working on finalizing an Mou with the Seattle police.",201,,
1125,0.97,10386.843,10404.093,"Just so folks understand the complexity associated with this transfer, can you talk a little bit about the areas that this Mou is going to cover?",201,,
1126,0.97,10404.093,10406.829,Dana can speak to that.,202,,
1127,0.97,10406.829,10419.776,"With this transition, the interdepartmental agreement was created and it defines the coordination and outlines matters related to business requirements and specific job duties of each employee.",203,,
1128,0.97,10419.776,10435.124,It establishes a plan for ongoing case assignments for the staff and the use of equipment and continued access to secure law enforcement facilities and secure databases and police records.,203,,
1129,0.97,10435.124,10437.226,"So, this is currently now being rounded up for signatures?",204,,
1130,0.97,10437.226,10437.46,Great.,204,,
1131,0.97,10437.46,10438.828,All right.,204,,
1132,0.97,10438.828,10441.33,Great news.,204,,
1133,0.97,10441.33,10446.536,I have been checking on the status of that a little bit here and there and last time I did not know that you were at this stage.,205,,
1134,0.97,10446.536,10458.014,Good news to receive in a committee briefing and so thank you.,205,,
1135,0.97,10458.014,10466.656,I'm not hearing or seeing any other questions or comments.,205,,
1136,0.97,10466.656,10482.605,"No raised hands and I know actual raised hands, so I appreciate your flexibility with our agenda and I appreciate the work you are doing and I see that Councilmember Gonzalez is coming on the screen to say hello and goodbye, or do you have a question?",205,,
1137,0.97,10482.605,10494.984,I also wanted to express my deep appreciation and gratitude to the team for a good presentation.,206,,
1138,0.97,10494.984,10500.356,I was taking lots of notes and I really appreciate the hard work.,206,,
1139,0.97,10500.356,10504.527,This is a difficult space to work with Ian and I really appreciate the tenacity and the thoroughness of the team.,206,,
1140,0.97,10504.527,10505.695,Thank you all for that work.,206,,
1141,0.97,10505.695,10515.004,All right.,207,,
1142,0.97,10515.004,10526.282,"Thank you for your time, your work and flexibility with this today.",207,,
1143,0.97,10526.282,10533.389,"The next public safety Committee is may 11th and before we adjourn, is there any comments from my colleagues or closing remarks?",207,,
1144,0.97,10533.389,10534.023,This is the time to make them.,207,,
1145,0.97,10534.023,10534.59,"If not, we are adjourned.",207,,
