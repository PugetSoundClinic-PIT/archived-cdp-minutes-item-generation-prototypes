17,0.97,106.272,115.081,I had a chance to participate in a press conference with her and members of two Seattle clubs and Seattle housing authority.,5,,

19,0.97,136.302,155.421,I want to thank Senator Murray for her leadership and our Seattle delegation for the work that they have done in Congress to pass a few pieces of legislation early in the Covid crisis and the emergency relief fun and the air and rescue plan act quicker dollars here locally.,5,,
20,0.97,155.421,170.837,We want to make sure that every dollar allocated to the city and appropriated by the counsel and signed into law by the Mayor is getting out the door swiftly.,5,,
21,0.97,170.837,177.277,Thank you to Senator Murray for up 16 0-Dollars and the emergency relief fund they passed in progress.,5,,

24,0.97,191.157,201.301,So I want to say a quick moment of thank you and appreciation to Senator Murray for the work that she and our congressional partners are doing to pass that act.,5,,
25,0.97,201.301,240.273,I also in the same token following up from our conversation this morning see a deep sense of urgency to get clarification on the allocation that we had expected to go out the door in the summer of this year with the passage of the American rescue act dollars through our local relief package known as the Seattle rescue plan to see millions of dollars sitting and not yet allocated and not encumbered makes me get those dollars out the door and for our spending for next year.,5,,
26,0.97,240.273,244.877,I know central staff mentioned that they would be looking through the list.,5,,
27,0.97,244.877,263.663,We have strong Federal partners fighting for funding specific to cities like Seattle that have been at the forefront of experiencing population growth and rising income inequality and housing Affordability and this is part of the solution that our congressional members have been making available for us.,5,,
28,0.97,263.663,282.181,Let's act with good partnership and speed to get those dollars out the door and more information coming soon on ensuring a follow through and implementation on those Seattle dollars.,5,,
29,0.97,282.181,287.387,Madam clerk can you read into the record I Fem 3.,5,,
30,0.97,287.387,291.124,Agenda item three homelessness response.,6,,
31,0.97,291.124,291.724,For briefing and discussion.,6,,
32,0.97,291.724,293.76,Thank you very much.,7,,
33,0.97,293.76,332.031,"Appreciate the opportunity to walk through this presentation with you, Jeff and we will go to Councilmember Lewis as you walk through your initial slide and speaking of income Inequal and the growth and income Inequal in our city just coming into City hall, I saw an individual that was washing their clothes in our fountain and that is a call for urgency and a place for people to be safe and secured and it was a reminder today of how much yet we have to do to address that income and inequality and deploy the resources.",7,,
34,0.97,332.031,344.977,Looking to this presentation and I saw you Councilmember Lewis getting clarity and direction how the moving parts as we consider our proposed budget.,7,,
35,0.97,344.977,346.913,"Jeff, let's take it away.",7,,
36,0.97,346.913,347.714,Thank you.,8,,
37,0.97,347.714,368.234,Jeff Simms counsel central staff and I don't see them on screen but I will be joined by Traci Ratcliffe and Brian good knight.,8,,
38,0.97,368.234,378.077,I will talk about changes and the increases are primarily in utilities and the housing Department.,8,,
39,0.97,378.077,392.825,And all of those are essentially unchanged you can navigate this table there's a line noting the clean city initiative and Spu parks and s DOT and those amounts do not add into the totals.,8,,
40,0.97,392.825,395.428,If there is any confusion I hope that clarifies it.,8,,
41,0.97,395.428,411.811,We want to make sure we were reflecting the clear overlap of homelessness and those are not always necessarily programs that are targeted on homelessness.,8,,
42,0.97,411.811,412.345,Brian will address that.,8,,
43,0.97,412.345,413.312,The human services Department.,8,,
44,0.97,413.312,422.688,There is a change and I know that executive touched on that when they presented the homelessness responses Department.,8,,
45,0.97,422.688,427.527,"If you look at this, it looks like a $34 million change.",8,,
46,0.97,427.527,438.437,And in fact 25 million of that is actually just transfers so that is a substantial part of the reduction you see right away.,8,,
47,0.97,438.437,439.705,Primarily a pass through to the city to manage the programs.,8,,
48,0.97,439.705,471.204,We don't have to do that pass through because we have regional authority to receive it and the transfer of the lead program to a different division so it is not counted in homelessness services where it was always kind of an awkward positioning any way and you will remember that last year's budget has had funding especially emergency grant Covid funding which was 26 millions and other funds related to emergency services.,8,,
49,0.97,471.204,487.186,That is why you see a big decrease and I realize that in preparing for this presentation that I probably should have put this into a table and and there is a variety of increases shared with you and have been touched on in other presentations.,8,,
50,0.97,487.186,500.733,But given and I know it has been brought up I want to make sure I highlight the funding sources for the various increases in the human services Department related to homelessness.,8,,
51,0.97,500.733,507.673,There's three that are all coming from Clipper dollars that will be appropriated with this package of the budget legislation.,8,,
52,0.97,507.673,534.867,"So money for three years of operations and the cares shelter and money for two years of operations in some capital costs for the Salvation Army shelter and $3.7 million to continue the modification in our various homelessness programs and shelters due to Covid-19 and last year we added one time funding and again this year, ultimately some of these costs may become part of base operations.",8,,
53,0.97,534.867,542.975,We will continue to maintain them and treating them as emergency adjustments at this time.,8,,
54,0.97,542.975,547.78,I wanted to highlight these funding sources called jump start.,8,,
55,0.97,547.78,557.69,"First is $6 million for services that and this is as I mentioned earlier and I believe yesterday during Committee, services for emergency--sorry.",8,,
56,0.97,557.69,563.362,Emergency housing that is provided to the Seattle and King County housing authority.,8,,
57,0.97,563.362,574.006,$2.4 million to operate the tiny home Vil Lambeau fields that we will be able to set up or start up using $2 million provided with state Capitol funds.,8,,
58,0.97,574.006,598.097,"Chairman Mosqueda asked about this earlier and wanted to make sure that was apparent and $811,000 for add administrative costs at the regional authority staffing and overhead and then Lastly $100,000 on and this is to provide ongoing funding for the lease facility transitional housing program that utilizing Seattle authority units.",8,,
59,0.97,598.097,605.705,They are what is going on in the human services Department and it looks like it is a large drop.,8,,
60,0.97,605.705,616.549,A drop of $9 million when you take out all of the one time money you put in that smaller one time funds and we are not seeing dramatic ongoing changes.,8,,
61,0.97,616.549,627.126,And I think that Brian will go into Spu and I know TR ACI will go into other areas as well.,8,,
62,0.97,627.126,633.799,We will go to the next slide.,8,,
63,0.97,633.799,645.444,You have seen previously if you were part of the homelessness or sorry if you remember the homelessness presentation and the select homelessness presentation.,8,,
64,0.97,645.444,651.117,As requested by counsel I have added two more columns and it shows the projected city funded shelter capacity will be.,8,,
65,0.97,651.117,668.634,"You can see that we will continue to have one time funding, a lot of which comes off line and in January and replaced by other funds and shelters are off line by the time we get to this summer.",8,,
66,0.97,668.634,670.669,Overall the shelter capacity would have increased.,8,,
67,0.97,670.669,684.917,I can see there is base units and a large number of tiny villages shown in a gray collar that will take our capacity possess where it was Prepandemic.,8,,
68,0.97,684.917,696.729,"Madam chair, do you want me to be Pausing for comments and questions or should I keep moving?",8,,
69,0.97,696.729,699.098,This is our--our only item this afternoon.,9,,
70,0.97,699.098,707.44,I will ask that you get through the next two slides.,9,,
71,0.97,707.44,714.747,We will Getgo get to the next slide then.,10,,
72,0.97,714.747,735.167,"As you are aware, I discussed a potential or there was a point in time proposal from the King County homelessness authority for taking an approach to addressing downtown and shelter homelessness and presented at the time in early September and actually key aspects would have to change.",10,,
73,0.97,735.167,751.25,"In order for it to somehow be put together in a current base strategy as various commitments for some of these resources have been named so utilizing for example, some of the vacant shelters that we would have are now being Prioritized for other purposes or other locations I should say.",10,,
74,0.97,751.25,759.759,Things like that and so there is a lot of moving pieces that have outdated this to some degree but I felt it was important to highlight this for a few different reasons.,10,,
75,0.97,759.759,775.541,First of all because it is becoming an important conversation piece and part of the public dialogue since the authority is discussing taking a place base approach and focusing on downtown initially as a first step.,10,,
76,0.97,775.541,783.549,Also because of the utilization of some of the items that I'm going to note later and issue in Id and accomplishing this strategy.,10,,
77,0.97,783.549,799.265,And I think it is important that we have the overall picture so that when we talk about the high Acuity shelter and pure navigator network you will have a clear understanding how this will fit into the initial proposals from the authority.,10,,
78,0.97,799.265,812.778,I will run through what all five lines are and I will move to Brian to discuss Seattle public utilities background.,10,,
79,0.97,812.778,828.027,There is an existing shelter program and we have turnover and shelters do a good job of moving people to another stage of housing and reunite families and things like that.,10,,
80,0.97,828.027,840.506,Vacancies occur utilizing at that point the anticipated turnover and Prioritizing that is 120 units and one of the most key areas that this plan is outdated and would have to be revised.,10,,
81,0.97,840.506,846.212,"The next line, you can see is funding from King County and resources.",10,,
82,0.97,846.212,854.486,Úand we look here and this is King County Covid appropriations 7 I believe it was.,10,,
83,0.97,854.486,862.261,Passed over the summer and specifically allocated funds and moving people inside and it identified a priority for downtown and for Unincorporated King County.,10,,
84,0.97,862.261,878.744,In those five hundred units you will see the idea that 275 would be utilized and consistent with what was stated as priority to move people from the downtown area into shelters of some kind or other resources.,10,,
85,0.97,878.744,881.213,"And then the next line, the new shelter.",10,,
86,0.97,881.213,882.381,I will go into that a lot.,10,,
87,0.97,882.381,889.288,That's a request of all of you for additional funding from the King County regional homelessness authority.,10,,
88,0.97,889.288,891.156,And I won't go into that at this time.,10,,
89,0.97,891.156,896.228,Next line looking at emergency housing.,10,,
90,0.97,896.228,916.048,"This is the sales tax or what and the--to this point, the county has acquired nine different buildings and 859 units approximately and in total that have been required and these are going to be used for permanent and supported housing and emergency housing.",10,,
91,0.97,916.048,926.592,Those are synonymous in terms of the services that are provided to people that are occupying those units and housing.,10,,
92,0.97,926.592,939.605,And newly different emergency housing does not have its own kitchen and it is a challenge unit and something along those lines.,10,,
93,0.97,939.605,958.857,"Of the 9 buildings, four of those unit is in Seattle and this proposal will have an initiative 290 of those 400 are identified for--for addressing the long term placement of people that are already in shelters that intensified.",10,,
94,0.97,958.857,963.529,If you think of the main shelter on 3RD and James.,10,,
95,0.97,963.529,970.636,And how those residents move during Covid to the Red line Inn and that location is not going to stay in operation.,10,,
96,0.97,970.636,982.448,And so some of these units that are going on with housing will shall used to provide permanent housing for those individuals and those other programs with the same experience.,10,,
97,0.97,982.448,987.953,"And overall, looking at the 400 unit is in Seattle and 110 left.",10,,
98,0.97,987.953,994.259,And targeted towards this type of approach and if that was the revised plan to get developed.,10,,
99,0.97,994.259,1004.97,And that means 200 beds would be needed from the investments and the acquisitions outside of Seattle.,10,,
100,0.97,1004.97,1011.543,That one key consideration is not everyone experiencing homelessness is from Seattle.,10,,
101,0.97,1011.543,1014.546,That was their last place of residence.,10,,
102,0.97,1014.546,1019.785,You might allow them to return to communities where they came from and have stronger social bonds in a long-term way.,10,,
103,0.97,1019.785,1028.193,And then the 5th and final line in that plan is permanent housing.,10,,
104,0.97,1028.193,1048.414,This is using investments and at this time the latest numbers that Tracy was able to obtain is 291 units will be opened this year and so we will be using a small portion of those to--as part of the strategy if this was a component of whatever became a final plan.,10,,
105,0.97,1048.414,1053.719,This was just a vision initially presented and already had to be outdated and will have to have changes.,10,,
106,0.97,1053.719,1066.965,So with that I will turn it over to Brian to run to the next background slide.,10,,
107,0.97,1066.965,1067.966,Brian good knight.,11,,
108,0.97,1067.966,1069.802,Counsel central staff.,11,,
109,0.97,1069.802,1080.212,"Page 5 shows the programs with Spu that are related to homelessness, hygiene and clean city initiative and the remaining clean-up programs that Spu has that are known as clean city programs.",11,,
110,0.97,1080.212,1093.058,As can be seen in the table overall the 2022 proposed budget increases investments sin the entire suite of programs by 2-Point #million and 12.,11,,
111,0.97,1093.058,1103.268,Relative to 2021 adopted budget and staffing dedicated to the programs will increase by three FTE that plays the staffing next year to almost 23Fte.,11,,
112,0.97,1103.268,1119.952,The table also carvings out space for two Subtotal rows and those are the ones shaded in this light gray color with I Tal Licks to provide groupings for programs that are homelessness related and for programs that are proposed to receive additional funding related to clean city initiative.,11,,
113,0.97,1119.952,1125.29,And that fund will be discussed in more detail in the issue identification of the presentation.,11,,
114,0.97,1125.29,1142.574,There is another caveat that I want to note for the table and due to the imprecise way that Spu allocates labor it appears that a couple of the programs the encampment tremor program is Deceasing but that is not the case.,11,,
115,0.97,1142.574,1148.046,Labor is not indicated in as fine of detail as this table presents.,11,,
116,0.97,1148.046,1155.387,Staff time is increasing overall with addition of new progresses and maybe attributed to Inwreck clean city programs.,11,,
117,0.97,1155.387,1160.092,Sp has confirmed that the 2022 proposed budget that does not decrease services for any of these programs.,11,,
118,0.97,1160.092,1168.634,In terms of notable changes there are three that I'd like to briefly mention that relate to recreational vehicles.,11,,
119,0.97,1168.634,1173.906,"The first is additional $275,000 of ongoing funding for three additional public hygiene stations.",11,,
120,0.97,1173.906,1178.944,Increasing the total number of funded stations from 18 to 21.,11,,
121,0.97,1178.944,1188.687,Spu stated their intention these new hygiene stations services will be provided near Rven Camments.,11,,
122,0.97,1188.687,1193.058,"The second item is proposed 560,000Ed for the remediation program.",11,,
123,0.97,1193.058,1202.1,In 2022Spu will return the program back to its original framework and provides 6 to 8 full clean screens a month.,11,,
124,0.97,1202.1,1212.878,This is in contrast to how the program has been operating during the encampment and pandemic.,11,,
125,0.97,1212.878,1214.98,This will support three efforts.,11,,
126,0.97,1214.98,1231.697,A new field coordinator position proposed in the supplemental budget and the field Corator will provide site evaluations and connect individuals residing in Rvs to resources and facilitate trash resources and manage the storage of belongings if necessary.,11,,
127,0.97,1231.697,1247.479,The second effort is the distribution of purple beds to 7 to 10Rv bags and third what the Department is calling Geo screens and trash pickup in different areas of the city.,11,,
128,0.97,1247.479,1249.348,Spu estimates about 16 Geo cleans will happen each hospital.,11,,
129,0.97,1249.348,1259.358,"And the third notable increase that I will mention for the budget is $175,000 for the Rv waste water program.",11,,
130,0.97,1259.358,1264.296,"According to data provided by Spu, between Jan and September the program serviced 133Rvs per month.",11,,
131,0.97,1264.296,1268.4,During these six months the program was operating on a four week interval.,11,,
132,0.97,1268.4,1278.21,During six of these minutes the program was operating on four week service interval and then six week interval.,11,,
133,0.97,1278.21,1287.352,Spu says the funding request are to address higher than anticipated servicing costs including waste water volumes being greater than expected.,11,,
134,0.97,1287.352,1296.561,Spu says that the program will be able to service for 120Rvs per month on a four week servicing interval.,11,,
135,0.97,1296.561,1309.107,And that concludes my remarks for this slide and this is the last slide of the background section and we can pause for questions.,11,,
136,0.97,1309.107,1309.441,Wonderful.,12,,
137,0.97,1309.441,1315.113,I will hand it to Councilmember Lewis to see if you have comments or questions.,12,,
138,0.97,1315.113,1343.342,Thank you so much Madam chair and I appreciate we have a whole afternoon to dive just into this given that without a doubt in my office and I would imagine for many of your fellow Councilmembers that homelessness in the city's homelessness response is a pretty common constituent inquiry.,13,,
139,0.97,1343.342,1355.153,"So appreciate the carve out of time to dive deep into this and Madam chair before I go further this is to ask questions to Brian and to the entire pitch here, right?",13,,
140,0.97,1355.153,1355.587,That's right.,14,,
141,0.97,1355.587,1368.567,And then we can go into the issues that they have identified in the next seven or eight slides and the macro memo or things you would like to pull out for our reference.,14,,
142,0.97,1368.567,1368.9,Perfect.,15,,
143,0.97,1368.9,1369.367,Thank you very much.,15,,
144,0.97,1369.367,1392.157,Just to make general comments the talk earlier this week is folks are aware my office released a report of some of the data and trends regarding homelessness in the city of Seattle during the Covid emergency.,15,,
145,0.97,1392.157,1397.729,Broadly and mostly speaking for myself and how I took things away from the data.,15,,
146,0.97,1397.729,1421.486,It indicated that Covid came along and forced us to reduce the quantity of shelter and improve the quality and the result of that was a dramatic increase of people camping in public spaces that under ordinary circumstances would have had a place in a Congregant or semi Congregant shelter in Precovid times.,15,,
147,0.97,1421.486,1436.168,As you have seen from the presentation and as you have seen from my comments we are about to have a large amount of resources that will come Online to help equalize that disparity.,15,,
148,0.97,1436.168,1497.762,"We know before Covid, homelessness was a huge crisis in the city of Seattle requiring much more immediate and sustained response on a systemic level and what I really--as we go through this budget process this fall I want to focus on not only shelter capacity that I think is still very important to provide that short-term relief for some people that don't have any other option like at this moment and need someplace to go and to focus on strategies at the new regional homeless authority and a pass through from the shelter assets for housing and then work on the Scaling up and Resourcing are those housing assets that we have seen considerable resource for over the course of the Covid era due to unprecedented Federal sport or acquisition of housing.",15,,
149,0.97,1497.762,1531.396,With that we also need to lean into a policy discussion about what will happen with the outreach function that historically has been conducted by the navigation team and the hope team in the future will be conducted by some other outreach concept that regional authority will put forward and we know there are assets as have been forward here and we have discussed with the relevant Department two weeks ago or the relevant leadership in the Mayor's office two weeks ago.,15,,
150,0.97,1531.396,1564.963,There are resources that envision some kind of city role in that process of doing or providing services and providing outreach to Encampments to stay in the city family and really making sure that we have a policy discussion about what the edge of the city involvement is and what constitutes outreach and what constitutes some kind of supplemental service that is not related to that initial outreach mission.,15,,
151,0.97,1564.963,1576.474,"That is at the high level for this early conversation and I think for questions to start with Jeff, I want to ask questions about the chart, Jeff, the shelter one.",15,,
152,0.97,1576.474,1599.564,I don't remember which slide that was on but the slide that we have seen several variations of over the last several months detailing the supply of shelter houses with the Covid emergency.,15,,
153,0.97,1599.564,1603.335,That is slide three there you go.,16,,
154,0.97,1603.335,1603.602,Great.,17,,
155,0.97,1603.602,1607.872,A few questions with this chart.,18,,
156,0.97,1607.872,1621.152,This chart at this point in vision the result of the Rfq that is anticipated to be done for the authority for 120 more tiny houses and 25 safe house spaces?,18,,
157,0.97,1621.152,1621.453,It does.,19,,
158,0.97,1621.453,1622.12,Okay.,20,,
159,0.97,1622.12,1635.533,But it doesn't anticipate to be conservative on projections that would be reflected in the final column for July of 2022 where there is 325 units.,21,,
160,0.97,1635.533,1641.973,That is a Council funded expansion and the Council had given money to open those.,21,,
161,0.97,1641.973,1654.452,Not to in that presentation I am not trying to indicate that units are opened until July but I think there is still an open question on how long it will take for those to occur.,21,,
162,0.97,1654.452,1666.698,At this point I feel like we could say with confidence there is no operations in 2021 but unclear how early in 2022 those units will be Online so they were not Online in March.,21,,
163,0.97,1666.698,1672.07,Hopefully that is something that can happen much faster.,21,,
164,0.97,1672.07,1674.339,Thank you.,22,,
165,0.97,1674.339,1692.557,I wanted to see if that asset incorporated into this chart and it is fair to put it in given the understanding that there will be an Rfq and an effort to get them going and hopefully we can lapped that more in that March of 2022.,22,,
166,0.97,1692.557,1705.837,For landing the budgeting good to know it is anticipated in here and I guess to a certain extent I was hoping that maybe it wouldn't be so that column might go up a little bit more.,22,,
167,0.97,1705.837,1708.339,But that is answering my question.,22,,
168,0.97,1708.339,1725.99,So in the budget that came down from the executive because there is lots of proposals that we have discussed to increase the amount of shelter resources in 2022.,22,,
169,0.97,1725.99,1734.866,Does the transmitted budget request from the Mayor and regional housing authority have more capacity or does it sustain the capacity from 2021?,22,,
170,0.97,1734.866,1738.937,Let me go in detail about what is in there.,23,,
171,0.97,1738.937,1748.446,I'm not sure of how you look at the investments there.,23,,
172,0.97,1748.446,1750.782,So there is thorough dollars.,23,,
173,0.97,1750.782,1760.625,The second Trunch are Clipper dollars and that's for the cares shelter and provides three years of operations for the cares shelter and that is I believe it is 75.,23,,
174,0.97,1760.625,1783.948,I don't actually have that in front of me but I can double- check that and then there is the Soto shelter that is currently in operation on Cunty leased property and provides two years of operations there.,23,,
175,0.97,1783.948,1788.653,That is maintaining that program essentially and those are the only ones.,23,,
176,0.97,1788.653,1790.955,I am for getting something else.,23,,
177,0.97,1790.955,1793.758,The funds for the ongoing basis.,23,,
178,0.97,1793.758,1806.004,The three tiny home villages you referred to and those are the only things that I am able to recall that is emergency shelter proposals.,23,,
179,0.97,1806.004,1807.205,So Kara is not in operation.,23,,
180,0.97,1807.205,1819.551,This chart does project by December of 2021 that 110 of those units will be in operation and part of the blue base.,23,,
181,0.97,1819.551,1824.556,I can--I could go into detail about that if needed.,23,,
182,0.97,1824.556,1825.957,That program is expected to be 150 units.,23,,
183,0.97,1825.957,1830.695,So another 40 and that is what you see as a reflection by March of 2022.,23,,
184,0.97,1830.695,1835.3,That is some of what that number and all of that bar is higher.,23,,
185,0.97,1835.3,1835.6,Yeah.,24,,
186,0.97,1835.6,1850.915,That is related to my next question that is to what extent is this an exercise turning this chart into blue for the first half of 2022?,24,,
187,0.97,1850.915,1853.251,That is a good question.,25,,
188,0.97,1853.251,1860.225,Nothing that is shown on this chart as peg something in yellow.,25,,
189,0.97,1860.225,1865.797,There is another color or anywhere else in the bar.,25,,
190,0.97,1865.797,1884.048,"They are almost entirely hotels, sheltering that are various program operate and some go Online and some go Offline and they don't go to expansion and Noneenvisioned to be in operation of July of 2022.",25,,
191,0.97,1884.048,1887.952,So I don't have any more questions about this chart.,26,,
192,0.97,1887.952,1893.191,Can we go to the downtown plan chart?,26,,
193,0.97,1893.191,1897.061,"Sure, if you could move forward two slides please.",27,,
194,0.97,1897.061,1903.334,"There is just one slide please, there we go.",28,,
195,0.97,1903.334,1911.676,"So on this chart, Okay, there is--there aren't any, you know costs that are attributed to these line items here.",28,,
196,0.97,1911.676,1915.179,At least on the chart.,28,,
197,0.97,1915.179,1934.799,But am I correct read that all of this is basically paid for somehow either through the mares transmitted proposal or through other sources of regional partnership like King County sources except for the new high end Acutity shelter.,28,,
198,0.97,1934.799,1936.467,Is that an accurate read of this?,28,,
199,0.97,1936.467,1950.648,That would be and that's a reason that this should be looked upon as outdated and point in time proposal because there have been changes in how some of these resources are being committed.,29,,
200,0.97,1950.648,1964.729,We have been told and I give the example with our existing vacancy that now we are going to be looking at a different point in time the available unit to be available and a different location and different am and things along those lines.,29,,
201,0.97,1964.729,1965.029,Right.,30,,
202,0.97,1965.029,1977.241,So it is not necessarily and this is sort of mostly me asking the District member rather than the homelessness chair right now.,30,,
203,0.97,1977.241,1995.159,"Would the 933 units at this point, that's the number you are saying is not necessarily up-to-date because in some of these categories some of that capacity has been taken away by some other priorities, is that what you are indicating?",30,,
204,0.97,1995.159,1995.426,Yeah.,31,,
205,0.97,1995.426,2004.469,The work done by the regional authority so far estimates and they work with some existing service providers and the downtown area.,31,,
206,0.97,2004.469,2024.689,And they estimate that there is about 800 people experiencing unsheltered homelessness and that is the target of this approach and at that point in early September so six weeks ago had identified this as the number of beds that would be utilized to move those people in some way.,31,,
207,0.97,2024.689,2024.956,Okay.,32,,
208,0.97,2024.956,2031.195,Can we now go forward to more of the sort of parks and Spu assets?,32,,
209,0.97,2031.195,2041.973,There was another--I don't know what the right sort of power point background would be for that.,32,,
210,0.97,2041.973,2046.577,I guess this is good.,32,,
211,0.97,2046.577,2071.169,So I continue to have some questions about exactly how we are going to coordinator what the in Ter play interplay is going to be between the community work and Sharps collection and how that will interact and in the end Camment clean-up contract.,32,,
212,0.97,2071.169,2074.072,How that work will interact with the new authority.,32,,
213,0.97,2074.072,2092.457,My understanding is that there is not going to be a explicitly outreach component anymore to the work that goes to the authority and I understand what the pitch has been from the executive.,32,,
214,0.97,2092.457,2117.915,But I do wonder about what the interplay is going to be when outreach is done and a site has been flagged by the authority as everyone having solved for placed in the shelter housing and now we are in a place where people have left stuff to be removed and people can come in.,32,,
215,0.97,2117.915,2160.625,That's the way I hope everything would be conducted that everything is happening in this slide is either some kind of routine service for encampment site and there is a removal of service left behind after everybody is removed out of sight and interaction with the people that had been living there and the city crew to do it and there is a new way of doing this that we don't merge enforcement and outreach in one team as we sort of historically have done.,32,,
216,0.97,2160.625,2179.11,So I wonder if you could go into a bit of your understanding of how these assets interplay with that and what the vision is as we craft this budget of how this is going to work with the new authority since this is all staying with us and not going.,32,,
217,0.97,2179.11,2179.477,Absolutely.,33,,
218,0.97,2179.477,2196.093,I will start and then turn it to Traci to go into the addition of parks where the new additions are.,33,,
219,0.97,2196.093,2208.94,So first while you are correct the homelessness outreach services that we currently have with the ten agencies that those contracts will be moved to the regional authorities.,33,,
220,0.97,2208.94,2209.874,The regional authority will oversee those.,33,,
221,0.97,2209.874,2219.65,In addition will you see all of the shelter contracts that we have moved to the regional authority.,33,,
222,0.97,2219.65,2245.076,However still outreach and service connection features retained in the city because the hope team is maintained in the Mayor's proposed budget and Hsd and that agency member team has three individuals actually their duty or their job description as a navigator and Councilmember.,33,,
223,0.97,2245.076,2253.818,Are familiar with that and the individuals that do connection and to shelter resources.,33,,
224,0.97,2253.818,2264.228,Under the new hope team compared to how the navigation team works.,33,,
225,0.97,2264.228,2274.972,System navigation determined by the parks or s DOT and different departments and a notification of posting that removal is made.,33,,
226,0.97,2274.972,2292.69,The way that hope team coordinates in addition to having been coordinating among providers and thinking about where to deploy or where might need extra attention is to identify who is there.,33,,
227,0.97,2292.69,2295.092,And the individual going there.,33,,
228,0.97,2295.092,2299.697,It is not uncommon.,33,,
229,0.97,2299.697,2300.564,There are targeted focuses.,33,,
230,0.97,2300.564,2320.718,"You may have people that have involvement, one outreach provider that is going to them and people on native American may have a different provider and working with them and the work at that point and there's three system navigators and an outreach coordinator that helps with this too.",33,,
231,0.97,2320.718,2334.465,They identify who is there and what the needs of those individuals and what agencies working there to identify shelter vacancies and what they are looking for and their ongoing needs.,33,,
232,0.97,2334.465,2342.94,It is important to note that of our shelters there is a carve out for a certain number of beds that can be accessed through the team.,33,,
233,0.97,2342.94,2356.32,And my understanding is that part of the negotiation of the master service agreement with the regional authority and an agreement that is not final at this point.,33,,
234,0.97,2356.32,2389.587,But it is part of the conversation that carve out of the units will continue and the team doing its work and in an encampment identified for removal in working with the information gained from our contracted providers will be able to facilitate service connections and individuals in that encampment will go to priorities for those carved out beds and then they can help with any other kind of service connections that are needed at that point.,33,,
235,0.97,2389.587,2399.33,And Ideally every individual in that encampment will receive a shelter based off of the needs previously identified.,33,,
236,0.97,2399.33,2406.203,Realistically we won't have the perfect match in a shelter bed because there is variations in what types of beds are available.,33,,
237,0.97,2406.203,2408.973,There is a bed available.,33,,
238,0.97,2408.973,2421.719,That's the city policy in what we call the multi disciplinary administrative role and that is an offer of shelter and it may not be perfectly suited.,33,,
239,0.97,2421.719,2428.192,I don't know all of the factors but something that Acidyl for that individual is possible to be offered.,33,,
240,0.97,2428.192,2429.894,So I hope that is helpful.,33,,
241,0.97,2429.894,2433.497,And that is work that the hope team has taken on.,33,,
242,0.97,2433.497,2480.778,"And talking with the team they made it clear that once a location and encampment is posted for removal our contracted providers have requested not to be there and it undermines their broader work and remembering that these providers are working across the city and pulling from their other work for example, if the Gcl are--sorry, working with our--especially focused on our native Americans experiencing homelessness and working with locations throughout the city if they have someone to make sure they are coming to work with and they have to pull away from somewhere else.",33,,
243,0.97,2480.778,2509.974,"So overall there is work that is going on to get people connected and to make sure that by the date that removal occurs that individuals are placed and for the most part between the removal date and posting date the hope team is taking the primary roll and system navigators are doing the connections and Tracy, do you want to pick up from there or do you want me to say anything more?",33,,
244,0.97,2509.974,2521.352,I will make sure that there aren't questions about that piece and I can talk about the special maintenance team.,34,,
245,0.97,2521.352,2524.588,I see Councilmember Morales.,35,,
246,0.97,2524.588,2526.523,Do you want to ask questions?,35,,
247,0.97,2526.523,2529.727,It is about public safety.,36,,
248,0.97,2529.727,2532.096,So I can wait.,36,,
249,0.97,2532.096,2541.005,Why don't we do the next item that Traci was going to respond to.,37,,
250,0.97,2541.005,2564.995,I want to ask real quick before we move on to Traci how much of the shelter going over the authority is going to be carved out to take the referral that are associated with removal posts.,38,,
251,0.97,2564.995,2570.634,I don't believe that number is determined for 2022.,39,,
252,0.97,2570.634,2580.21,It is something being discussed as part of the agreement between the city and regional authority on how the authority will operate programs.,39,,
253,0.97,2580.21,2583.781,And can go back and have the information or the last year.,39,,
254,0.97,2583.781,2588.652,I don't recall off of the top of my head.,39,,
255,0.97,2588.652,2593.057,I can get it to you.,39,,
256,0.97,2593.057,2594.058,Thank you.,40,,
257,0.97,2594.058,2606.37,"I have some questions but Councilmember Lewis, did you ask the question specific on the public utilities case that you can remind us of as we happened to it Tracy.",41,,
258,0.97,2606.37,2614.945,My question was mostly related to the interaction between outreach and enforcement.,42,,
259,0.97,2614.945,2617.314,So that was drilled down into the hygiene assets.,42,,
260,0.97,2617.314,2623.287,Great . Ppy to defer to you.,43,,
261,0.97,2623.287,2639.403,Let's take those questions and overview and Traci if you have anything else to add and we will go to Councilmember Morales and ask the set of questions before we go on.,43,,
262,0.97,2639.403,2699.196,Very briefly in 2018 we authorized the funding of the special maintenance team and parks and s DOT and this team which is about 15 member team from SPR and I'm not sure how many people I think it is mostly SPR on the staff are out doing not only Cleanings related to Enclosures and also Cleanings around Encampments and parks and city and state Right-Of-Ways and this team has been in existence since 2018 and we have credited through the last few years and what you will see in the proposed budget and we will talk about is the evolution and to take on the roles and responsibilities that used to be done by a navigation team and this today and does both that coordinates with closures and happening on the sanction encampment on parks and right of ways.,44,,
263,0.97,2699.196,2707.237,Some of the public health issues around that needle collection and things like that.,44,,
264,0.97,2707.237,2707.771,Great.,45,,
265,0.97,2707.771,2719.917,And I was reminded that these conversations regarding hope and referrals and cleaning and Spu's role relate to the first item identification.,46,,
266,0.97,2719.917,2736.266,So perhaps Councilmember Morales if your question is about any of the context in the earlier part of the memo I am happy to take those now and do a quick overview on identification one to get into more details.,46,,
267,0.97,2736.266,2743.574,I don't want to preempt your question but drill down to issue Id number one instead.,46,,
268,0.97,2743.574,2744.374,"Well, no.",47,,
269,0.97,2744.374,2755.519,What I am interested in whether the public project in 2022 is a carry over or additional funding and love to get a status update there.,47,,
270,0.97,2755.519,2755.753,Yes.,48,,
271,0.97,2755.753,2757.621,Councilmember Morales I can answer that question.,48,,
272,0.97,2757.621,2772.536,New money and the one hundred thousand dollar in 2021 was a grant released in two different entities and received the funding and Spu will work with those entities to carry forward that 2021 money fit is still outstanding that I believe there will be sister-in-law.,48,,
273,0.97,2772.536,2785.849,"There is an additional one hundred thousand dollars in 2022 and so this is in addition for $200,000 over the two years and Spu is planning to complete internal evaluation of the program and have it completed by the second quarter of next year.",48,,
274,0.97,2785.849,2798.562,"In terms of what will happen next with the money, it will be dependent upon what they come back with, with that evaluation but it is a new allocation of money.",48,,
275,0.97,2798.562,2798.996,Appreciate that.,49,,
276,0.97,2798.996,2801.064,If I could make one comment about the hope team.,49,,
277,0.97,2801.064,2818.382,"What I will say about this, I would love to see this program function the way it was spelled out in the SpA last year which was for the hope program and the folks part of that to serve in a support role for a provider led system that is not what they are doing now.",49,,
278,0.97,2818.382,2846.743,That is not the way it ended up getting implemented and I think that several couple member and service providers came top agreement about how this team would function within Hsd and not what we are seeing and I want to be clear what we intended and what happened are two different things.,49,,
279,0.97,2846.743,2847.277,Thank you.,50,,
280,0.97,2847.277,2847.678,Good reminder.,50,,
281,0.97,2847.678,2848.178,Councilmember Herbold.,50,,
282,0.97,2848.178,2852.316,Questions or comments on the first six pages of the memo?,50,,
283,0.97,2852.316,2852.549,Yes.,51,,
284,0.97,2852.549,2857.154,Thank you and this question was already asked and answered I apologized.,51,,
285,0.97,2857.154,2868.732,I had to step away for a second.,51,,
286,0.97,2868.732,2870.0,About the hygiene trailers.,51,,
287,0.97,2870.0,2871.068,Often these are mobile vehicles.,51,,
288,0.97,2871.068,2881.612,That even though they are mobile they are not designed to rotate among mum locations.,51,,
289,0.97,2881.612,2890.754,They go to a place and they plug into the water system and they pretty much stay in one location.,51,,
290,0.97,2890.754,2901.531,There are other types of hygiene trailers that are engineered and designed to be able to rotate on a schedule.,51,,
291,0.97,2901.531,2914.811,The reason why I ask is camp second chance has been operating for nearly six years.,51,,
292,0.97,2914.811,2935.699,Without reliable hygiene services and I don't need a hygiene trailer dedicated for camp second chance but I need to know that hygiene services are going there and so I really need to understand what SPD's idea is for this particular facility?,51,,
293,0.97,2935.699,2954.518,When we funded the hygiene trailers a few years ago as part of the everybody Poos campaign led by real change and Pearl jam and we had those wonderful--what we thought we were funding was a hygiene trailer that would be mobile and move around.,51,,
294,0.97,2954.518,2973.57,That is not what we ended up getting and I think there is some real utility of putting a vehicle like this on a schedule and being able to go to multiple places over the course of a week.,51,,
295,0.97,2973.57,2976.807,Thank you Councilmember Herbold.,52,,
296,0.97,2976.807,2977.24,I can respond back.,52,,
297,0.97,2977.24,2980.877,The two trailers that they purchased and acquired them this month.,52,,
298,0.97,2980.877,2990.02,"They are mobile trailers from my understanding, they ca be moved around to locations and they are Pearl capable and custom designed for Spu.",52,,
299,0.97,2990.02,3008.271,One of the trailers is operating at King Street station and they have told me they still intend for one to operate static Cally whether at King tree or somewhere else they have mentioned a location on Roy Street so their intention is to have one that operates effectively in static.,52,,
300,0.97,3008.271,3013.176,The other one has been operating seven days of the week at University heights.,52,,
301,0.97,3013.176,3019.716,"Their intention, they are operating additional sites right now so they hope to have one to two more sides that it will rotate with.",52,,
302,0.97,3019.716,3023.086,A total of three sites that second trailer would be moving around to.,52,,
303,0.97,3023.086,3032.195,They said that the evaluations are being done right now with the city's in Ter departmental team and that's the information I have right now.,52,,
304,0.97,3032.195,3052.349,So I wanted to propose a budget action that would ensure ensure that second chance camp would be one of the sites what would I do?,53,,
305,0.97,3052.349,3058.388,Talk to Spu about their plans and see if it is on the location list.,54,,
306,0.97,3058.388,3067.03,The council could provide funds and Spu's budget to ensure that it is delivering the services that Council wants to it deliver.,54,,
307,0.97,3067.03,3070.267,Thank you.,55,,
308,0.97,3070.267,3071.568,We will be following up appreciate it.,55,,
309,0.97,3071.568,3072.702,Thank you very much.,56,,
310,0.97,3072.702,3073.336,I appreciate it.,56,,
311,0.97,3073.336,3074.738,I am not seeing additional hands.,56,,
312,0.97,3074.738,3086.716,I will jump in with a few questions before we get to issue Id.,56,,
313,0.97,3086.716,3091.788,And I think it is important if we look at the information.,56,,
314,0.97,3091.788,3095.058,"Your bar chart shows, Jeff, thanks again for your memo.",56,,
315,0.97,3095.058,3100.33,We have much appreciation for the central staff and the detailed memos.,56,,
316,0.97,3100.33,3106.603,Chart one here is really the outcome of the information provided to the bottom of page 2 in the memo.,56,,
317,0.97,3106.603,3139.503,I think it is imperative that we call attention to the fact that redactions in bed over the time of the Scaling down of Covid and Covid induced reduction in beds available does not equal the same type of bed that is potentially being opened up and your memo calls it well by saying a we are not going to see the same level of permanent shelter capacity returning to what it was at Prepandemic levels.,56,,
318,0.97,3139.503,3148.311,It says that clearly but I think it is important to note they are not necessarily the same type of services offered to these beds.,56,,
319,0.97,3148.311,3152.816,If I am wrong please correct me.,56,,
320,0.97,3152.816,3170.033,"For example, we saw from Dsc over five hundred beds for high acute behavioral means and we saw the city scale them down to 98 beds and some offered around 150 offered in bed locations outside of the city in King County.",56,,
321,0.97,3170.033,3181.044,But we are not seeing the same number of high acute behavioral health and mental health beds opening up in the post pandemic world.,56,,
322,0.97,3181.044,3182.445,The numbers may be Scaling back.,56,,
323,0.97,3182.445,3182.746,Upwards.,56,,
324,0.97,3182.746,3194.925,They are not going to scale to Prepandemic levels and I think it is important to ask to get clarification that they are not the same type of services.,56,,
325,0.97,3194.925,3195.792,Are they?,56,,
326,0.97,3195.792,3201.364,You are correct Councilmember.,57,,
327,0.97,3201.364,3231.261,"They wouldn't exactly be the type of services that the example you gave was the shelters and focusing on people with mental health and so some of these programs for example, like the parts shown in gray are not equipped--they are tiny home villages and we have not funded those with a high level of service like in a navigation center.",57,,
328,0.97,3231.261,3231.728,Something like that.,57,,
329,0.97,3231.728,3245.475,"I do understand that with the three villages that are coming Online right now, so just because we keep talking in threes I will be clear about which ones.",57,,
330,0.97,3245.475,3268.164,"Friendship heights and the expansion of inner Bay village, with one and likely with police report than one Hsd is funding a higher level of services than what would have historically been the norm for a tiny home village so that there is a greater level of expertise to support those residents.",57,,
331,0.97,3268.164,3306.836,"Many of the system has and partly what you see when you look at the Covid, the intensification and modification funds that started part of that and overall the changes that Ultimated in some degrees to loss of beds are increasing the quality of our programs from a Congregant shelter to more Noncongregant approach and that doesn't mean one person in one room and a lot of times it may in tail the Dividers that are high or something along those lines in order to break the space up and give it more sense of privacy.",57,,
332,0.97,3306.836,3327.123,"We have moved towards in some ways as a system, a higher number of beds that are better quality because of those types of changes and the specific example you gave are we always adding a bed for high need individuals with that same level of services, probably not.",57,,
333,0.97,3327.123,3339.636,"That is where I think I am going to have a lot of questions as it relates to the model for the identification because a bed does not equal a bed, right?",58,,
334,0.97,3339.636,3349.379,"Especially for the beds that folks were offered that were low barrier, high service needs.",58,,
335,0.97,3349.379,3356.686,"Those types of services, I don't think we brought back to scale and that is what I will be looking for in the identification.",58,,
336,0.97,3356.686,3364.627,That has been an opportunity for us to move away from that on the floor shelter options so that folks line up at night and in the morning to leave.,58,,
337,0.97,3364.627,3392.956,We have been saying for a long time that model did not work and in some way to accelerate more Noncongregant shelters because of Covid and making sure that there is 24/7 options so that people aren't having to leave their positions or family members as they seek shelters will be important to look to as well.,58,,
338,0.97,3392.956,3396.659,Lots of questions to come.,58,,
339,0.97,3396.659,3402.832,"Another quick question here regarding the Rv remediation, I just want to get quick clarification.",58,,
340,0.97,3402.832,3426.389,I see Rv remediation and how we are helping to Reme Aeut waste or garbage in the area and Rv remediation to include any of the fund that we have allocated and asking the executive to implement for safe lots and the Rv storage.,58,,
341,0.97,3426.389,3442.705,"I see from the materials sent down from the budget office this morning that zero of the 500,000 allocated to present the safe Rvs and to see progress on that.",58,,
342,0.97,3442.705,3454.15,And I don't see on this the Rv storage from Councilmember Herbold.,58,,
343,0.97,3454.15,3456.853,Is that part of the remediation?,58,,
344,0.97,3456.853,3465.195,They are not expended at this time.,59,,
345,0.97,3465.195,3478.141,And at least currently obviously subject--I mentioned how the regional authority for the tiny home villages and getting that.,59,,
346,0.97,3478.141,3508.571,"The regional authority has agreed to take the $500,000 to provided in the Seattle rescue plan and begin issuing those funds and taking on some kind of services for people residing in Rvs and that is wholly different from the type of activities that Brian was describing as Rv remediation that is much more focused on the impacts.",59,,
347,0.97,3508.571,3515.512,I have focused more on waste water sources.,59,,
348,0.97,3515.512,3533.863,"Where as the Council, you have read this so focused on providing places for people in Rvs to park permanently and not move and see the discussion of providing storage and things like that.",59,,
349,0.97,3533.863,3534.23,Wonderful.,60,,
350,0.97,3534.23,3541.17,I thank you for the reminder about the Rv safe lot and the commitment of the homelessness authority.,60,,
351,0.97,3541.17,3544.908,I am not sure where that landed.,60,,
352,0.97,3544.908,3563.459,"The three tiny House villages using state's $2 million that Councilmember Lewis and the 400,000 that Council passed that is something that we talked about this morning and that there is an Rv or Rfp that will go out.",60,,
353,0.97,3563.459,3564.127,Councilmember Herbold.,60,,
354,0.97,3564.127,3606.302,"As it relates not to the Rv safe lots, but to the idea of a storage lot, for people who are no longer living in the Rv either because they have accepted housing but not ready to give up the Rv yet and want the security that is being held somewhere and there's also some question of Rvs that may be impounded under the resumption of the enforcement of the 72 hour rule although we know that we have been told, I should say we know.",61,,
355,0.97,3606.302,3627.991,We have been told by s DOT that did not intend to use it to impound the Rvs of people that are living in the Rvs unless those Rvs have a public health order associated with them and it is not clear with me how they define that.,61,,
356,0.97,3627.991,3645.241,In those cases that is another example where an Rv might be impounded and need to have a place to go instead of being taken to Lincoln town.,61,,
357,0.97,3645.241,3656.319,Going to a different--the potential purpose for storage lot.,61,,
358,0.97,3656.319,3681.911,And we--several of us received an Email from deputy director Colby yesterday where she writes in regards to question about the resumption of the 72 hour parking rule she writes contract staff will be looking with the University heights contractor to identify flexible funds to be used for property storage.,61,,
359,0.97,3681.911,3686.082,That is contracted by the Council budget and the storage will be time limited.,61,,
360,0.97,3686.082,3690.887,What are they referring to will they say property storage.,61,,
361,0.97,3690.887,3693.489,Are we talking about the same thing or is this different?,61,,
362,0.97,3693.489,3697.827,I can't say with certainty that I know.,62,,
363,0.97,3697.827,3705.301,I could read a book that the Rv could be included in the term property.,62,,
364,0.97,3705.301,3716.646,Or we could be talking about the things that people had stored in the Rv so I would have to clarify with Hsd on that.,62,,
365,0.97,3716.646,3718.081,I want to take this opportunity.,63,,
366,0.97,3718.081,3780.877,I don't know that is necessarily a budget issue but I want to take this opportunity to flag my concern that with the resumption of the 72 hour enforcement of the 72 hour in this even with very narrow use of the enforcement power on vehicles operating by residents if the end of the enforcement result in a vehicle going or Rv going to be auctioned I remain concerned that we will continue to trigger the Homestead act protections and for that reason we might want to expedite our efforts to have Rvs that are impounded and go to a different place other than Lincoln Towing to be auctioned.,63,,
367,0.97,3780.877,3790.086,That is the thing that triggers the potential for the Homestead act protections.,63,,
368,0.97,3790.086,3794.757,Which was just putting the city back in court again.,63,,
369,0.97,3794.757,3815.845,I think having another place to store people's R vs could address that potential legal vulnerability as well as provide a really important barrier for people Accessing housing who are currently--living in their Rvs.,63,,
370,0.97,3815.845,3816.946,I talk about this all the time.,63,,
371,0.97,3816.946,3837.567,This is just a little bit of a new I think twist than what I have talked about before because I am adding the complexity associated with the resumption of the enforcement of the 72 hour notice.,63,,
372,0.97,3837.567,3838.835,Thank you Councilmember Herbold.,64,,
373,0.97,3838.835,3846.008,Well said as we try to create trust and relationships for folks to bring them inside when we have shelter options available.,64,,
374,0.97,3846.008,3857.753,We will move on to issue identification and Councilmember Lewis of course we would love to hear from you and all of you Councilmember Gonzelez.,65,,
375,0.97,3857.753,3861.357,I know you both sit on the Rha.,65,,
376,0.97,3861.357,3873.102,A number of questions and interesting concepts and I'm reading for the first time in this member and look forward to unpacking this with your leadership.,65,,
377,0.97,3873.102,3878.307,Let's go ahead.,65,,
378,0.97,3878.307,3886.849,Jeff.,65,,
379,0.97,3886.849,3891.454,That will be me Tra Ci Ratcliffe.,65,,
380,0.97,3891.454,3892.922,This are for end complements.,65,,
381,0.97,3892.922,3926.255,"2022 proposed budget to keep the funding for the hope team at $1.2 million and would add $900,000 of new general funds and 6.5Ftes in Seattle parks and recreation for work that had been performed by the navigation team and as it relates to facilitating the city's process for assessing and Prioritizing Unsanctioned encampment sites for other site conditions and for carrying out activities in and around camps on s DOT Right-Of-Ways.",65,,
382,0.97,3926.255,3940.569,Your options are to remove funding from the 2022 proposed budget for SPR and to move part or all of the team to another city Department or to the King County regional housing authority or no action.,65,,
383,0.97,3940.569,3950.279,There is a table on page 9 of the memo.,65,,
384,0.97,3950.279,3966.395,And that Jeff and I put together to show you the staffing from 2020 to the proposed 2022 budget to give you a better sense of what is happening in terms of the movements of positions and the numbers of people involved in this body of work.,65,,
385,0.97,3966.395,3966.729,Actually.,66,,
386,0.97,3966.729,3969.065,We can go and this is fine.,66,,
387,0.97,3969.065,3972.735,It is in the power point broken up.,66,,
388,0.97,3972.735,3974.136,Is this Legible enough for everybody?,66,,
389,0.97,3974.136,3974.403,Yes.,67,,
390,0.97,3974.403,3974.837,That looks great.,67,,
391,0.97,3974.837,3984.38,And we will just stick with this here and in the power point presentation and we had to make sure it was readable and put it on two slides.,68,,
392,0.97,3984.38,4015.778,And just so that we all have an understanding here and if you are looking at the power point presentation that was attached to the memo things are out of order and took the lines where logistics and operations clean up and data analysis and put that first since the positions would be added and moved everything else to the bottom onto the next slide essentially so Councilmembers would have the new positions on one page.,68,,
393,0.97,4015.778,4020.049,What you see the first level identifies fraud categories that we would place these positions into.,68,,
394,0.97,4020.049,4065.227,And I want to be clear that this is not an exact science and a lot of the work that positions could fall in different ways and to some degree a feel coordinator and I was thinking and saying this earlier if you have someone going to Councilmember Lewis and your question about what would be the city teams and not interacting with anyone and unlikely that field Coordinators are walking through and they have someone interested in a shelter and keep walking and they are going to engage that person often because they may know of some resources and how to contact the system navigator to get them connected with services.,68,,
395,0.97,4065.227,4071.267,This was all to say that Categorization you see with the first column here might not be perfect.,68,,
396,0.97,4071.267,4080.943,And some of these jobs can be in multiple places and we couldn't split them without being confusing.,68,,
397,0.97,4080.943,4082.611,"The 2020 budget, the navigation team on its largest size.",68,,
398,0.97,4082.611,4090.953,We historically would not have shown the special maintenance team as a specific number of Ftes.,68,,
399,0.97,4090.953,4104.6,We used to treat that as a dollar sign and it is perform to note how the staff changed and Traci can talk about that.,68,,
400,0.97,4104.6,4131.827,The 2021 adopted budget if you will remember in the mid year supplemental last year the Council Defunded the staff that were in Hsd as part of the navigation team and then the 2021 adopted budget replaced what had been the team with the hope team.,68,,
401,0.97,4131.827,4134.997,And homelessness Ecosystem.,68,,
402,0.97,4134.997,4146.008,It is basically what you can see here and Traci will go into the park position.,68,,
403,0.97,4146.008,4148.811,What is proposed in 2022 budget.,68,,
404,0.97,4148.811,4165.427,It doesn't stand out here but we have put in I italics the newly proposed positions.,68,,
405,0.97,4165.427,4171.7,As I indicated earlier the special maintenance team is existence since 2018 and that continues.,69,,
406,0.97,4171.7,4181.343,The one change that took place in--it doesn't show here.,69,,
407,0.97,4181.343,4183.712,Should have shown in 2020.,69,,
408,0.97,4183.712,4207.703,"They took a couple of maintenance folks and made them Coordinators because of their Uderstanding for example, the issues around storage and personal belonging and what has to happen so they created out of 15 member team two feel coordinator positions and would continue to 2022.",69,,
409,0.97,4207.703,4217.246,2022 would add two additional field Coordinators and strategic adviser and SPR to support the work of the field Coordinators and the work happening out on the sites.,69,,
410,0.97,4217.246,4244.273,Again one of those are sites that are in fact in line for a closure or whether there is ongoing assessment on encampment sides whether they are on a closure list to make sure that there are public safety issues being addressed and no issues erupting that needs to be addressed.,69,,
411,0.97,4244.273,4260.222,There's the addition of a person to help with storage and to make sure storage is done properly and helping with the actual Facilitation when people say they want to get their goods and storage and helping with the delivery of that.,69,,
412,0.97,4260.222,4301.63,"And then the final two positions, one is a communication adviser and this is somebody that is helping to deal with apparently the myriad of Emails and calls that come to the parks Department about Encampments with them taking on some of the role on an interim basis in 2021 and that can be from citizens from the press and from Councilmembers and other elected officials and the Semifinal position in 2022 is full time data analyst and this relates to the requirement that was exist for needing to keep a track of when we have met the requirements for postings.",69,,
413,0.97,4301.63,4313.309,Again requirements around storage and keeping track of storage and how that happens for clients.,69,,
414,0.97,4313.309,4320.716,And residents of the Encampments.,69,,
415,0.97,4320.716,4321.15,Okay.,69,,
416,0.97,4321.15,4321.45,Wonderful.,69,,
417,0.97,4321.45,4325.554,I know Councilmember Lewis and Morales has questions on this.,69,,
418,0.97,4325.554,4327.022,Councilmember Lewis go ahead.,69,,
419,0.97,4327.022,4327.589,"Thank you, Madam chair.",70,,
420,0.97,4327.589,4337.232,Going back to the themes that I was discussing earlier and I think this chart is a good ground exercise to talk about this.,70,,
421,0.97,4337.232,4340.369,I again you know--this is flagging issues.,70,,
422,0.97,4340.369,4353.282,I feel like this is to a certain extent red flagging issues opinion like I want us to make sure that we don't go to a regime in 2022 that it is unclear who is responsible for doing what.,70,,
423,0.97,4353.282,4370.999,"And like just going through this list, you know I know that so just cares for example, and mark at the regional authority is a big fan of the model for outreach that just care folks use.",70,,
424,0.97,4370.999,4378.107,That incorporates some level of planning and strategy around storage or possessions for example.,70,,
425,0.97,4378.107,4401.597,And you know like really having individualized plans for people on how they can Spore their possessions and mitigate moving inside in terms of balancing stuff they have in their encampment and moving it to a hotel room and engaging in some sort of storage system.,70,,
426,0.97,4401.597,4407.202,And I sense that is kind of the outreach direction that authority wants to go in.,70,,
427,0.97,4407.202,4416.879,And so I just wonder as we go forward the extent to which some of the things that we historically.,70,,
428,0.97,4416.879,4431.026,If something gets removed and someone is not in the encampment site and we need to make sure that stuff is properly stored and not thrown away.,70,,
429,0.97,4431.026,4442.738,I am envisioning I want to make sure we are building city assets and the division of laborer as what we as a city are doing and what the authorities are going to be doing.,70,,
430,0.97,4442.738,4459.922,And the build out that we have been presented for 2022 seems to envision similar approach in the world where the authority exists.,70,,
431,0.97,4459.922,4494.256,The data analyst position I think is probably that something is not as necessary because the authority will have a data analyst position and we are not creating redundancies between the hope outreach and the authority outreach and I definitely don't want a regime to have competing outreach teams that have competing proprietary shelter systems and as we lean into this reconciling clearly delineated roles will be critical.,70,,
432,0.97,4494.256,4514.71,I don't know if we have sufficient answers right now from the authority on exactly how their outreach system will be developed and if we go back to the issue of identification and I want to keep this up here Councilmember Morales may have questions relevant to this and we don't have to go back there.,70,,
433,0.97,4514.71,4524.853,And I would like you to come back to me--I will just do it now if we are going back and Cueing it up.,70,,
434,0.97,4524.853,4530.225,I don't feel that I can answer this.,70,,
435,0.97,4530.225,4570.632,Definitely not see but I don't really know exactly what combination of a and B would be appropriate at this time because we don't really know exactly what the King County regional homelessness authority outreach regime will look like but we need to make sure that we are designing a whole team that compliments or whatever SA successor function that compliments the King County regional housing authority outreach program and not making this an isolation in a way to Chaff up to those responsibilities.,70,,
436,0.97,4570.632,4572.267,That can be wasteful Redundance and problematic.,70,,
437,0.97,4572.267,4576.905,I can speak to some of this.,71,,
438,0.97,4576.905,4582.578,I think highlighting a Councilmember that is kind of a policy decision.,71,,
439,0.97,4582.578,4634.863,But what is moving currently to the authority obviously nothing is done until the Council enacts the budget is that only the contracts would be moving that are to the contract agencies would be moving to the regional authority and as I was saying earlier Maybe there is a citywide certain type of population as is often the case and they had a similar role and the--was the work done by the system navigators initially through contract negotiations and Hsd did propose having that day of removal kind of work to make sure that someone is still there on the day that clean-up arrives and someone would be there from an outreach agency.,71,,
440,0.97,4634.863,4690.752,"And the agency was clear they were not comfortable with that work and they indicated that would undermine their authority to engage with the Encampments that were Prioritized for removal and, therefore, we would continue to have system navigators serving as the primary group there that is on the day of the removal or to the degree that you have a few days like three days to two weeks in this of a posting nearby and to the individuals doing the coordination to learn who has been talked to in the Encampments and a person living there and the needs and the type of shelters and things like that and with that part of the city and where it is supposed to be at and the best location with parks and with Hsd and the authority and some components.",71,,
441,0.97,4690.752,4705.067,I don't know I can present Etch answer for that but there is a clear role that is delineated from what our general contract agencies are doing right now.,71,,
442,0.97,4705.067,4710.972,And I hope that is helpful to understand that.,71,,
443,0.97,4710.972,4712.007,Does that answer your question?,71,,
444,0.97,4712.007,4736.998,I guess what I'm talking about because I do understand what the--I do understand the idea here that under no circumstances will Kchra will be in the removal business or the contracts participate in the removal business.,72,,
445,0.97,4736.998,4737.466,That ace completely.,72,,
446,0.97,4737.466,4745.941,My concern is situations where like a fact pattern that could come up where--that I think is pretty easy to envision.,72,,
447,0.97,4745.941,4779.307,"I don't think it is Far-Fetched where the King County regional homelessness authority contacted providers at the site and there is a lot of demand for the site to be removed and creating a lot of political pressure and it gets to a point that the authority that controls the hope team, whatever it is, parks, S DOT, whatever it is, kind of loses patience for the outreach and doesn't want to give them time and decides to post and do a removal, right?",72,,
448,0.97,4779.307,4811.273,And at that point it sounds like what would happen is Casey Rhas outreach contractors would no longer be involved because they don't want to be involved in Sweeps and no longer required to be contractually because of the new addition of labor but the system navigator people that are in this successor hope team and they would be doing something that is kind of like outreach and the posting for lack of a better term environment of the site.,72,,
449,0.97,4811.273,4833.662,My concern is a world where whatever the successor hope team is just goes around and posts on a pretty much frequent basis and Turfs out the Khr people so the outreach stops and we are back to being in the same associate of sweeping driven regime.,72,,
450,0.97,4833.662,4844.072,I am Conjuring up where I am seeing the systems having trouble interacting potentially.,72,,
451,0.97,4844.072,4844.906,Maybe that world wouldn't happen.,72,,
452,0.97,4844.906,4859.588,Maybe in the ideal world what I think would be best would be King County regional homelessness authority given the time and the space and the support that they need to do comprehensive outreach and a person centered plan for everybody in sight.,72,,
453,0.97,4859.588,4872.2,You know do like a just care style moving day where everybody moves at once to go into sheltering or housing opportunities and then it gets flagged for a posting to remove debris because the people are gone.,72,,
454,0.97,4872.2,4884.045,And the only thing that is left is things that the people have determined that were camping there are debris to be removed from the city.,72,,
455,0.97,4884.045,4889.551,This doesn't seem to be a whole team that is designed for that kind of function.,72,,
456,0.97,4889.551,4896.291,That is the issue I'm trying to get through.,72,,
457,0.97,4896.291,4907.502,And the place where I'm seeing the diagram overlapping with the authority potentially becoming problematic and creating redundancies.,72,,
458,0.97,4907.502,4921.917,Does that provide more clarification on like is it justified and are there things to do to legislate around that?,72,,
459,0.97,4921.917,4926.621,I think your precisely describing how the process works right now.,73,,
460,0.97,4926.621,4932.36,The hope team doesn't do the posting itself right now.,73,,
461,0.97,4932.36,4933.995,"That is handled by parks, really park staff.",73,,
462,0.97,4933.995,4936.998,They do that on behalf of s DOT.,73,,
463,0.97,4936.998,4962.557,"That is what the feel coordinator, it has been months since we talked about that but one of the things that field coordinator does and assess the site and determine a priority for removal and put that notice of removal up and take a photo and make sure it gets documented and so all of those functions are not happening even with the existing team and are not going to be something that the future hope team would take on.",73,,
464,0.97,4962.557,4976.504,And instead the existing hope team in the future would largely serve the same roll that it is right now that I described and hopefully to some degree with clarity and pretty convoluted body of work.,73,,
465,0.97,4976.504,4983.845,That there is a lot of overlap and it is confusing at times.,73,,
466,0.97,4983.845,4989.617,The approach right now is that parks are s DOT or Whoever identified it.,73,,
467,0.97,4989.617,4993.221,There is the priority for removal.,73,,
468,0.97,4993.221,5025.487,"That posting is put up and things changed and the model you are describing that a place is identified as removal and intention not to post that removal notice and to have a focus all collapse upon that location and make sure that people are moved out of that location and that work and signal is complete by contract providers and then the team comes in and does the clean that, would certainly be a change in the staging of how we do our process right now.",73,,
469,0.97,5025.487,5044.472,And I don't know the degree to which the legislation could accomplish this and I think it would be stand alone legislation to do that approach and something that exists currently as administrative role.,73,,
470,0.97,5044.472,5048.51,There's no reason that can't be enacted by the Council to have staging and process.,73,,
471,0.97,5048.51,5054.315,"Thank you for clarifying that for me, Jeff.",74,,
472,0.97,5054.315,5117.879,I want a signal almost like an option D. I think we need to know about the King County regional homelessness outreach plans and I would like to build the residual city response is around how King County regional authority will Operationize their outreach and design it in such a way that we Incentivize collaborative and results AR oriented collaboration that minimizes displace many and eliminates displace many and I don't want a system where we are continuing to go to one camping location and displaces people in another place and creates new problems for one community and while at the same time not doing things for people Unhoused.,74,,
473,0.97,5117.879,5127.689,I think we have a unique opportunity to do that with the resources coming Online and the new energy from the King County regional homelessness authority.,74,,
474,0.97,5127.689,5145.44,I want to flag that we don't talk about this publicly but one of the issues why it is harder to stay in shelters there are providers that won set up a resource if the referrals are coming from something that they deem to be a sweep.,74,,
475,0.97,5145.44,5170.598,I know we have a lot of shelter provider capacity issues and part of this is I have had the conversations and I won't say who they are publicly with providers where we take sweep referrals and respond to Rfus.,74,,
476,0.97,5170.598,5190.018,"This struck at me as structural issue that makes it harder to stand up to capacity and have a policy that minimizes displace many and I don't want to, when we are deciding where to allocate limited resources and about to discuss other resource ads.",74,,
477,0.97,5190.018,5207.068,I want to look at everything that is not creating redundancies and we are creating things to get people off of the streets and inside and in so doing reduce the amount of Encampments.,74,,
478,0.97,5207.068,5211.039,Thank you Councilmember Lewis.,75,,
479,0.97,5211.039,5213.641,Well side and did I hear somebody else?,75,,
480,0.97,5213.641,5215.21,Traci did I interrupt you?,75,,
481,0.97,5215.21,5215.977,No.,76,,
482,0.97,5215.977,5216.311,Well said.,77,,
483,0.97,5216.311,5219.347,Councilmember Morales anything you would like to say in terms of questions?,77,,
484,0.97,5219.347,5229.49,I just want to reiterate the point and maybe put a slightly different comment on what Councilmember Lewis made.,78,,
485,0.97,5229.49,5244.405,It was true that providers don't want to take referrals from the city and navigation and there shouldn't be a navigation team and the city's cleaning crews making referrals to services is a completely inappropriate roll.,78,,
486,0.97,5244.405,5284.245,The reason we set up the hope team is that there would be a relationship there with providers and that providers would be making referrals for folks that are experiencing homelessness and I think this idea of replacing the work that navigation team had been doing is just fundamentally flawed and say right now we should be advocating for option Aand we don't fund those positions because we have a lot of work to do to figure out how to make this a more compassionate system than what exists right now.,78,,
487,0.97,5284.245,5292.053,And I do agree that we probably need to learn a little bit more about what the outreach plan is from the authority.,78,,
488,0.97,5292.053,5294.656,Thank you very much.,79,,
489,0.97,5294.656,5303.364,I know that on the slide it says issue identification and we have four issues to identify here.,79,,
490,0.97,5303.364,5303.598,Slides.,79,,
491,0.97,5303.598,5306.267,Carried out to show the issue and the possible options.,79,,
492,0.97,5306.267,5321.816,We have three more issues to go through and I did want to ask a quick question related to the role of the outreach providers specifically that we have cultivated with read and reach.,79,,
493,0.97,5321.816,5329.29,I didn't get to ask this at the beginning.,79,,
494,0.97,5329.29,5329.824,The 2021 adopted budget.,79,,
495,0.97,5329.824,5334.862,"6.1 million for lead for example, and you don't see that in the 2022 budget.",79,,
496,0.97,5334.862,5335.93,It shows nothing.,79,,
497,0.97,5335.93,5353.014,Remind me because it is dollars going to King County as we had hoped that just care program and where is that partnership and investments with lead and reach?,79,,
498,0.97,5353.014,5357.585,And the 2022 proposed budget as transmitted by the Mayor?,79,,
499,0.97,5357.585,5368.596,[Indiscernible] it is being transferred to--there may be looking for a certain Acronym.,80,,
500,0.97,5368.596,5374.168,That is being moved to the safe and stable communities division in Hsd.,80,,
501,0.97,5374.168,5396.991,And that is one of the transfers for the presentation and that you don't see it listed here in homelessness services and that happens to be a division placed previously and in terms of as you probably NOTE the just care approach is different and in a lot of ways from what lead is.,80,,
502,0.97,5396.991,5408.136,And it happens to be spare Hided by the public defender Association that is Renaming and I can't think what PDA is branded as.,80,,
503,0.97,5408.136,5441.769,And that--so the Council has provided funds in two different ways for that program and one of which is to start services and it has come Online for 89 beds and wholly city funded and those beds will come off lines and I believe in June of 20 and 22 and then separately the Seattle rescue plan provides 7- And-A-Half million to combine with the county for just care and this was 150 bed allotment.,80,,
504,0.97,5441.769,5465.96,The county was fund that contract and seeking our collaboration and that award had been made and made that award to PDA and partners and collaboration with in coming referral services and so just care receives the fund and continued to operate and expected to halt services in June of 2022 as well I believe.,80,,
505,0.97,5465.96,5483.711,And on June 30th and what has happened so far you won't see any draw down on the funds and the report that you refer to that you received this morning on Seattle rescue plan funds.,80,,
506,0.97,5483.711,5484.979,Those funds are encumbered.,80,,
507,0.97,5484.979,5501.295,There is a contract in place and for whatever reason the county funds are what we were drawing down first for the first six months and from January 1ST to June 30th next year is when we are going to draw down the Hsd Fund.,80,,
508,0.97,5501.295,5501.596,Thanks.,81,,
509,0.97,5501.596,5524.285,I did see a reference to the shelter program that the hotel was expected to seize expectations first and reducing temporary capacity for 197 units and the city will support the 150 beds through just cares.,81,,
510,0.97,5524.285,5525.853,"Exactly, yes.",82,,
511,0.97,5525.853,5534.295,And that is a little bit of a nuance because what that chart is showing shelter capacity and not showing County funded capacity.,82,,
512,0.97,5534.295,5544.338,And so since our dollars are not taking effect for the just care 150 beds that King County had been operating.,82,,
513,0.97,5544.338,5556.717,That is how that display is coming on and being added to the actual charge of March 2022 and January 1ST and points in times what is Online.,82,,
514,0.97,5556.717,5567.228,Let's go ahead and move to issue--excuse me Councilmember Pedersen.,82,,
515,0.97,5567.228,5568.93,Did you have something on issue identification?,82,,
516,0.97,5568.93,5581.008,Thank you chairman Mosqueda and Jeff Sims and for your work on this and just wanted to support the remarks of the homelessness chair Councilmember Lewis in terms of getting more information.,82,,
517,0.97,5581.008,5617.478,I think if we go back to the slide showing the chart with the positions I think what is interesting is that at the bottom where it total totals the positions there were 46 positions that drops down to 23 and it seems that what the Mayor is--Mayor's budget is proposing to maintain the hope type structure but to add a few positions and I think we do need more information on how it would coordinate with the regional homelessness authority.,82,,
518,0.97,5617.478,5626.52,I supported the navigation team and did not want it to be disbanded and I wanted the hope team to work and they are just asking for a few more positions here.,82,,
519,0.97,5626.52,5653.114,And to make it work and there may be a timing issue and as we know the regional homelessness authority are staffing up and putting forth plans and timing when the contracts transferred over and let new contracts and so maybe this--what--might make sense in 2022.,82,,
520,0.97,5653.114,5697.058,I will reserve judgment on this until we get more information and just wanted to provide a little bit of more perspective on this issue because I know--I am seeing a lot of unauthorized Encampments and a desire to engage and to get people inside covering a line from Councilmember Lewis' support to Inventorying those units and to see the city housing to get people experiencing homelessness and so we are running on all Clinders here and just might be a transition period.,82,,
521,0.97,5697.058,5698.225,"Thank you, chair.",82,,
522,0.97,5698.225,5699.36,Thank you Councilmember Pedersen.,83,,
523,0.97,5699.36,5704.231,I just want to--I was going to raise this with Councilmember Lewis.,84,,
524,0.97,5704.231,5707.935,But just didn't--wasn't sure it was appropriate.,84,,
525,0.97,5707.935,5718.312,I will make sure that my understanding is that the regional authority did not do anything about the contracts that will be inherited from Hfy in 2022.,84,,
526,0.97,5718.312,5758.252,So as things operate now with outreach is how it will operate for the duration of 2022 and how they will change the outreach services the current plan that is articulated in the spring of 2022 to issue a new Rfp that would redesign some programs and let's assume the homelessness out reach would have services that we couldn't guess at this point and if there is any degree of services and go through a contracting process on January 1ST of 2023 is when you would see a change in how the authorities are operating outreach services.,84,,
527,0.97,5758.252,5758.652,In the interim.,84,,
528,0.97,5758.652,5777.438,And I don't know if I made it clear enough because I was often--in the interim other than the agency that is responsible for the contracts there shouldn't be any change to how those providers are expected to operate and also there is not an expansion of the hope team.,84,,
529,0.97,5777.438,5783.344,None of these positions would be defined as part of the hope team.,84,,
530,0.97,5783.344,5796.69,"Úi know that during a meeting last week that Mayor Washington talk about spreading out the hope team and got clarification that intention, you could call it lending, I think that she used that word.",84,,
531,0.97,5796.69,5830.157,Loaning staff and got into--it gets technical in terms of that and ultimately that would be continue to be Hsd employees working in some kind of a management and multiple like lines of communication and decision making to wit the park staff as well and the actual hope hope team would not be changed to or added and only additions in parks that be would be occurring.,84,,
532,0.97,5830.157,5831.091,The following question.,85,,
533,0.97,5831.091,5832.693,Okay.,85,,
534,0.97,5832.693,5833.194,Great clarification.,85,,
535,0.97,5833.194,5834.562,"Thanks for sharing that, Jeff with everyone.",85,,
536,0.97,5834.562,5894.822,"And not only is it that they would--they being the regional homelessness authority would honor the 2022 contracts, I believe I saw that there was also interest in a commitment for the 2022 contracts and any Stipulations that the Council has around those contracts that we can ensure continuities of service in 2022 and not as in the--I thought many of you are and that was a good signal of trying to ensure transition and stability for those contracts and as Councilmember Lewis started with, we receive calls about this every day and we see the trauma that so many people are experiencing ourselves on a daily basis and we want there to be continuity for the additional services and solutions and I appreciate there is a commitment to contracts in 2022 and any additional Stipulations that Council may have related to some of those contracts and/or in partnership with the Mayor's office as well.",85,,
537,0.97,5894.822,5899.693,And a good thing for us in 2022 as we think about stability.,85,,
538,0.97,5899.693,5909.069,So that was a good note to receive.,85,,
539,0.97,5909.069,5909.27,Okay.,85,,
540,0.97,5909.27,5915.109,Let's move to issue number two of four.,85,,
541,0.97,5915.109,5917.645,Need to keep going.,85,,
542,0.97,5917.645,5918.846,One more slide please.,85,,
543,0.97,5918.846,5919.313,Here we go.,85,,
544,0.97,5919.313,5919.513,Yes.,85,,
545,0.97,5919.513,5928.922,I was talking about the number of pages and that wasn't the way to handle it.,85,,
546,0.97,5928.922,5929.29,No problem.,86,,
547,0.97,5929.29,5953.48,This next issue combines ultimately a request from the King County regional homelessness authority to add some fund to the Mayor's proposed budget and I will talk about two programmatic or service ads and the next one I will go into more administrative ones.,87,,
548,0.97,5953.48,5987.781,The local agreement that was authorized by the city Council and governs the authority and envisions a scenario where process where the authority will develop in the springtime and a budget submission and go to the two boards and Unbiased efforts and for elected officials and both of whom giving approval to that submission and then it gets transmit to the city and county for incorporation to the budget processes that we normally go through.,87,,
549,0.97,5987.781,6000.928,So that Ideally it gets down to what the Mayor proposes and the Council and sees it as being well prepared and gets pasted this part of the larger budget passage.,87,,
550,0.97,6000.928,6004.631,As I believe everyone is aware that wasn't realistic for 2021.,87,,
551,0.97,6004.631,6012.606,There were not staff at the original authority except for some that did not come on board until that budget would have had to be submitted.,87,,
552,0.97,6012.606,6023.45,For that reason that is why the Council is submitted to them now as potential new services and new asks for additions.,87,,
553,0.97,6023.45,6035.129,"The first of those, it is a Acuity shelter.",87,,
554,0.97,6035.129,6065.492,The sum existing space would be leased similar to how the Soto shelter that is being operated by salvation Army worked and imagine people have done simple math and noted for 150 beds this would be expensive innovation and the reason when we call this a high Acuity shelter it is truly that.,87,,
555,0.97,6065.492,6077.037,It would exceed greatly not only the services that we typically offer in our shelters but in some ways what we offer for housing.,87,,
556,0.97,6077.037,6085.946,"And you would have for example, psychiatric nurse practitioners and a doctor and multiple nurses and it is intended to be people that are truly in crisis.",87,,
557,0.97,6085.946,6119.279,And the parallel that I would say that this should more be compared to what we typically operate is the crisis solution center and which is a program that where it can be a 72 hour stabilization period for people in crisis and they can stabilize and up to that up to a 14-Day additional stay for people that would have had to exit the homelessness and very time permitted and intense in services.,87,,
558,0.97,6119.279,6137.231,It is four people that are truly in crisis and that is the first one and the second Street request is for a navigator network.,87,,
559,0.97,6137.231,6140.367,Seven-And-A-Half million dollars for a 69 person network.,87,,
560,0.97,6140.367,6149.143,The difference from a pure navigator and when we are Correspondly used to dealing to a case management is that a case manage works with you in a program.,87,,
561,0.97,6149.143,6151.245,At the shelter the case manager works with you.,87,,
562,0.97,6151.245,6157.417,When you leave the shelter you get a new case manager and so on and so forth.,87,,
563,0.97,6157.417,6203.463,The vision with the pure navigator network when you enter the shelter potentially depending on who is assigned you would be assigned this pure navigator and they are your mentor and your advocate and your Soundingboard and someone that has walked through this before and stay with that individual that they are assigned to all the way they are placed into permanent housing or identified from that house Og their own and at that point in time you wouldn't necessarily remove the person that they have been assigned to but as we have all experienced in other times your need for services drops off for the most part and replace and find a new something for that.,87,,
564,0.97,6203.463,6217.477,There is a mentor to Meantee advocate to clients and Pairing and initially the 69 person team is--this is one of the reasons that I noted the downtown plan.,87,,
565,0.97,6217.477,6261.989,This would be a key aspect and support of the people that are experiencing unsheltered homelessness move into those offerings to be updated and the last thing I will say about this the $7.6 million is presented as a one-time funding request and there was the intention to pursue the development and the billing structures and Setups so that can be a Medicaid bill service and there is some money that will have to happen and that's the reason the authority want to to directly manage this program and so that process needs to be completed and Medicaid reversible.,87,,
566,0.97,6261.989,6269.997,And I think I failed to mention that high Acuity shelter that appeared in the plan that I presented earlier.,87,,
567,0.97,6269.997,6276.036,With that I will stop if anyone has questions.,87,,
568,0.97,6276.036,6276.403,Thank you.,88,,
569,0.97,6276.403,6277.07,Councilmember Herbold go ahead.,88,,
570,0.97,6277.07,6289.75,I have a question about the high Acuity shelter being questioned by the regional housing authority.,89,,
571,0.97,6289.75,6342.402,And there was behavioral health summit and the number of us participated in both from city of Seattle government as well as King County government and a couple dozen riders and recommendations that came out of that summit is to expand and regional crisis stabilization center capacity by opening voluntarily crisis diversion and stabilization centers and available at facilities and pro Potioned as joint city County investment.,89,,
572,0.97,6342.402,6376.503,"And this proposal refers to the fact under true blood the state and county are already working to build two Invollen stair stabilization centers and this would be a voluntary facility and receive referrals from folks that are first responders and police, fire and Emts and hospitals and trying to figure out--it has been compared to the crisis solution center.",89,,
573,0.97,6376.503,6381.541,Are we talking about the same proposal here?,89,,
574,0.97,6381.541,6424.684,Your exactly on to pinpoint the overlap and not quite exactly and rising conversations with what you just discussed arising out of the summit as recommendation and the high Acuity shelter and the memo that the exit plan is not firmly determined at this point where as the--there is a cap as long you can be there and my understanding there would be something similar and the terminology that I received the material on describes it as Respid and not something that you would staying in for a year or six months.,90,,
575,0.97,6424.684,6430.991,And I think that might be where there is a difference.,90,,
576,0.97,6430.991,6437.964,And in terms of the services I think we are talking about the same thing.,90,,
577,0.97,6437.964,6443.069,Thank you very much.,91,,
578,0.97,6443.069,6444.371,Thank you Councilmember.,91,,
579,0.97,6444.371,6444.838,Councilmember Lewis.,91,,
580,0.97,6444.838,6446.807,Thank you Madam chair.,91,,
581,0.97,6446.807,6458.618,You know I think that this really cues up what we frequently hear from a lot of people in the community in general terms.,91,,
582,0.97,6458.618,6474.835,About what their vision is for our response to people with very severe crisis that clearly need some kind of really Resourced assistance and we can't provide it.,91,,
583,0.97,6474.835,6480.907,And this offers a really stark reminder of how much that cost.,91,,
584,0.97,6480.907,6517.911,And I think it offers a really stark reminder that intensive care for significant substance addiction and mental health issues is very expensive and this is an asset that is envisioned by the King County regional authority that they are very excited about implementing and that they have a plan that is designed to meet the need and across the political spectrum there is what we need.,91,,
585,0.97,6517.911,6525.218,We are sort of on the record in public.,91,,
586,0.97,6525.218,6541.735,People in the community with strong opinions about wanting to see bigger investment in the underlying public health issues are feeding into our homelessness crisis.,91,,
587,0.97,6541.735,6551.478,This is working with the authority on realizing what that is and this is a horrible reminder that it is not going to be an easy lift nor is it cheap.,91,,
588,0.97,6551.478,6553.88,But it is necessary.,91,,
589,0.97,6553.88,6564.791,And I really do think that realize the kind of--the kind of reality on the street that all of us want to see.,91,,
590,0.97,6564.791,6571.831,It will require an investment of this magnitude and likely considerably more.,91,,
591,0.97,6571.831,6590.483,This is a way to demonstrate the efficacy of the strategy and the way to get this resource going so the regional homelessness authority has what they need to demonstrate and show that this new regional approach can really deliver on what we need to see.,91,,
592,0.97,6590.483,6614.708,"So you know I do think that this is something that I want to pursue throughout the budget process and it is definitely a big ask from the new regional authority is something that they really, really think that they could implement and show strong visible results from.",91,,
593,0.97,6614.708,6649.009,So you know my priority would be to go for the option a and visit option B as necessitated and I want to work on the peer navigator network to make sure we are putting in strong feedback from the coalition and I know they have expressed early feedback on the pure navigator model and really want to make sure that they are able to lend their expertise to shape how that is going to work.,91,,
594,0.97,6649.009,6667.861,And so I definitely want to as we go forward in fund that request and consult closely with the coalition and make sure that we are designing a program firmly in alignment with them.,91,,
595,0.97,6667.861,6674.067,That's all I have to add.,91,,
596,0.97,6674.067,6683.743,Thank you Councilmember Lewis.,92,,
597,0.97,6683.743,6684.144,Other colleagues.,92,,
598,0.97,6684.144,6684.644,Councilmember Gonzelez.,92,,
599,0.97,6684.644,6700.86,I want to echo my support of the sort of the way to pursue this at this juncture in our process.,93,,
600,0.97,6700.86,6715.642,And a fully funded plan would provide in terms of additional resources to Kcha to address the needs of chronically homeless folks living outside and surviving outside.,93,,
601,0.97,6715.642,6802.462,"I do want to just flag that one of the things that will need more analysis in the Council's ongoing evaluation of how much we find these particular proposals in addition to needing to consult with the coalition around the pure navigator network as proposed here is that we are still in need of addressing a plan and so if we are going to have a high Acuity shelter it would be I think helpful and wise for us to get understanding from our H Astaff on what their strategy is going to be to transition people out of that high Acuity shelter to housing and affordable housing because as Jeff mentioned in his comments, for this amount of money we could be standing up a new permanent support housing project and those are the I think the--those are policy choices that are before us as we continue to wrestle with the scale of investments that the city of Seattle is willing to commit to for next year's Rha efforts.",93,,
602,0.97,6802.462,6812.472,I have a series of questions that I am hoping the next few weeks we will have a chance to understand more about specific peer navigator program.,94,,
603,0.97,6812.472,6834.36,I am interested in knowing additional details about what it takes to become a certified peer counselor and the process to then be licensed with that official title to actually get reimbursed for Medicaid.,94,,
604,0.97,6834.36,6855.682,I know that we have had lots of conversations have been had about this and on the Acuity shelter I am interesting to hear about operators in the city and the folks from the models that Councilmember Herbold noted.,94,,
605,0.97,6855.682,6884.043,Obviously they have been the ones that I have been most concerned about with the Scaling down of their beds from over five hundred to near one hundred now and hopefully Scaling up to 350 beds in the city by the end of the year and a deficit of 150 beds from DFC and interested in hearing from Community partners like that and folks around the DFC crisis solution center.,94,,
606,0.97,6884.043,6888.648,And I would also like to hear more about the partnership with King County.,94,,
607,0.97,6888.648,6950.31,And I think that there was a big emphasis on creating economy to scale as we partnered with King County and hearing more about how King County and Seattle are Partnering together to address some of these late ads and I say late because your outline initially if everything were on time and in terms of the creation of the homelessness authority and we didn't have the Covid and all of the other hiccups we would have recommendations in the spring to influence the Mayor's proposed budget and interested in hearing about the committee and the implementation committee and the lid experience committee has coalesce about this as well and looking forward to hear about those elements as we go to this proposal and what others have said we need urgent action and as we head to winter to show there is a place to move into and that is the goal here.,94,,
608,0.97,6950.31,6963.222,I would like to know more about the leasing and the modifications of the facility right now and noted that we do not have the acquisition of the location for the services yet.,94,,
609,0.97,6963.222,6963.623,In the memo.,94,,
610,0.97,6963.623,6977.437,All of those things to make sure we can hit the ground running with this magnitude of existing partners and like to see how we do that.,94,,
611,0.97,6977.437,6983.242,"Jeff, let me know if we need clarification on some of those questions that I rattled off.",94,,
612,0.97,6983.242,6983.476,No.,95,,
613,0.97,6983.476,6997.19,Did you want to.,95,,
614,0.97,6997.19,7003.262,"This next item, I noted already the program Mattic or service request from the authority.",96,,
615,0.97,7003.262,7016.542,"There also is request for an additional $600,000 to cover a shortfall in what they anticipate to be the shortfall in their administrative costs, and there's kind of two different factors that are at play here.",96,,
616,0.97,7016.542,7034.093,"So ultimately the question to the Council would be to fully or partially address some of that gap, but also because some of the funding that is proposed for the authority's own administration is a jump start payroll expense tax.",96,,
617,0.97,7034.093,7059.085,"As currently funded I don't believe that would fall into the Fund, so either carve out these jump start funds and fill it with something else or not provide the funds, something along those lines.",96,,
618,0.97,7059.085,7061.921,Let's go to the next slide.,96,,
619,0.97,7061.921,7075.001,"On the left, what you see is just a chart detailing the amount of money that is proposed in the 2022 budget for the Kchra funding.",96,,
620,0.97,7075.001,7078.771,"2.7 across our more typical sources, especially general fund.",96,,
621,0.97,7078.771,7083.242,You can see that there is $1.1 million in Arpa.,96,,
622,0.97,7083.242,7085.311,I'll get to in that a moment.,96,,
623,0.97,7085.311,7094.72,"Then the 811,000 I mentioned in the payroll tax funds, for $4.6 million.",96,,
624,0.97,7094.72,7105.565,$4.6 million is actually about 1.6 more than what was discussed as the authority presented to its implementation board and its governing committee over the spring and summer.,96,,
625,0.97,7105.565,7107.7,How much was anticipated was come to from Seattle.,96,,
626,0.97,7107.7,7111.304,At that point it was notably less money coming to them.,96,,
627,0.97,7111.304,7117.076,So this is a higher amount in the first place.,96,,
628,0.97,7117.076,7125.051,"And one Tbhoatable reason for that addition is the Arpa funds, or the Seattle rescue plan funds.",96,,
629,0.97,7125.051,7134.794,"That $1.1 million, that's the permissible Carve-Out of administrative funds from overall what Arpa has.",96,,
630,0.97,7134.794,7140.333,At the time when the staffing plan was prepared over the summer the authority was not aware of a variety of things.,96,,
631,0.97,7140.333,7151.077,One of the major ones being that it would be receiving tens of millions of dollars in these Arpa funds to administer an put out contracts.,96,,
632,0.97,7151.077,7170.229,"And so looking at the staff, which I'm going to get to in a moment, and other expenses, a fair amount of those would be related to the administration of services, and there would be more administration because of more money being given to them, and, therefore, carving that out.",96,,
633,0.97,7170.229,7183.042,"The request for $600,000 would take the city's total contribution to overall staff and overhead at the authority to $5.2 million, as you can see on the chart.",96,,
634,0.97,7183.042,7198.357,"And after working with Hsd, that basically Correlates with the amount that was spend in Hsd to manage homelessness services in Hsd in 2019 before we had the regional authority or the path.",96,,
635,0.97,7198.357,7203.362,So there is some parallel in that total amount of funding that's being requested there.,96,,
636,0.97,7203.362,7209.769,"So now we move to the next slide, or, sorry, the next chart on the right.",96,,
637,0.97,7209.769,7210.636,Not the next slide.,96,,
638,0.97,7210.636,7211.637,"Sorry, Patty.",96,,
639,0.97,7211.637,7215.641,The chart on the right there is showing you the total administrative funding.,96,,
640,0.97,7215.641,7232.158,"So not only is the overall amount that Seattle is contributing going up, fairly substantially, by more than a million dollars, the overall amount of money that the authority is getting is almost twice as much in terms of what is budgeted for administration and overhead.",96,,
641,0.97,7232.158,7250.776,"And a large chunk of that either comes from Seattle putting in more money or continuum of care funding that comes through the county, and that would also be going to add to the total amount of a little bit more than $10 million in resources for the authority.",96,,
642,0.97,7250.776,7270.896,"I'm breaking down for you in this chart, you can see over the summer when the plan was developed, with a lot of things not known, not knowing the number of contracts, not knowing about one-time Federal dollars, not knowing final amounts to be sent from the county and the city, the $5.1 million was the anticipated total administer and overhead at that time.",96,,
643,0.97,7270.896,7278.004,"Now we're looking at a total of $10.8 million, and you can see the breakdown there.",96,,
644,0.97,7278.004,7287.279,"Some key pieces actually really substantially overlap with those continuum of care administration dollars, the last two items, software contracts, things like that.",96,,
645,0.97,7287.279,7290.95,You can see the base staffing is almost the same.,96,,
646,0.97,7290.95,7335.928,"There's just about $1.1 million in New staffing, some of whom are anticipated when the staffing plan was shown over the summer we were explicitly told to anticipate that more staff welcome back added for an Ombuds to make sure the voices of people experiencing Hokelessness, that that welcome back added to if any additional funding was found, and also it increases staff for sub regional planning, which is another--both the Ombuds and the sub regional planning, two new functions that the authority is launching into that hadn't been previously performed, not to mention administering Arpa funds.",96,,
647,0.97,7335.928,7369.061,"Overall the decision before the Council is not only is the authority asking for $600,000 more to close the estimated gap between what is going to be their administrative costs and what they have as committed resources for that, but also some of the funding right now is coming from jump starts, another $800,000, and I think it's important to flag that although the Arpa money he is to some degree to administer Arpa funds, we would be hiring staff with one-time funds.",96,,
648,0.97,7369.061,7370.596,Those are important considerations for the Council.,96,,
649,0.97,7370.596,7375.634,And with that I alley take any questions.,96,,
650,0.97,7375.634,7380.139,"Thank you very much, Jeff.",97,,
651,0.97,7380.139,7380.639,Colleagues.,97,,
652,0.97,7380.639,7381.14,"Comments, questions.",97,,
653,0.97,7381.14,7381.807,"Councilmember Lewis, thank you.",97,,
654,0.97,7381.807,7392.351,"Hey, so, you know, just going through all of this, Jeff, I understand some of these unanticipated things that have come up and the world has just changed so much.",98,,
655,0.97,7392.351,7412.471,"You know, I think the King County regional homelessness authority has been a very big institutional victim of the Covid era in terms of kind of coming up in being in an era of transition and also an era of crisis.",98,,
656,0.97,7412.471,7415.441,So like I get it.,98,,
657,0.97,7415.441,7432.558,I think my ongoing principle here is I want to make sure that we continue to have some level of equity and parity with King county in how we fund a lot of the operations and overhead of the authority and maybe you can comment on that on kind of how that's looking with these requests.,98,,
658,0.97,7432.558,7474.867,"The other thing I would just flag is, I do think certain functions, like having an Ombud, are incredibly critical, I think especially as a city council where a big part of our job is oversight and accountability for executive agencies, making sure that there is an OM Bud function I think is just a general good government principle, especially in an area like this where there has historically been so many Stakeholders that want to provide some kind of meaningful feedback in making sure that that is going to a place and something is structurally happening to create a loop to drive changes.",98,,
659,0.97,7474.867,7480.072,I do want to give a Shout-Out for that Ombud function.,98,,
660,0.97,7480.072,7485.044,Maybe you could comment more broadly on the equity of funding these operations.,98,,
661,0.97,7485.044,7485.578,"Yeah, absolutely.",99,,
662,0.97,7485.578,7496.555,"So I think that it was clear from my remarks, and you can see on the table how Seattle's contribution is about $1.6 million more than what we thought last summer.",99,,
663,0.97,7496.555,7507.466,"The county's contribution, and to be fair, they're not in a budget cycle right now, but through the Coc, administrative dollars are putting about $1.8 million more in.",99,,
664,0.97,7507.466,7517.977,"That's why I was careful to note that the Hmis contract alone, that's the management Info system we use for all our services and the other overhead.",99,,
665,0.97,7517.977,7519.612,There's a clear parallel there.,99,,
666,0.97,7519.612,7525.518,Seems to me it adds more about what would move over and what have emerged.,99,,
667,0.97,7525.518,7528.687,"Oh, here's more money and here's what that goes towards.",99,,
668,0.97,7528.687,7546.305,"So there's not a separate ask for just general dollars, and you actually do not have information at this point--I should say I don't have final information on King County Arpa funds that would be given to the authority to administer.",99,,
669,0.97,7546.305,7556.515,"My understanding is at this time, it's not likely that the unit that they're acquiring, for example, will be immediately moved over to the authority.",99,,
670,0.97,7556.515,7568.994,"So when you think about earlier when I was talking about the downtown plan, I talked about 500 new units, or 500 new beds through their Covid money, then also nine new buildings with the housing dollars.",99,,
671,0.97,7568.994,7574.3,"I don't believe at this time that any of those, the operations for those are moving over.",99,,
672,0.97,7574.3,7576.335,I don't know that that's final.,99,,
673,0.97,7576.335,7579.371,I could have outdated information at this point.,99,,
674,0.97,7579.371,7586.578,But some of what is being provided by the city would be Arpa money corresponding with one-time funds.,99,,
675,0.97,7586.578,7595.754,It doesn't appear that the county is necessarily putting in one-time funds and administering staff.,99,,
676,0.97,7595.754,7597.456,I think that generally answers your question.,99,,
677,0.97,7597.456,7618.544,"The one last point I would maybe make, the authority is going to have the ability to do what it wants to with dollars, and in theory one could close this administration gap by taking money out of services somewhere.",99,,
678,0.97,7618.544,7620.446,"It's $600,000, over $104 million just from us.",99,,
679,0.97,7620.446,7629.888,But any reduction that you make--if I amount of reduction you make to the funding given to contracted providers right now in order to cover this means that you have cut services.,99,,
680,0.97,7629.888,7633.759,There would be a direct Trade- off with that kind of thing.,99,,
681,0.97,7633.759,7637.529,"So there's flexible, but there's a clear cost, too.",99,,
682,0.97,7637.529,7640.432,The process doesn't have this same cost does.,99,,
683,0.97,7640.432,7644.67,"That--is there any further detail, Councilmember Lewis?",99,,
684,0.97,7644.67,7647.606,That's good on my end.,100,,
685,0.97,7647.606,7648.073,"Thank you, Jeff.",100,,
686,0.97,7648.073,7652.711,Can I ask a little bit more about that?,101,,
687,0.97,7652.711,7656.081,Because I saw that reflect in the memo as well.,101,,
688,0.97,7656.081,7663.856,We have asked our departments to do a tremendous amount of Scaling back and Reprioritizing in the wake of Covid.,101,,
689,0.97,7663.856,7667.526,And we've also asked the same of human service providers.,101,,
690,0.97,7667.526,7705.064,"And especially when it comes to human service provider contracts that we have we recognize that they have continued to tell us that when we haven't funded them at the appropriate levels, the consequence is not in terms of services, right, they've been very clear that the way that that's actually filtered out is administrative costs, which we have been working on over the last few years to address at the root cause of that issue, and that's Underpayment for those providers.",101,,
691,0.97,7705.064,7708.2,And our community contracts.,101,,
692,0.97,7708.2,7711.937,Councilmember Herbold indicated that in work she's done.,101,,
693,0.97,7711.937,7727.786,"It does seem like with a now doubtful administrative cost for the Rha, a similar sort of request or ask of the Rha to Prioritize services is not out of align with what we've asked our community contracts for our departments here.",101,,
694,0.97,7727.786,7730.756,So I don't understand how that's a foregone conclusion K.,101,,
695,0.97,7730.756,7742.0,And isn't it true that there's also things about the budgeting strategies that we could use to Prioritize certain investments for services?,101,,
696,0.97,7742.0,7748.207,"I believe I follow the question, but if I don't get this exactly right, please help me to redirect.",102,,
697,0.97,7748.207,7765.624,I think that the point I was trying to make is that the intention right now of the authority is to take all contracts that Hsd has been managing at a certain dollar amount and continue those at that same dollar amount without changing the terms and Stipulations.,102,,
698,0.97,7765.624,7771.697,"I mean, there's more or less that's how the intention is supposed to work.",102,,
699,0.97,7771.697,7796.255,"So that finding $600,000 somewhere in a rather--more than $100 worth of funds, it certainly might be possible, but just that would likely mean that in some way, shape, or form, less money was given to a contract somewhere, and I think that your point on that is that we're not necessarily talking about that a shelter is going to have fewer beds.",102,,
700,0.97,7796.255,7806.298,"We might be talking about that we're not going to pay staff the same level, which we are seeing have impacts on turnover, retention, even the ability to hire them in the first place.",102,,
701,0.97,7806.298,7811.703,"So I think that was the direction that you were asking about, Councilmember, but please correct me.",102,,
702,0.97,7811.703,7812.938,"Well, slightly different.",103,,
703,0.97,7812.938,7840.499,"If the overhead cost, if the administrative cost that the regional homelessness authority is, I think you said twice as much as originally anticipated, but the contract that we have are critical a year over year to make sure that those human service providers know how much they are receiving, it feels like we're saying the priority is going to be this now double administrative cost of the R H a versus Prioritizing the funding that we had anticipated would be going out the door in 2022.",103,,
704,0.97,7840.499,7851.243,That doesn't feel like a fair statement to make preemptive to our budget discussions about where we think administrative costs that we can contribute to as a city will go.,103,,
705,0.97,7851.243,7857.95,It is already providing a Trade- off between the human service contracts and the services they deliver versus the administrative costs.,103,,
706,0.97,7857.95,7877.135,That's why I'm saying it doesn't necessarily feel like it's a predetermined answer that the cuts or any reductions necessary wool come out of services when the administrative cost was double what the board and the Council and the community was briefed on early this year.,103,,
707,0.97,7877.135,7878.203,"Yeah, absolutely.",104,,
708,0.97,7878.203,7898.857,"The authority has put forward a $10.8 million operational plan for itself, and the Council, as you're absolutely correct, could say, Oh, we're not funding the amount that's been proposed, or they request an increase, or something along those lines, and the authority would have to find a way to operate within that different funding level.",104,,
709,0.97,7898.857,7906.965,"And there's--I hope I did a decent job of outline wring some of the proposed additions have gone, especially the staff piece have.",104,,
710,0.97,7906.965,7921.88,"There's some things like H IMS, you're kind of stuck object that, but there's definitely places that they would then to have make decisions about what would need to be cut or where work load or duties would have to be changed, things like that.",104,,
711,0.97,7921.88,7922.481,"Okay, thanks.",105,,
712,0.97,7922.481,7933.659,So similarly I'd be interested in some follow-up information on what the approval process is for the Rha for the recommendations coming to city council at this point.,105,,
713,0.97,7933.659,7970.595,"I know that we wouldn't sort of even have such a scarcity approach if we had more entities, more jurisdictions in our region contributing to this critical asset, the regional homelessness authority is doing just that, providing care across the region, and we hope, as the entity continues to get scaled up, that we'll have additional partners contributing in and look forward to learning more about the partnership and the dollar amount that you mention you are going to be seeking on the King County investment side to see when the universe of funding is available and would the final ask would be of city council at this point.",105,,
714,0.97,7970.595,7981.139,Let's move on to the last item.,105,,
715,0.97,7981.707,7989.047,"Council members, moving to the final issue, issue number 4, related to clean city initiative funding.",106,,
716,0.97,7989.047,8003.161,"Just remind Council you carved out funding to support the clean city initiative that provided a temporary surge to address illegal dumping and trash in the public Right-Of- ways, parks, open space, and around Encampments.",106,,
717,0.97,8003.161,8010.068,These efforts are primarily staffed by teams of employees from the parks Department and Seattle Department of transportation.,106,,
718,0.97,8010.068,8025.684,Table 6 on page 13 of your memo shows the funding included in the 2021 built in as well as additional appropriation that the Council made in April 2021 to continue this initiative through the end of 202 1. and in the proposed funding for 2022.,106,,
719,0.97,8025.684,8037.963,As you can see the executive would propose $6.2 million of one-time Coronavirus local fiscal recovery funds be used to support the clean city initiative through August 2022.,106,,
720,0.97,8037.963,8040.799,The initiative would end in August without additional funding.,106,,
721,0.97,8040.799,8052.677,"So your options are to extend the surge activities for four additional months to provide service for the entirety of 2022 at a cost of just over $3 million, or to adopt the Mayor's budget as proposed.",106,,
722,0.97,8052.677,8053.979,Thank you.,107,,
723,0.97,8053.979,8072.197,"And I'm going to--I believe Councilmember Peterson, with apologies to counsel Krill member Juarez.",107,,
724,0.97,8072.197,8077.202,Joint interest in clean city initiative.,107,,
725,0.97,8077.202,8079.137,"Thank you, chair Mosqueda.",108,,
726,0.97,8079.137,8090.248,I think that--I know that there's likely gone to be support for option a to extend these activities for--just to make it for the full year.,108,,
727,0.97,8090.248,8103.295,"Currently it would be turned proposal ending in August, and so just extending it for the full year may make more sense, and that can always be adjusted in a midyear supplemental discussion.",108,,
728,0.97,8103.295,8110.268,But setting aside those funds to extend it for the full year is something that I would hope would have support.,108,,
729,0.97,8110.268,8111.269,Thank you.,108,,
730,0.97,8111.269,8111.67,Appreciate it.,109,,
731,0.97,8111.67,8113.038,Thank you very much.,109,,
732,0.97,8113.038,8121.58,"And I think the $3.1 million, I just had a quick question about that, I believe that's sufficient to support existing services.",109,,
733,0.97,8121.58,8138.096,Do we know anything else about how much it may cost to scale up the frequency of which we can expect the purple bag program to visit Unsanctioned Encampments along with Rv?,109,,
734,0.97,8138.096,8140.765,I know Councilmember Herbold has been doing some work on.,109,,
735,0.97,8140.765,8148.64,This we are anxious to see the Rv purple bag program begin to receive additional support in quarter four.,109,,
736,0.97,8148.64,8155.914,I'm wondering this $3.1 provides the full amount necessary to scale up the services for Rv trash removal.,109,,
737,0.97,8155.914,8160.685,I'm going to hope that my colleague Brian goodnight can answer that question.,110,,
738,0.97,8160.685,8163.121,I don't think the purple bag--I think that is separate.,110,,
739,0.97,8163.121,8170.228,I'm hoping he is on the line and can answer that question.,110,,
740,0.97,8170.228,8172.697,"Thank you, Councilmember Mosqueda and Traci.",111,,
741,0.97,8172.697,8174.733,Purple bags are not included in the funding.,111,,
742,0.97,8174.733,8179.004,It's a little bit of surge support for the parks and the clean teams.,111,,
743,0.97,8179.004,8185.61,"It's a little more for graffiti control, litter abatement and Sharps collection.",111,,
744,0.97,8185.61,8190.181,Those are the four programs in SPD that are funded.,111,,
745,0.97,8190.181,8191.616,Complimentary program.,112,,
746,0.97,8191.616,8193.018,Then the purple bag program I did see.,112,,
747,0.97,8193.018,8199.724,Do you have any updates on whether or not that includes the additional support that we're hoping to see for Rvs?,112,,
748,0.97,8199.724,8213.071,"I guess I'm not sure about--in the Mayor's proposed budget, part of that said 556,000 for Rv remediation is to serve seven to 10 Rv sites with the purple bag program.",113,,
749,0.97,8213.071,8215.707,That is in the proposed program.,113,,
750,0.97,8215.707,8216.775,If that's what you're indicating.,113,,
751,0.97,8216.775,8223.682,The purple bag program generally is also expected to increase its service in 2022 from about 32 sites a month to 42 sites a month.,113,,
752,0.97,8223.682,8230.388,So both of those things are included in the '22 proposed budget.,113,,
753,0.97,8230.388,8231.456,Okay.,114,,
754,0.97,8231.456,8232.09,Wulff.,114,,
755,0.97,8232.09,8250.375,"So in addition to support for the clean cities initiative that you just heard, I might be interested in hearing a little bit more about how to scale up the purple bag program and if there's capacity to do that with our teams at parks and Rec.",114,,
756,0.97,8250.375,8255.313,"Anything else, Councilmember Pedersen that you would like to share?",114,,
757,0.97,8255.313,8256.247,Any additional comments this wonderful.,114,,
758,0.97,8256.247,8262.654,"Well, I will pass on one comment that Councilmember Juarez and I were talking about as well.",114,,
759,0.97,8262.654,8272.964,"I think your comments are well received, Councilmember Pedersen, and Councilmember Juarez noted we're past the point of a summer.",114,,
760,0.97,8272.964,8278.103,We'll look forward to hearing more about those proposals on the clean city initiative.,114,,
761,0.97,8278.103,8284.609,"With that, colleagues, I think we're at the end of the four issues that have been identified.",114,,
762,0.97,8284.609,8289.347,Are there any additional comments for the good of the order today?,114,,
763,0.97,8289.347,8291.75,I'm not seeing anybody pop tin screen here.,114,,
764,0.97,8291.75,8300.358,So we will go ahead and just let you go with a few extra minutes in today's agenda.,114,,
765,0.97,8300.358,8302.327,We will reconvene tomorrow morning at 9:30 A.M.,114,,
766,0.97,8302.327,8316.908,"We're going to have a chance to follow up on the community safety initiatives and Seattle police Department in the afternoon, and we'll make sure to get you the full hour recess as well, and that will conclude our three days of issue identification.",114,,
767,0.97,8316.908,8318.943,Thanks so much for being here with us tonight.,114,,
768,0.97,8318.943,8324.182,"Have a wonderful night, and hope you get a lot of rest so we can end with a bang.",114,,
769,0.97,8324.182,8325.45,See you tomorrow.,114,,
770,0.97,8325.45,8329.287,Thank you.,115,,
771,0.97,8329.287,8332.957,Bye-Bye.,115,,
