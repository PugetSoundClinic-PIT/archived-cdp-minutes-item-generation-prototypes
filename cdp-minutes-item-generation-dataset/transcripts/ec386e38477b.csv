13,0.97,68.201,77.61,"For the most part, in my view, these are set up to help the political establishment.",5,,
14,0.97,77.61,93.293,"As a Councilmember, as many of you may have is observed, I generally follow these protocols and conventions, but not when they are used by the political establishment as a lever to try to hinder ordinary people and grassroots movements as they are in this case with all Councilmembers boycotting this Committee.",5,,
15,0.97,93.293,104.637,We do have more than a Quorum of workers prepared to speak on the agenda items.,5,,
16,0.97,104.637,113.947,"To me, as a representative of working people, and not be political establishment, that is far more important.",5,,
17,0.97,113.947,129.162,"It is unfortunate, but not surprising that the political establishment is choosing to boycott any and all discussion about taxing big business to address the triple emergency of Covid housing and climate change.",5,,
18,0.97,129.162,156.389,"However, as I said, there is no law in continuing this committee meeting without other Councilmembers present, so we will not allow the big business loyalty boycott to prevent this discussion of workers, and I am very excited about tonight's committee as the next step in our movement, not only for the Amazon tax, but also to build Renter power to fight against what could be a massive wave of Evictions in the face of the historic joblessness in our society.",5,,
19,0.97,156.389,168.902,"Since 2017, we have been led by working people and community members, and they have been fighting for the Amazon tax to advance green new deal programs.",5,,

23,0.97,213.546,239.672,"But, before the first meeting, before the current meeting scheduled for May 13, the establishment led by Councilmembers Gonzales and Colbert said that to fund Covid relief green new deal somehow mysteriously was not emergency legislation responding to the Covid crisis.",5,,
24,0.97,239.672,247.38,"Imagine this, and emergency legislation to deal with the emergency emergency related, you cannot make this stuff up.",5,,

28,0.97,288.821,302.035,I held a conference with one of the attorneys who worked alongside the movement for the Seatac $15 minimum wage to explain why there is no defensible legal rationale for shutting down the hearings on tax Amazon.,5,,
29,0.97,302.035,306.539,Let's be very clear here.,5,,
30,0.97,306.539,321.154,"The Democratic party political establishment is trying to use the cover of legal arguments, and not very confident ones at that, to try to squash the movement and a growing movement, and protect big business from taxation.",5,,

189,0.97,1736.868,1737.736,Okay.,29,,
190,0.97,1737.736,1760.792,"Thank you Councilmember Sawant, at your request we put together information to demonstrate the number of jobs that could be supported by the proposed investments in social housing and green new deal strategies to describe the Council bill, CB 119774, that accompanies the proposed payroll tax.",29,,
191,0.97,1760.792,1767.832,Before we present that information we want to highlight a few of the Caveats to be aware of when using this information.,29,,
192,0.97,1767.832,1777.275,"Following that, we will have key terms and estimates for the two categories of spending.",29,,
193,0.97,1777.275,1783.648,Estimates we will present tonight were developed using a number of sources that employ different Methodologies to estimate jobs supported by the proposed investments.,29,,
194,0.97,1783.648,1798.096,This is just one approach to roughly estimate jobs that could be supported and is based on a number of assumptions.,29,,
195,0.97,1798.096,1802.567,"The actual number of jobs as you noted, created or supported, may be higher or lower than what is described here.",29,,
196,0.97,1802.567,1808.239,"As an example, the estimates assume that the amount of revenue that will be generated by the proposed payroll tax will bring in approximately $500 million annually.",29,,
197,0.97,1808.239,1813.511,"With about $370 million invested in the social housing, and about 120 million invested in green new deal investments annually.",29,,
198,0.97,1813.511,1825.256,"If those estimates of the revenue generated from the tax are higher or lower than what actually comes in, the job estimates would also change.",29,,
199,0.97,1825.256,1839.637,"Further, the estimates do not account for jobs that may be lost because of changes in an industry resulting from these policy changes or the Resection Ãreductions in jobs.",29,,
200,0.97,1839.637,1840.071,Sorry.,29,,
201,0.97,1840.071,1846.377,"So, before moving into the estimates we wanted to highlight these key terms that we might reference the presentation.",29,,
202,0.97,1846.377,1870.368,"Job estimates can be measured as direct, those jobs supported by the project itself, and Rec, those jobs supported in supplying the inputs to the project, or reduced, those job supporting goods and services to those people in jobs supported directly and indirectly by the investments.",29,,
203,0.97,1870.368,1874.672,"Some of the estimates provided tonight include just direct jobs, while others include a combination of direct, indirect, and induced jobs.",29,,
204,0.97,1874.672,1878.71,I also want to emphasize why we are using the term jobs recorded versus created.,29,,
205,0.97,1878.71,1894.726,"We use this for the construction related investments because the investments may provide ongoing work for an existing worker rather than providing a new job a person or a person not currently working, or not currently working in that industry.",29,,
206,0.97,1894.726,1902.934,"This is particularly applicable in an economic downturn were the only working construction or the majority of work in construction, for existing workers, maybe those projects are supported by these Public- sector investments.",29,,
207,0.97,1903.167,1914.045,"With that, I will turn it over to Tracy, who will describe the assumptions and estimates from the social housing investments.",29,,
208,0.97,1914.045,1919.15,"Thanks, Holly, some of you to slide three, and the assumptions and information that underpin the job estimates for the social housing investment.",30,,
209,0.97,1919.15,1930.528,"First as Allie mentioned, the job estimates are based on specific proposals regarding the number, types of housing.",30,,
210,0.97,1930.528,1942.273,"The specific job estimates for new construction housing developments were based on the April 2015 national cessation of homebuilders report, that showed each newly constructed 100 unit multifamily building supports 90 direct and indirect jobs, and 70 induced jobs.",30,,
211,0.97,1942.273,1954.085,"The specific job estimates for ongoing staffing for new permanent supported housing projects are based on the city's experience with such projects, which showed on average it takes 20 staff to support the ongoing operations and services of the properties.",30,,
212,0.97,1954.085,1962.593,Staffing can be less or more depending on the level of services that are provided at such projects.,30,,
213,0.97,1962.593,1984.315,"Looking at the table on the slide 4, we see the spending plan is at about 500 units of affordable housing funded in the first five years of the tax, and an additional 3100 units funded by your 10 for a total of 6600 units by the end of 10 years.",30,,
214,0.97,1984.315,1991.856,"We estimate these units will support 3150 direct and indirect jobs by the end of five years, and 2790 additional jobs by year 10 for a total of 5940 jobs by the end of 10 years.",30,,
215,0.97,1994.025,2011.142,"In addition, 2485 induced jobs will be supported by the end of five years, and an additional 2200 jobs will be created by the end of 10 years, for a total of 4686 induced jobs by the end of 10 years.",30,,
216,0.97,2011.142,2021.319,"Total in these altogether, direct, indirect, and induced jobs, we--we each reach a total of 5635 jobs supported and 10,626 in the first 10 years.",30,,
217,0.97,2021.319,2027.825,It should be noted that these units will be funded and constructed over a period of 10+ years.,30,,
218,0.97,2027.825,2041.239,"As it relates to the job estimates for new permanent supportive housing projects, the spending plan assumes that 1400 units of Psh will be funded in the first five years, and an additional 1300 units by year 10 for a total of 2700 Psh units.",30,,
219,0.97,2041.239,2048.079,"Assuming the average size of such project is 100 units, this equates to 14 new Psh buildings being funded during the first five years.",30,,
220,0.97,2048.079,2050.348,That will result in 280 direct jobs.,30,,
221,0.97,2050.348,2069.667,"By your 10, an additional 13 Psh projects will be funded, requiring an additional 260 direct jobs, for a total of 540 jobs in the first 10 years.",30,,
222,0.97,2069.667,2075.506,"Again, these Psh projects will be constructed and completed over a period of 10+ years in the job supporting these projects will happen over the same time period.",30,,
223,0.97,2075.506,2076.307,"Thanks, Tracy.",31,,
224,0.97,2076.307,2083.714,"So, now we will move to discuss the green new deal related investments and the job estimates supported by those investments.",31,,
225,0.97,2083.714,2090.788,"First, I will walk through some of the assumptions that estimates, and that I will present the numbers.",31,,
226,0.97,2090.788,2097.695,"There is no common methodology to estimate jobs that may be supported for these investments, which is why we have provided estimates using two different Methodologies.",31,,
227,0.97,2097.695,2109.874,"We first estimated the number of jobs that could be supported using a rule of thumb approach by using the industry that assumes that for every $1 million in energy efficiency investments, 17 jobs are supported.",31,,
228,0.97,2109.874,2114.345,The city also has a jobs tool that was created to simply project the number of local contractor jobs.,31,,
229,0.97,2114.345,2127.391,"Thus, this estimate is substantially lower, because it is really looking at a specific sector of direct employment that could be supported by these investments.",31,,
230,0.97,2127.391,2134.465,"It is also important to note that for this analysis, the green new deal investments were assumed to be entirely dedicated to converting homes from a fossil fuel based heat sources to electric heat pumps.",31,,
231,0.97,2134.465,2144.242,"However, the spending plan as currently drafted contemplates a broader range of investments that would be determined with input from the to be established green new deal oversight board.",31,,
232,0.97,2144.242,2146.611,Investments directed towards a different strategy may impact these estimates.,31,,
233,0.97,2151.883,2156.387,This slide presents an estimate of jobs calculated by the methods described.,31,,
234,0.97,2156.387,2168.366,"Using the rule of thumb method the number of jobs supported is estimated at about $11,000 in the first five years of the investments in about 22,000 over a 10 year horizon, that includes direct, indirect, and induced jobs.",31,,
235,0.97,2168.366,2178.543,"Using the jobs tool, the number of jobs supported is estimated to be about 2500 jobs in the first five years of the investments, and about 4400 jobs supported over a 10 year horizon.",31,,
236,0.97,2179.911,2193.724,"This final slide simply summarizes the estimates in the two spending categories that use similar approaches in terms of accounting for direct, indirect, and induced jobs.",31,,
237,0.97,2193.724,2209.607,"It does not include estimates that only look at direct jobs, because it is not similar data, so it is harder to summarize in one table.",31,,
238,0.97,2209.607,2211.042,That concludes the presentation we have prepared.,31,,
239,0.97,2211.042,2213.477,We are happy to answer any questions from the Councilmember.,31,,
240,0.97,2213.711,2215.713,Thank you so much.,32,,
241,0.97,2215.713,2221.953,"I don't have questions at this moment, because your slides were so clear.",32,,
242,0.97,2221.953,2257.288,"I really appreciate you also explaining why we are talking about jobs being supported and being so accurate in your presentation and also explaining the Caveats with the estimates, and I think if I was just a regular working person watching these slides I would be greatly empowered and have much more confidence in why the city council should be passing a progressive revenue source like the Amazon tax in order to fund jobs when joblessness is a key feature of this crisis.",32,,
243,0.97,2257.288,2279.076,"And I think the numbers they have presented really go to the heart of the matter that is being highlighted not just by Socialists like me, one of the most important things I . This week was the writings from the economist on the International Monetary Fund.",32,,
244,0.97,2279.076,2325.956,"They are a bastion of the capitalist class and even those economists are confronted with a bitter reality that the global economy, the global economy is faced with and they are forced to acknowledge that unless something dramatic is done, like a public works program that will create jobs, and build infrastructure like housing, unless something like that is done and we needed done on a big scale, there will, they say--not a Socialist, these economists are saying that there will be a permanent Scarring on the most vulnerable working people in our society, meaning, you know, there will be permanent job loss, and there will be just lasting effect of, you know, the lasting Impoverishment of a whole section of our society.",32,,
245,0.97,2325.956,2339.37,"And so, you know, on that note, I wanted to really think, not only Allie and Tracy about the strong, you know, estimates they have prepared through the painstaking research.",32,,
246,0.97,2339.37,2359.29,"But, also all of the other members of the central staff and the central staff director who have provided really excellent technical support for us and research support for us to bring this legislation to this kind of point where we are able to talk about it, but our next panel will illustrate what our next step is.",32,,
247,0.97,2359.29,2365.596,It is not going to be enough for us to have good numbers.,32,,
248,0.97,2365.596,2366.597,Even a very promising numbers.,32,,
249,0.97,2366.597,2373.904,"It is not going to be enough to have great ideas, just because this is a good idea, which is absolutely, it is.",32,,
250,0.97,2373.904,2376.173,It is not mean we are going to win it.,32,,
251,0.97,2376.173,2388.319,"Look at the obstacles the political establishment is putting in our path it is because big business, the Billionaires, the wealthy are absolutely not close to paying even a dime to address the cause of this crisis.",32,,
252,0.97,2388.319,2396.293,"And, that is why we are going to need working people to fight back, and in fact it is because of working people fighting back that we are even at this point.",32,,
253,0.97,2396.293,2405.236,"That is why we are fortunate to this evening to have with us a number of experts on the crisis facing working people, and what we will need to do to continue building our movement.",32,,
254,0.97,2405.236,2423.854,"They are experts because as rank and file workers in various areas they know and see every day how the Covid crisis is affecting workers in the community, and why the Amazon tax policy is the correct prescription for the crisis we face.",32,,
255,0.97,2423.854,2430.561,"We have a very large panel, we have I think eight people, and we are fortunate to have them.",32,,
256,0.97,2430.561,2441.572,"But, so that we have time to hear from all of them, and have a little bit of discussion and because we have to go to the second agenda point as well, I have asked them to speak intern for 2-3 minutes.",32,,
257,0.97,2441.572,2451.482,"I want to introduce Molly Whitaker, a rank-and-file member of 242.",32,,
258,0.97,2451.482,2453.551,"Thank you so much, Molly, for joining us tonight.",32,,
259,0.97,2453.551,2455.186,"And, happy birthday.",32,,
260,0.97,2455.186,2461.058,"We recognize that you have to leave early for a birthday celebration, but we appreciate you making part of the birthday to testify in this important discussion.",32,,

265,0.97,2476.707,2483.214,I'm speaking in favor of the tax today and I want to emphasize the importance of creating Union jobs.,33,,
266,0.97,2483.214,2486.15,Four over four decades now there has been a deepening of class stratification.,33,,
267,0.97,2486.15,2490.921,The rich are richer and the poor are poor.,33,,
268,0.97,2490.921,2499.63,A Union career in the building trades is one of the remaining paths the working class people have to attaining a decent standard of living.,33,,
269,0.97,2499.63,2508.606,"These jobs provide opportunities for those who may be never had access to high- quality education, or those who want to turn their lives around despite having a past criminal record.",33,,
270,0.97,2508.606,2512.643,Providing these opportunities is essential to the overall health of society.,33,,
271,0.97,2512.643,2518.549,"It is very important that this gets on the ballot this season, especially in light of the economic uncertainty we are facing today.",33,,
272,0.97,2518.549,2519.984,Thank you for your time.,33,,
273,0.97,2522.152,2523.654,"Thank you very much, Molly.",34,,
274,0.97,2523.988,2532.596,"Next, I would like to introduce Colin Boone, who is a Rank-And- file member of the National brotherhood of electrical workers 46 local.",34,,

279,0.97,2544.775,2547.811,I just want to speak personally about why this is so important.,37,,
280,0.97,2547.811,2576.206,"Basically, in my Union we are always keeping an eye on the economy as it relates to new construction projects and it is common knowledge that no building boom lasts forever and any one of my coworkers was around during the 2008 financial crisis has 1 million stories about how bad things can get during a recession, whether there are no jobs available, unemployment starts to run out.",37,,
281,0.97,2576.206,2577.875,People lose their homes.,37,,
282,0.97,2577.875,2599.997,"And, so right now as we are dealing with both a massive public health crisis, but also entering into what could be one of the worst economic downturns since the 1930s, this question of providing safe and good paying Union jobs is going to be a crucial one.",37,,
283,0.97,2599.997,2617.047,"And that is why I think it is important that this legislation, in addition to providing the immediate relief for people during Covid-19, is also going to create and preserve tens of thousands of jobs, including many Union construction jobs through building public housing and retrofitting as was mentioned.",37,,
284,0.97,2617.047,2629.259,"And, having consistent jobs like this, that are recession proof, where union members can count on them being there every year would be an absolute lifeline during tough economic times.",37,,
285,0.97,2629.259,2642.072,"And we know we cannot rely on Amazon or Boeing or any other large corporation to bend over backwards to make sure that we have work as construction workers, particularly during a recession.",37,,
286,0.97,2642.072,2654.652,"The number one motive is going to be preserving profits above everything else and if that means laying off workers or canceling or delaying construction projects, they're going to do that.",37,,
287,0.97,2654.652,2665.796,And that is also why working people and union members are going to have to fight like Hail to get this tax passed because big business will fight this every step of the way.,37,,
288,0.97,2665.796,2677.408,You have already seen their representatives in the Seattle times trying to tackle this left and right so we will have to fight just as hard to get it past.,37,,
289,0.97,2677.408,2689.286,"Unfortunately, it appears that many of the city council would rather see austerity budgets past and cuts to social services rather than actually standing up to big business and enforcing what is really a modest tax.",37,,
290,0.97,2689.286,2709.506,"And, it is also in my opinion really shameful that we see other Councilmembers use Legalistic excuses to avoid passing the tax and not coming to this Meeting.But, I would like to thank Councilmember Sawant for continuing to make this for working people who insist on being heard.",37,,
291,0.97,2709.506,2721.919,"Next, would like to introduce Logan swan, Rank-And- file member of Ironworkers 86, Logan and his coworkers do the structural steel installation and the High-Rises we see all over downtown.",38,,

297,0.97,2752.349,2757.788,This is not by accident.,39,,
298,0.97,2757.788,2767.197,This is unfair and unsustainable and it has been consciously constructed by big business and they have fought working people like us tooth and nail to keep us picking up their tab.,39,,
299,0.97,2767.197,2773.47,The business developer and corporate landlord lobby bitterly fought tax Amazon in 2018.,39,,
300,0.97,2773.47,2776.707,They spent millions last year trying to buy City Hall.,39,,
301,0.97,2776.707,2789.386,They're doing everything they can now to undermine our movement today with assistance provided from Councilmembers who are refusing to discuss our needs.,39,,
302,0.97,2789.386,2799.296,"The political establishment, with the backing of the employers, promise action and alternatives in a cynical attempt to nullify us, they had a 10 year plan to end homelessness but every year we sought get worse.",39,,
303,0.97,2799.296,2801.131,They talk a lot about a regional approach.,39,,
304,0.97,2801.131,2810.841,"But, what we have seen is that these only surface in terms of mobilization and are dropped just as quickly if they succeed in undercutting them.",39,,
305,0.97,2810.841,2826.657,What came of the regional approach that Jenny Durkan mentioned in 2013 when the Mayor and the majority of city council repealed the tax on big business?,39,,
306,0.97,2826.657,2828.926,Cast aside once the objective of protecting the wealthy was achieved.,39,,
307,0.97,2828.926,2835.432,"We saw in response to the movement earlier this year they were willing to Revisit this, but conceiving only a fraction of what we need while banning any future taxation.",39,,
308,0.97,2835.432,2848.846,"These elected officials are quick to wax progressive in words, but refusing to sit down with us and refusing to hold meetings on our needs, our action conferences are open to everyone who supports what we need.",39,,

311,0.97,2864.261,2872.002,"The same Council members absent today will not interact with people in a meaningful way on our terms, right?",39,,
312,0.97,2872.002,2878.108,They told us that a $15 minimum wage was too much.,39,,
313,0.97,2878.108,2881.111,Can we compromise?,39,,
314,0.97,2881.111,2882.312,15 will destroy the economy.,39,,
315,0.97,2882.312,2891.321,"We were told earlier this year that a winter moratorium on Addictions could put the city at risk of litigation, which sounds familiar right now, right?",39,,
316,0.97,2891.321,2904.334,"Now, Councilmembers are Questionably citing the open public meetings to say discussing this emergency measure would present a legal risk but that is not Presentã stop them from repealing the victory and taxing big business.",39,,
317,0.97,2909.74,2911.808,This working people's campaign is a continuation of that fight.,39,,
318,0.97,2911.808,2919.316,The scale of need is only continuing to rise as the political establishment has failed to address that all the wealth we create goes to the top.,39,,

330,0.97,2990.087,3035.332,"Before I introduce the other experts I had two questions that I need to ask the trade speakers, the trade workers who are with us, CALI and Logan .1 question I had was what are the experiences that you hear from you know, not only from your own lives, but from your coworkers in terms of the commutes they face, and you know, you or, you and your coworkers are workers who build the buildings and build our infrastructure, but what is your assessment of what proportion of the workers who actually build all of this infrastructure are actually able to live in the city, and do you hear from your coworkers that it should be different and that all workers who work in the city to make the city run should also get to live here?",40,,
331,0.97,3035.332,3040.203,"Logan, if you want to start and then Colin and Molly if she is still available.",40,,
332,0.97,3042.305,3044.641,"Yeah, can you hear me?",41,,
333,0.97,3044.641,3045.275,Yeah.,42,,
334,0.97,3045.275,3062.692,"Yeah, I mean my commute--when I'm working in Seattle, which has been the past several years, usually that is the closest commute I can get is driving to Seattle and it is anywhere from an hour to two hours a day in traffic.",43,,
335,0.97,3062.692,3073.503,"And then, I am considered really fortunate most of the guys on the job site that I am on are commuting from Tacoma, as far down South as lacey, from Everett.",43,,
336,0.97,3073.503,3076.106,It is not Bonney Lake.,43,,

338,0.97,3087.918,3094.691,"And, that is you know, some people, that has the areas they grew up in and they want to stay there but you know, I mean, we don't really have a choice.",43,,
339,0.97,3094.691,3097.427,We cannot afford to have a home in Seattle.,43,,

344,0.97,3109.84,3118.048,"I have about a 45 minute commute and I'm considered very fortunate and as Logan said, most of my coworkers have several hour-long commutes.",45,,
345,0.97,3118.048,3134.631,Also know very few people in my job site who actually live in Seattle and just kind of like general knowledge is like Seattle is too expensive.,45,,

347,0.97,3144.574,3155.785,And then you have this public transit that is not good enough to get to various job sites on short notice so commutes are kind of part of the thing.,45,,

349,0.97,3162.259,3165.328,We are going to take advantage of that and have you also respond.,46,,

355,0.97,3192.522,3197.027,Traffic is a big topic of conversation on the job site all the time.,47,,
356,0.97,3202.232,3203.5,Right.,48,,
357,0.97,3203.5,3207.737,"And, before you leave, I have another question for all three of you but we will start with Molly this time.",48,,
358,0.97,3207.737,3223.153,"Two years ago, some of the leaders of some of the building trades unions oppose the Amazon tax because they said that according to them workers needed to align with big business to protect jobs because otherwise we would lose jobs according to them.",48,,
359,0.97,3223.153,3232.329,And a quote from one of those leaders it was we feel like a local politician should be facilitating business in the city.,48,,
360,0.97,3232.329,3238.635,"I believe all three of you were part of the Amazon tax movement last time, two years ago?",48,,
361,0.97,3238.635,3244.741,"How do you respond to this, and what are you hearing from your coworkers know versus two years ago?",48,,
362,0.97,3244.741,3245.575,Are you observing a change?,48,,
363,0.97,3245.575,3261.825,"And, how do you think, you your self, as a union member, a rank and file construction trades worker, how do you go about building unity among Rank-And- file workers to fight for a society that is affordable for those of us who are building it.",48,,
364,0.97,3262.092,3262.993,It is very disappointing.,49,,
365,0.97,3262.993,3278.008,I definitely feel like my Union local it was not really fighting for the working class at all by being so opposed to the head tax.,49,,
366,0.97,3278.008,3279.275,I remember two years ago.,49,,
367,0.97,3279.275,3282.312,I remember some people being pretty against it.,49,,
368,0.97,3282.312,3289.419,But then most of them I could sit down and talk to you and share my opinion and they would say I suppose that makes sense.,49,,
369,0.97,3289.419,3294.891,"So, it is just a matter of with the media that people are presented with.",49,,
370,0.97,3294.891,3301.831,They don't hear our side of it.,49,,
371,0.97,3301.831,3309.739,I have not heard a lot of discussion lately on the job site.,49,,
372,0.97,3309.739,3326.756,Sometimes we get posters from Socialist alternative getting posted on the polls sometimes and it is they get torn down but I don't know if it is the actual guys on my job site doing that or not.,49,,
373,0.97,3326.756,3329.459,"Yeah, I think that is all that I have to say.",49,,
374,0.97,3329.693,3334.864,Thank you.,50,,
375,0.97,3334.864,3353.316,"And, Colin and Logan, do you want to add your thoughts and I think this is a very important discussion and I appreciate Molly weighing in on this also because, you know, we are not always going to automatically start with everybody agreeing on everything, so building unified movements where we can come together around common ideas, common values,, demands.",50,,
376,0.97,3375.605,3404.434,"So I started working at my current job after the first tax Amazon fight ended, I definitely noticed that there is more openness to not being super friendly or Tankful to Amazon as a corporation . Before recently, I think part of that is seeing how ridiculously wealthy Jeff Bezos has gotten.",51,,
377,0.97,3404.434,3410.607,"And then also, Yeah, like there is obviously a lot of Trump supporters on the Jobsite.",51,,
378,0.97,3410.607,3418.548,You see pretty conservative things written in the Porta Potty.,51,,
379,0.97,3418.548,3427.824,I've had discussions with coworkers round Bernie Sanders and a lot of concerns about who is going to pay for this or that policy.,51,,

381,0.97,3438.868,3440.17,That's all I've got.,51,,
382,0.97,3440.17,3443.94,Great.,52,,
383,0.97,3443.94,3445.742,"Logan, if you can add your thoughts as well.",52,,
384,0.97,3445.742,3448.545,You were definitely in the thick of it two years ago also.,52,,
385,0.97,3448.545,3469.666,"I think, Collin made a good point, what we might have our fellow workers with very different political ideologies, even sometimes quite different, and yet, we can actually win our fellow workers over when we talk about our shared interest is a working-class.",52,,
386,0.97,3469.666,3483.313,"And specifically, can you address, obviously, and I speak as a rank-and-file labor union member myself, we don't take it lightly when Amazon tries to take away jobs.",52,,
387,0.97,3483.313,3484.881,We don't take that lightly.,52,,
388,0.97,3484.881,3496.125,"We absolutely feel solidarity with construction workers who might feel threatened that their jobs are going to be lost, absolutely.",52,,
389,0.97,3496.125,3498.328,I think we have to stand shoulder to shoulder with them.,52,,
390,0.97,3498.328,3508.738,But how do we explained actually their interests are tied with other workers were not in the trades and Working- class people as a whole whether unionized or not and not with Amazon.,52,,
391,0.97,3508.738,3518.448,"Yeah, so, I fully supported the tax Amazon campaign in 2018.",53,,
392,0.97,3518.448,3531.427,"And, following that, unfortunately my Union leadership cited with Amazon in that.",53,,
393,0.97,3531.427,3545.475,"My experience on the Jobsite, I would talk to, I remember after the infamous West conference the Crane operator on my Jobsite said, I saw you at that thing, that's awesome.",53,,

397,0.97,3560.89,3561.557,I support tax Amazon.,53,,
398,0.97,3561.557,3562.959,"And he looks at me, why?",53,,
399,0.97,3562.959,3570.9,And I explained how it's a race to the bottom if we accept the bullying from these companies.,53,,
400,0.97,3570.9,3573.369,How Amazon has $4.5 billion invested in their campus in Seattle.,53,,
401,0.97,3573.369,3584.347,And I think it's really important to correct the record on the idea that if we just give as many breaks as possible and ease the load on big business that workers will benefit.,53,,
402,0.97,3584.347,3587.317,That is Trickle-Down economics.,53,,

416,0.97,3654.15,3655.985,Media big business doesn't say that.,53,,
417,0.97,3655.985,3661.324,Unfortunately we weren't having discussion on that basis in the labor movement.,53,,

429,0.97,3727.924,3732.361,That is hospitals for people who need care.,53,,
430,0.97,3732.361,3734.363,All of those things should be available to people.,53,,
431,0.97,3734.363,3737.767,That means we have to do them on the basis of for people and Not-For-Profit.,53,,
432,0.97,3737.767,3744.74,This legislation is addressing that.,53,,
433,0.97,3744.74,3756.753,"And in the process of building the infrastructure it's going to be the difference between what we saw last time where it was one third of construction workers were unemployed, it doesn't have to be like that.",53,,

438,0.97,3781.711,3800.396,"And suddenly, aspiring example of how we're not going to build a strong movement by being with only a few of us who agree with each other, we have to do the hard task of discussing and debating in open and respectful as Logan said, and open and respectful way.",54,,

494,0.97,4178.807,4182.378,Campus employees were told we couldn't have Ppe or Disinfectants because everything had to go to the hospitals.,61,,
495,0.97,4182.378,4187.65,For a while there weren't enough masks at the hospital so workers were bringing in masks from home.,61,,

498,0.97,4208.504,4210.339,Now they are handing out one mask per day.,61,,
499,0.97,4210.339,4217.613,"The issue with that is, like our custodians who have to clean out patient rooms, Covid rooms, infectious rooms, they are used to changing their mask and Ppe every time they finish cleaning a room.",61,,

504,0.97,4243.439,4247.276,"They said it was ineffectual even though grocery stores and hardware stores, gas stations, they all have Plexiglass barriers.",61,,

506,0.97,4257.653,4259.888,They stayed up for two days before management figured it out.,61,,
507,0.97,4259.888,4268.397,They took them down and they told us how embarrassed they were that we would do such a thing.,61,,
508,0.97,4268.397,4268.998,You know what?,61,,
509,0.97,4268.998,4271.1,We have a right to try to protect ourselves.,61,,

513,0.97,4299.695,4304.6,"We feel like the, telling us we are doing a valuable service and at the end, you know, we don't need you for a while.",61,,
514,0.97,4304.6,4312.041,This is all about Uw and their austerity measure.,61,,
515,0.97,4312.041,4318.113,They are doing this to try to save some money until the next Covid influx.,61,,
516,0.97,4318.113,4320.616,Austerity doesn't work.,61,,
517,0.97,4320.616,4326.755,Workers . We need more services.,61,,

520,0.97,4337.266,4347.242,I am asking the rest of the Councilmembers to please his support the tax Amazon.,61,,
521,0.97,4347.242,4361.457,"I want to ask one question of you, as you mentioned, austerity is, it's not on the horizon but it's already here for Uw workers.",62,,
522,0.97,4361.457,4391.32,"We know it's there for the field city of Seattle workers, and in Olympia,, Zoe and Paula, can you explain what are the discussions within your unions, within the rank-and-file and leadership about how to prepare your members to fight against this austerity and how the community at large can help you.",62,,
523,0.97,4391.32,4392.521,"Zoe, want to get started?",62,,
524,0.97,4392.521,4393.122,Short.,63,,
525,0.97,4393.122,4400.229,Unfortunately for a lot of our members they are feeling pretty Dejected right now.,63,,
526,0.97,4400.229,4405.534,"Our jobs are incredibly hard, residents work up to 80 hours per week and only get four days off per month.",63,,
527,0.97,4405.534,4438.233,"They are exhausted, they're doing extra shifts and I really agree with what Paula said how it's so ironic that we get a lot of High-Fives and parades and free food which is all great, but what we need is wellness in a real sense and what we need to be well actually is at the end of the day when you are so exhausted to not also be worried about paying for rent and Childcare and the fact that your spouse was laid off.",63,,
528,0.97,4438.233,4462.057,"And so I think a lot of our members are feeling really sick and tired of the way we are being treated, especially because we've been doing this negotiation for so long, even before Covid were not willing to pay us anywhere near what residents in other expensive cities like San Francisco, L.A., San Diego and New York are paid.",63,,
529,0.97,4462.057,4467.462,Now with Covid they have another excuse to continue not paying us anywhere near what they are paid.,63,,
530,0.97,4467.462,4471.633,We are a lot luckier than a lot of our other ethical staff we work with.,63,,
531,0.97,4471.633,4481.677,So it's also our job as physicians to echo the needs of other Uw upper campus and medical staff too.,63,,
532,0.97,4481.677,4494.223,I think some of us are getting some hope from doing that and being part of the movement and solidarity with everyone else I think it's really hard.,63,,
533,0.97,4494.223,4496.525,Paula?,64,,
534,0.97,4496.525,4502.13,Most of the unions blame doctor Ramsey for this situation they are in.,65,,
535,0.97,4502.13,4507.836,He claims they are $500 million in the hole.,65,,
536,0.97,4507.836,4513.242,He has done a lot of stuff over the last five or 10 years that has cost the hospital millions of dollars.,65,,
537,0.97,4513.242,4518.914,"He built a new tower that they realized, once a got ill, they couldn't feel.",65,,
538,0.97,4518.914,4521.25,They didn't need it.,65,,
539,0.97,4521.25,4526.154,And he is really at fault for what is happening.,65,,
540,0.97,4526.154,4535.797,"This is a public University, public hospitals, and the public needs to hold the Uw medical system accountable for the money they have been wasting.",65,,
541,0.97,4535.797,4546.475,"There wasting Medicare money, state money, and that's what we are going to be trying to do, ask questions about, when they spend money.",65,,
542,0.97,4546.475,4552.381,"And once again, that is what austerity is about.",65,,
543,0.97,4552.381,4554.616,Upper management makes mistakes and they want the workers to be Ford.,65,,
544,0.97,4554.616,4558.487,To make it better.,65,,
545,0.97,4558.487,4568.797,We are going to fight this we can't keep having to bear the brunt of every mistake they make.,65,,
546,0.97,4568.797,4569.798,Thank you so much.,66,,
547,0.97,4569.798,4585.681,"As Paula said, it's really, the austerity, it's not like an act of God, it's being carried out by the bureaucrats, the administration at the University of Washington and they are responsible for it.",66,,
548,0.97,4585.681,4593.422,"If there is any mismanagement of reserved cash, it is their fault.",66,,
549,0.97,4593.422,4595.824,And it should not be put on the backs of working people.,66,,
550,0.97,4595.824,4601.129,"Zoe, I really appreciate you being very sort of open about how there is a feeling of detection.",66,,
551,0.97,4601.129,4612.541,"I appreciate that being articulated because we know that as we head into the worst economic year of our lives, it is going to be a factor.",66,,
552,0.97,4612.541,4616.144,We have to support one another through this process.,66,,
553,0.97,4616.144,4626.254,And part of supporting is just acknowledging that we are feeling Dejected or demoralized or sad and that those are going to be real things among working people.,66,,
554,0.97,4626.254,4638.667,"And then as you also said, overcoming, becoming part of a movement you have solidarity and you offer solidarity and you get solidarity back.",66,,
555,0.97,4638.667,4648.644,"I really appreciate you sharing that because we have to make sure we are all human, and we have to build the movement acknowledging our own humanity.",66,,
556,0.97,4648.644,4662.457,"And, talking about how we can address this together, we now have matt who is an educator and rank-and-file member of the Seattle education Association.",66,,
557,0.97,4662.457,4665.594,Which I am proud to report has voted to endorse our tax Amazon campaign.,66,,

559,0.97,4666.495,4670.098,Thank you so much.,67,,
560,0.97,4670.098,4682.577,Thank you to Councilmember Sawant for hosting this and the other panelists on tonight as well as everyone tuning in from wherever you are.,67,,
561,0.97,4682.577,4690.919,"My name is matt, I am a Renter in D3 I live in the central district.",67,,
562,0.97,4690.919,4696.625,I am a substitute teacher who before the crisis was teaching music here in the central district.,67,,
563,0.97,4696.625,4698.226,I am no longer a substitute teacher.,67,,
564,0.97,4698.226,4709.237,And I am right now working as a residential painter and contractor because that's what I usually do during the summers.,67,,
565,0.97,4709.237,4728.657,Am a member of the Seattle education Association and as was mentioned we recently voted to endorse the Amazon tax movement specifically the Sawant Morales tax Amazon legislation including the funding for immediate cash in hand relief for Seattle families as well as funding for housing.,67,,
566,0.97,4728.657,4734.963,"There is an urgent need for students, families, educators, to fund housing.",67,,
567,0.97,4734.963,4763.625,"I think what the sisters and Brothers from the trades were speaking about earlier with commutes, it maybe isn't as exaggerated for educators but a lot of people will come in from need housing in the city in the neighborhoods where we live where we can teach.",67,,
568,0.97,4764.526,4766.728,As a substitute I work in a lot of different environments.,67,,
569,0.97,4766.728,4769.164,I get to know some schools quite well including some Studnts.,67,,
570,0.97,4769.164,4771.6,I just want to say housing and security doesn't always look the same.,67,,
571,0.97,4771.6,4778.673,"I know students personally who have been in situations where they have lost housing, they have been kicked out of their family homes because they came out with their true gender identity to their families.",67,,
572,0.97,4778.673,4785.814,"That is obviously a tragic situation and should not happen, young people should be housed.",67,,
573,0.97,4785.814,4790.218,And it's not always quite so stark or harsh.,67,,
574,0.97,4790.218,4794.756,"A lot of times it's families and students who are just traveling, staying on people's couches.",67,,
575,0.97,4794.756,4812.14,"That is a housing insecurity and can have a huge impact on the school, the ability of students to do school, to Engge in school.",67,,
576,0.97,4812.14,4822.617,"A lot of times, it's unfortunate, but the first conversation you sometimes have with students is not necessarily how is school, how is work?",67,,
577,0.97,4822.617,4823.952,But how is the housing situation?,67,,
578,0.97,4823.952,4825.954,A lot of huge questions facing our young people today.,67,,
579,0.97,4825.954,4835.73,And it's a shame that Councilmember Sawant is the only one here tonight.,67,,
580,0.97,4835.73,4839.968,"I am glad this meeting is being hosted and moving forward on this because students can't wait, families can't wait.",67,,
581,0.97,4839.968,4842.237,The realities of quarantine for educators and students is distance learning.,67,,
582,0.97,4842.237,4862.39,"It's maybe not fighting for Tpe or health and safety as might be happening in a lot of other workplaces where people are were on the call with me, but the question of how students learn when they are at home is a real one.",67,,
583,0.97,4862.39,4865.193,Especially as students don't have access to stable housing.,67,,
584,0.97,4865.193,4875.57,Or in particular access to affordable stable reliable Internet.,67,,
585,0.97,4875.57,4878.073,There is multiple emergency for families with millions applying for unemployment.,67,,
586,0.97,4878.073,4881.009,With others working from home.,67,,
587,0.97,4881.009,4888.283,"With the added expectation of not only performing Childcare for your family, but becoming home teachers as well.",67,,
588,0.97,4888.283,4893.822,Homeschooling your students.,67,,
589,0.97,4893.822,4897.525,"That is why I am here tonight, probably standing with my Union supporting the Amazon tax fight.",67,,
590,0.97,4897.525,4905.6,It's a modest tax on Seattle's biggest businesses and it will urgently find high-quality public housing and provide cash relief for families.,67,,
591,0.97,4905.6,4907.435,I don't think they should be separated.,67,,
592,0.97,4907.435,4922.05,"My Union voted to support both halves of that and I don't think Council members at home watching this hopefully will support both the emergencies, that would be solved by the housing and cash in hand relief.",67,,
593,0.97,4922.05,4928.556,"Once again, thank you so much.",67,,
594,0.97,4928.556,4931.426,"I absolutely agree with previous speakers, this is not the time for austerity budgets.",67,,
595,0.97,4931.426,4937.065,Thank you again to Councilmember Sawant's office for hosting this and everyone else who is on the Video tonight.,67,,
596,0.97,4937.065,4937.866,Thanks again.,67,,
597,0.97,4937.866,4947.242,"Thank you, matt for speaking and sharing your union's viewpoint on why this is urgent.",68,,
598,0.97,4947.242,4954.349,"And not only for teachers, but also students and the community is United in wanting urgent relief, needing urgent relief.",68,,
599,0.97,4954.349,4964.893,Next up we have a member of the Union that represents many of the city of Seattle workers.,68,,
600,0.97,4964.893,4973.301,Crystal works in the human services Department of the city of Seattle where she assists Elders in our community.,68,,
601,0.97,4973.301,4976.338,She is a member of the Department's race and social justice change team.,68,,
602,0.97,4976.338,4986.514,Welcome.,68,,
603,0.97,4986.881,4995.39,I am here as a member of city employee and representing my own opinions and thoughts.,69,,
604,0.97,4995.39,5012.407,"Based on what I've been able to see in the community, one of the main things is seeing the effects of Covid-19 on the communities and how clearly disproportionate it is based on how institutions have been set up for decades.",69,,
605,0.97,5012.407,5014.843,And centuries.,69,,
606,0.97,5014.843,5022.15,And really these are so evident it's really important to focus.,69,,
607,0.97,5022.15,5037.032,"So whatever money comes from, however it is that budgets are looked at and reduced, the importance of leading with the value that the city States it has we should be doing that in our work.",69,,
608,0.97,5037.032,5046.775,"We can talk about examples from locations of where quarantine shelters are, where expansion shelters are, who is getting reassigned to do that work.",69,,
609,0.97,5046.775,5066.861,Looking at how budgets affect temporary employees first were often people of color . I am looking at hearing how Caregivers now working with our clients who would otherwise likely be in a hospital or institution are remaining in their homes.,69,,
610,0.97,5066.861,5074.803,Caregivers very often people of color commuting from outside the city because they can't afford to live here.,69,,
611,0.97,5074.803,5082.71,Just now we are starting to get masks another protective equipment for them.,69,,
612,0.97,5082.71,5084.979,Just looking at who are the most wonderful at these times.,69,,
613,0.97,5084.979,5102.23,"Who is experiencing the role of the essential worker, I have the privilege of working from home but there are many tasks and people who are serving and living and experiencing, they should be given the support they need right now.",69,,
614,0.97,5102.23,5121.749,"When we're looking at the budget, when you look at money coming in, they always say let's look at it with a equity lens, when we are in emergency mode weakness the opportunity, if you like we need to make so many decisions quickly.",69,,
615,0.97,5121.749,5133.728,We use that as an excuse to revert back to the systems how they have been set up and I am trying to look at silver Linings of things we are learning from this time.,69,,
616,0.97,5133.728,5157.719,"And how we can actually be working with, bringing in decision-making from the community, looking at how we are getting support, Governance, looking at Governance and homelessness and how committees are set up and how we can be doing these things differently and not really all is leading with race.",69,,
617,0.97,5157.719,5166.794,"Whatever funding sources are happening right now, I just feel it's crucial that we look at how we can do that from a racial lens.",69,,
618,0.97,5166.794,5169.297,Thank you so much.,70,,
619,0.97,5169.297,5181.009,"And now we have Sarah, a climate scientist and environmental justice advocate.",70,,
620,0.97,5181.009,5182.277,Welcome.,70,,
621,0.97,5182.277,5184.712,Hi all.,71,,
622,0.97,5184.712,5186.314,Thank you for having me on.,71,,
623,0.97,5186.314,5195.223,I want to thank all of the other contributors today to the conversation.,71,,
624,0.97,5195.223,5209.637,"The public leaders, educators, the engineers, the Union laborers, and the elected leaders.",71,,
625,0.97,5209.637,5217.245,"I am a climate and ocean scientist, I'm going to talk today briefly about an of the aspects of the effort to generate progressive revenue.",71,,
626,0.97,5217.245,5221.216,Which is imperative to lead on climate.,71,,
627,0.97,5221.216,5239.834,"Just for context, the city of Seattle, the Seattle Council in 2017 upheld the Paris claimant accords to hit the to degree target for the maximum mean global warming of 2 degrees Celsius.",71,,
628,0.97,5239.834,5265.96,"In order for the global community to maintain a commitment of 2 degrees C which themselves have a massive amount of analogies which I will reference, in order to maintain our commitment we need Decarbonization and we need it rapidly.",71,,
629,0.97,5265.96,5275.97,By the city's own calculation we need a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in reference to a 20--2008 level by 2030.,71,,
630,0.97,5275.97,5278.506,Is 10 years away.,71,,
631,0.97,5278.506,5286.514,We need extensive reduction across all sectors of the city's activity.,71,,
632,0.97,5286.514,5296.624,"What this means is we need effective action across transportation, including passenger transportation, transit, Bicycling, safety.",71,,
633,0.97,5296.624,5302.33,"We need transformation across housing, jobs, and livable communities.",71,,
634,0.97,5302.33,5319.647,"We need Transformative change across buildings, multifamily residential buildings, commercial buildings, and Transformative change in the recycling, Composting and waste generation aspects of the city's management.",71,,
635,0.97,5319.647,5334.228,"We need comprehensive, effective and Scalable action that is going to be implemented now to get us to a 50% reduction bite 20/30 in order to maintain the city's already existing commitments to climate action.",71,,
636,0.97,5334.228,5344.772,"So, part of the city, the councils language has already committed a goal of establishing adequate funding to fully implement the comprehensive and rapidly approaching deadline for all of these changes.",71,,
637,0.97,5344.772,5359.187,"This commitment by the city, by the Council particularly was a moment of absolute clarity in public leadership and I applaud the city council for continuing to maintain its commitment to the Paris claimant accords.",71,,
638,0.97,5359.187,5367.662,It continues to put the city into the echelon of global leadership and we are all wanting to be a part of it.,71,,
639,0.97,5367.662,5373.801,And applauding as the benchmark for what global leadership looks like right now.,71,,
640,0.97,5373.801,5385.513,"For the city to adequately address the scale and nature of climate change, what it needs to do is it needs to build progressive revenue sources.",71,,
641,0.97,5385.513,5395.49,"So, for a moment, what does it mean for the city of Seattle in the state of Washington to adapt and respond to climate change?",71,,
642,0.97,5395.49,5413.241,"We know from the snow drought in the fires of 2015 which were an extreme weather year which emissions contributed to, that there were costs up and down different domains of public life.",71,,
643,0.97,5413.241,5414.242,Because of that extreme year.,71,,
644,0.97,5414.242,5422.917,"Public health, equity, are natural resource economy, large sectors of our rural economies were all impacted.",71,,
645,0.97,5422.917,5426.854,2015 was a harbinger.,71,,
646,0.97,5426.854,5434.362,An example of how vulnerable we are at the state level to the kind of warming and disruption coming from climate change.,71,,
647,0.97,5434.362,5435.062,Here's another example.,71,,
648,0.97,5435.062,5445.072,The difference between a global 2 degrees C and global 1.5 degree C target is substantial.,71,,
649,0.97,5445.072,5454.248,We are aiming for eight 2 degrees C target there are massive structural consequences that will come with even this goal.,71,,
650,0.97,5454.248,5466.861,The difference between 1.5 and 2 degrees C is literally hundreds of millions of people experiencing water insecurity and poverty from climate induced factors.,71,,
651,0.97,5466.861,5475.369,"So our ambitious target is still targeting us toward hot, dangerous and Iconic chaotic future.",71,,
652,0.97,5475.369,5477.071,We should be exceeding those goals.,71,,
653,0.97,5477.071,5486.414,"This is why the Seattle city Council, it's imperative to find progressive, little sources of revenue.",71,,
654,0.97,5486.414,5499.126,"It's why I support the effort now to tax Amazon to generate, as we heard earlier today, $120 million annually for green new deal funding.",71,,
655,0.97,5499.126,5508.502,This funding would directly address the areas that need to be the Carbonized in this the city's Purview by a 2030 deadline.,71,,
656,0.97,5508.502,5526.354,What is fantastic about this is this is exactly in line with the goals the city Council has already stated for itself in order to meet these Decarbonization climate goals.,71,,
657,0.97,5526.354,5545.273,"So, if the city council is willing to listen to Epidemiologists and public health officials and to align their actions and behaviors in order to protect people's lives, then it also needs to listen to climate and environmental scientists and align decision-making of the Council to protect and steward the lives of those of us in Washington State and across the planet on a Cato timescale.",71,,
658,0.97,5545.273,5550.144,The actions we take right now will impact the trajectory of our climate for millennia into the future.,71,,
659,0.97,5550.144,5557.685,You cannot pick and choose the science that is convenient for you in order to lead in public.,71,,
660,0.97,5557.685,5563.424,"Let me tell you, there is no more inconvenient science than the science behind climate change.",71,,
661,0.97,5563.424,5568.029,History will judge this generation of public leaders.,71,,
662,0.97,5568.029,5571.132,I want to ensure the city council is on the right side of history.,71,,
663,0.97,5571.132,5578.973,"To be on the right side of history it means Prioritizing progressive revenue, it means taxing Amazon even if it is challenging politically.",71,,
664,0.97,5578.973,5586.914,And to do so means that it will be able to respond effectively to the nature and scale of the climate crisis that is already here.,71,,
665,0.97,5586.914,5592.987,Thank you very much to the Council and to Councilmember Sawant for the time.,71,,
666,0.97,5592.987,5597.024,Thank you all.,71,,
667,0.97,5597.024,5597.825,Thank you.,72,,
668,0.97,5597.825,5622.249,"I just want to follow-up on what you said about how if the Council is paying so much attention, correctly so, to Epidemiologists and Healthcare experts about following the stay at home which we all should adhere to in social distancing, then it only makes sense they should also pay attention to climate scientists in the climate emergency.",72,,
669,0.97,5622.249,5627.154,Can you say why you believe this is tied to the Covid emergency also?,72,,
670,0.97,5627.154,5653.381,"Because you know, it's striking we are having this meeting and I have been completely blown away by the contributions all the way from construction workers to climate scientists and doctors and plumbers, yet I am the only elected official here and no one else's here because somehow discussing emergencies is not allowed during an emergency.",72,,
671,0.97,5653.381,5663.891,Can you talk about how climate emergency whether it's any other kind of emergency we talk about whether economic or Pandemics?,72,,
672,0.97,5663.891,5664.492,Definitely.,73,,
673,0.97,5664.492,5680.107,I am thankful for you to continue to support the kind of Evidence-Based leadership that is required to respond to the scale and nature of both the Covid crisis and also the emergent climate crisis.,73,,
674,0.97,5680.107,5694.522,The reason why I am here today is because of my commitment to public leadership and my desire to help steward public Decision- making to protect people's lives in the future.,73,,
675,0.97,5694.522,5703.097,The same kind of motivation is happening in Epidemiologists and public health officials.,73,,
676,0.97,5703.097,5705.933,We see the same kind of leadership to help steward and protect people's lives.,73,,
677,0.97,5705.933,5717.845,"Now, the Covid crisis and climate crisis are not analogues, they are happening for fundamentally reasons and a different time scales and different consequences.",73,,
678,0.97,5717.845,5740.868,"And yet we can also see from the Covid crisis, one of the manifestations of our profound Connectivity and that the effectiveness of an Intersectional justice focused lens and right action is what is going to be able to lead us toward a science informed society in the future.",73,,
679,0.97,5740.868,5756.083,"Where we include, as we move forward together, climate, workers rights, racial justice, environmental justice, and we all collectively move together.",73,,
680,0.97,5756.083,5757.284,This is an Evidence-Based approach.,73,,
681,0.97,5757.284,5761.388,This is not Orthogonal from the role I have as a public scientist and scholar.,73,,
682,0.97,5761.388,5762.99,That is why I am here today.,73,,
683,0.97,5762.99,5773.968,I think it is very analogous that they would stand up and say I'm here to tell you bad news about how to protect you and your family.,73,,
684,0.97,5773.968,5776.403,Is exactly the same thing as Haima crisis.,73,,
685,0.97,5776.403,5790.417,"What climate crisis will do is it will hurt you, hurt your family, decrease the stability that you have to go to the places you want, eat the food you want, and gather in the places you want.",73,,
686,0.97,5790.417,5799.727,"It will cause the same kind of disruption, systemic disruption, crisis and loss of life that we have seen with 19 right now.",73,,
687,0.97,5799.727,5801.929,Thank you so much.,74,,
688,0.97,5801.929,5814.008,"Sarah mentioned, the term racial justice and I thought was that was what matt and Krista was sharing with us.",74,,
689,0.97,5814.008,5817.044,"In public education and public service, social services.",74,,
690,0.97,5817.044,5819.446,Really that is a big issue we all deal with.,74,,
691,0.97,5819.446,5845.472,"Krista, you can talk about how your coworkers and the people you serve, the communities you serve, the question of racial injustice keeps emerging everywhere you go to Mather whether you talk about the question of rent, or jobs or how the pandemic is affecting people.",74,,
692,0.97,5845.472,5846.473,Whose lives are being lost.,74,,
693,0.97,5846.473,5848.542,How the question of race figures in again and again.,74,,
694,0.97,5848.542,5858.786,Thank you.,75,,
695,0.97,5858.953,5879.406,"I think we have had a few times where we have had been able to pause and speak and share when we do hear about the location of the shelter or something similar to that where we can be like, who is being involved in decision-making?",75,,
696,0.97,5879.406,5882.009,Are people who live in an area involved?,75,,
697,0.97,5882.009,5885.279,Or people receiving that service involved?,75,,
698,0.97,5885.279,5894.622,"And so, both from a racial, language, cultural point, it's important to include those voices.",75,,
699,0.97,5894.622,5900.127,"I was just thinking, it's something we can can certainly continue to do better.",75,,
700,0.97,5900.127,5913.941,"A big area we see for this is are they representing the community's we serve and there are on some levels, but the higher you go the more they are not.",75,,
701,0.97,5913.941,5927.121,"To see how leadership, hiring decisions, that has been a big area we are working on in our Department on how to have our workforce being representative of the community's we serve.",75,,
702,0.97,5927.121,5937.464,And that can be challenging to the system of how things have been done.,75,,
703,0.97,5937.464,5948.676,"That is one way racial equity is trying to support people in positions to give voices, not to organizing but to have a voice the comes with power.",75,,
704,0.97,5948.676,5950.844,"And it's not just shared, it's listen to.",75,,
705,0.97,5950.844,5972.8,"Matt, quickly if you want to share a little bit quickly about how the students you teach, the children of working-class people of color of the most impacted by austerity in public education.",76,,
706,0.97,5972.8,5973.267,Absolutely.,77,,
707,0.97,5973.267,5997.825,"So in education circles you hear talk about Disproportionality and what that means is in a city like Seattle, which is mostly white, you still see far higher percentages of students being disciplined lacking access to housing, in particular, I think the question of Intersectionality has come up and it's not just lack of access to resources.",77,,
708,0.97,5997.825,6001.095,That is a fundamental problem that a lot of students face for a variety of reasons.,77,,
709,0.97,6001.095,6014.441,"But the likelihood if you happen to be Lgbtq as well as black or brown or homeless, all of these factors add up.",77,,
710,0.97,6014.441,6021.348,And what really creates the crisis that a lot of students are facing.,77,,
711,0.97,6021.348,6023.217,Thank you so much.,78,,
712,0.97,6023.217,6030.657,We had an incredible wealth of workers and activists and union leaders here with us.,78,,
713,0.97,6030.657,6033.56,It was incredible.,78,,
714,0.97,6033.56,6043.937,"As I said before, I am just really feeling how much the other Councilmembers missed and I hope they will watch the recording of this meeting.",78,,
715,0.97,6043.937,6047.374,I know I will watch it even though I am here live.,78,,
716,0.97,6047.374,6053.28,Our next item of course is also equally important and that is about Renters and how they can get organized.,78,,
717,0.97,6053.28,6062.99,"In fact, we have is Renters who are organizing themselves already, they're going to share one on one with us the challenges they face and so on.",78,,
718,0.97,6062.99,6082.709,"I want to first of all open this agenda item with a big apology to our Renter speakers were here and to the Renters were watching the committee, I know this agenda point is going to be crunched but only because we're going to have a follow-up meeting very soon.",78,,
719,0.97,6082.709,6090.317,"And a community Organizer for my office is going to be having, is going to share a presentation and introduce our speakers.",78,,
720,0.97,6090.317,6100.294,He's going to share also news about this exciting organizing meeting we are going to have following this meeting where we are going to focus on Renter organizing.,78,,
721,0.97,6100.294,6101.428,"Adam, welcome and take it away.",78,,
722,0.97,6101.562,6104.231,Thank you so much.,79,,
723,0.97,6104.231,6143.47,"That was a phenomenal discussion and I know all the Renters on the call also agree that we need to tax big business and that is another form of making sure working people don't pay . I'm going to go ahead and share the screen, the Powerpoint demonstration so we can really breeze by and make sure we get through quickly . all right.",79,,
724,0.97,6143.47,6155.649,"As I was saying, I'm not going to read the whole Powerpoint display, we are going to get to her Organizer, our speakers as quickly as possible.",79,,
725,0.97,6155.649,6159.086,But we did want to go ahead and make sure people knew this resource is available.,79,,
726,0.97,6159.086,6166.193,We will share the link that is organizing 101 in the chat and the various live streams.,79,,
727,0.97,6166.193,6174.134,"As people have been talking about, this is one of the biggest economic crises we are facing with 40 million people nationwide having lost their jobs.",79,,
728,0.97,6174.134,6182.409,We know that foreclosure and Evictions are going to be the way that corporate landlords and big banks make working people pay.,79,,
729,0.97,6182.409,6208.235,"We have seen for closure and Evictions moratoriums but that is to protect, we know that thousands of dollars of debt are going to be accumulating and there is literally zero prospect for most workers who without jobs, sometimes for several months, zero prospect of paying for that back rent.",79,,
730,0.97,6208.235,6218.612,"In reality what we are talking about when we hear from these Renters, we are talking about organizing and fighting against a massive wave of Evictions that we are going to be seeing unless we organize and fight.",79,,
731,0.97,6218.612,6223.65,We don't need to kind of guess about this.,79,,
732,0.97,6223.65,6227.955,"We saw after the great recession nearly 8 million working people, working-class homeowners were foreclosed on by the banks.",79,,
733,0.97,6227.955,6244.771,"Even in the midst of this pandemic we are seeing Billionaires increasing their wealth, Profiteering, just as we heard in depth before as they are fighting against paying modest amounts of taxes.",79,,
734,0.97,6244.771,6246.473,So that working people can get basic things.,79,,
735,0.97,6246.473,6248.275,We do need to get organized.,79,,
736,0.97,6248.275,6253.146,And we need to do it right now.,79,,
737,0.97,6253.146,6262.489,"Concretely, what are we talking about when we say that workers shouldn't pay and that corporate management companies, big landlords and big banks should pay?",79,,
738,0.97,6262.489,6279.506,"We are talking about fighting so that rent, utilities and mortgage are canceled so we do not have to pay if we are working people who have lost their jobs and lost significant pay and hours as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.",79,,
739,0.97,6279.506,6294.788,We also know of course over the past couple of months there is literally thousands of Renters have begun the process of getting organized in their buildings and beyond . We know this is not an easy path.,79,,
740,0.97,6294.788,6297.457,It's not as simple as calling for something like a rent strike.,79,,
741,0.97,6297.457,6301.528,We know that building my building organizing is going to be necessary but it's going to take time.,79,,
742,0.97,6301.528,6312.239,"And if we doubt at all before we are going on to hear from our speakers, if we doubt that this is necessary, we can look to the ruling class Renters.",79,,
743,0.97,6312.239,6313.173,Business Renters.,79,,
744,0.97,6313.173,6315.709,Starbucks.,79,,
745,0.97,6315.709,6317.744,We just found is demanding a full year of rent.,79,,
746,0.97,6317.744,6319.546,Cheesecake factory has done the same.,79,,
747,0.97,6319.546,6345.772,"Subway has told their owners, the franchisees . We also know another thing, the political establishment will not protect working-class Renters and homeowners . So if we are going to protect ourselves, we need to get organized and many to do that by building our collective powers and movement.",79,,
748,0.97,6345.772,6361.254,"Let's go ahead and hear from a couple Renters in Seattle, tenants of buildings managed . a company that manages 5500 units in the Seattle area.",79,,
749,0.97,6361.254,6362.956,75 buildings in Capitol Hill alone.,79,,
750,0.97,6362.956,6373.6,"The fate of organizing doesn't just impact, it's thousands of Renters.",79,,
751,0.97,6373.6,6381.274,"First we are going to hear from Jason was a Photojournalist, a tenant at the Soto arms.",79,,
752,0.97,6381.274,6386.179,Go ahead.,79,,
753,0.97,6386.179,6390.016,Can you hear me?,80,,
754,0.97,6390.016,6391.017,Yes.,81,,
755,0.97,6391.017,6392.819,Awesome.,82,,
756,0.97,6392.819,6398.358,"Thank you Adam, thank you Councilmember Sawant.",82,,
757,0.97,6398.358,6410.771,"As Adam mentioned I'm a Self- employed photographer and I live in district 6, I am here representing my own opinions and experiences.",82,,
758,0.97,6410.771,6414.307,Thankfully I am still working but I do worry about the future for myself and other Working- class people.,82,,
759,0.97,6414.307,6421.548,"I have seen too many of my friends and colleagues that were laid off, especially in 2008 and I was laid off and decided to Freelance.",82,,
760,0.97,6421.548,6430.857,"About my building, my original landlord had the building since the 1970s and it was a wonderful woman.",82,,
761,0.97,6430.857,6437.564,Had a good relationship with the tenants and we had a maintenance worker who is here a lot and knew all the tenants on a first name basis.,82,,
762,0.97,6437.564,6439.766,We had a good relationship with him.,82,,
763,0.97,6439.766,6446.506,In October our landlord retired and sold our building.,82,,
764,0.97,6446.506,6463.39,"In November I received a notice from our new building manager, Cornell and Associates, that rent was going up 37% for my unit getting February 1. this is completely legal with the 60 day advance notice because there is no rent control in Washington state.",82,,
765,0.97,6463.39,6470.664,By the way I should mention that Oregon passed a statewide rent control late last year which is something I would like to see happen in Washington too.,82,,
766,0.97,6470.664,6485.111,Also worth Meshing didn't mentioning in Portland they raised $2.5 billion by taxing big business over 10 years to fight homelessness which I think is inspiring.,82,,
767,0.97,6485.111,6490.817,The rent increase at my building was very shocking and frustrating.,82,,
768,0.97,6490.817,6501.127,"And over the previous years I have lived here, I had only seen about eight 3% annual read rent increase which is a standard rent increase.",82,,
769,0.97,6501.127,6506.833,"When I appealed to Cornell and Associates about the excessive increase, I had difficulty getting a quick response.",82,,
770,0.97,6506.833,6527.153,And I was finally able to speak the person managing my building and they assured me they had done extensive research on the rents in my area and I was playing paying below market value and even suggested the could've charged me more than they did.,82,,
771,0.97,6527.153,6530.023,In fact saying the could've charged a 60% increase instead of the almost 40% increase.,82,,
772,0.97,6530.023,6542.569,"This is despite the building I live in is 93 years old and has issues like low water pressure, when showers are shut off when the neighbor is running water.",82,,
773,0.97,6542.569,6545.272,"Thin walls, you can hear neighbors coughing.",82,,
774,0.97,6545.272,6556.583,When the pandemic hit Seattle egg and reached out to Cornell and Associates to inquire about rents being returned to the original amount to help us get through the pandemic.,82,,
775,0.97,6556.583,6576.303,"But after going through another significant effort to get a response, I got a denial Email suggesting among other things that we ask our parents for money, put the rent on a credit card or find a job among the businesses operating during the pandemic.",82,,
776,0.97,6576.303,6589.316,"As a result of the rent increase, several of my neighbors decided to move out during the pandemic.",82,,
777,0.97,6589.316,6592.385,"And as a last resort, I decided to appeal to the new building owners directly.",82,,
778,0.97,6592.385,6598.358,I discovered an article in the October 14 issue of the Daily Journal of Commerce that our building had been purchased by a family that owns Copiers Northwest.,82,,
779,0.97,6598.358,6606.333,It mentioned after the soldier Southlake Union building for 25 $28.5 million they started buying investment properties.,82,,
780,0.97,6606.333,6619.779,Eventually I received a reply from Cornell and Associates that I should not contact the new building owners directly and only reach out through the tenant liaison who would contact Cornell and Associates.,82,,
781,0.97,6619.779,6628.989,Basically Cornell and Associates were hired to do one job which is to make as much profit as possible for their clients.,82,,
782,0.97,6628.989,6644.237,"In fact, on their Website it explicitly says, ""they want to achieve Axmen income under constantly changing economic conditions while increasing property values ."" Unfortunately there are many examples of greed and price gouging all around us, especially right now during the pandemic.",82,,
783,0.97,6644.237,6656.549,Is Renters we need to stand up for what we feel is fair and Cornell and Associates is working very hard to shake every penny from our pockets with very little concern about people moving out during the pandemic.,82,,
784,0.97,6656.549,6661.187,We cannot do this alone but if we stand together as neighbors can be heard.,82,,
785,0.97,6661.187,6674.801,If everyone living in one of the 5500 units managed by Cornell and Associates all signs a petition sends an Email we could have our requests taken seriously.,82,,
786,0.97,6674.801,6677.704,This is something I never had to do in all my years as a Renter.,82,,
787,0.97,6677.704,6679.906,But I feel it's important especially during the uncertain times.,82,,
788,0.97,6679.906,6691.317,"We are not only in the pandemic, you're likely heading into another great depression and we all need to look out for one another and help bring out positive changes.",82,,
789,0.97,6691.317,6703.43,"To Cornell and Associates I would like to say we are not just people who pay rent . We are the ones who teacher kids, working your hospitals, the music you enjoy, build your housing and we work in the stores to help make Seattle.",82,,
790,0.97,6703.43,6705.365,The city we love to live in.,82,,
791,0.97,6705.365,6709.703,So thank you Adam and Councilmember.,82,,
792,0.97,6709.703,6714.441,"Thank you, Jason for those really Impactful words.",83,,
793,0.97,6714.441,6723.116,"We are excited to continue of course, we are excited to continue working with Jason and other Renters.",83,,
794,0.97,6723.116,6731.024,On June 4 we have Renters organizing meeting to fight against Coronavirus Evictions.,83,,
795,0.97,6731.024,6734.761,We will have a Facebook event posted.,83,,
796,0.97,6734.761,6744.471,"Let's go ahead and hear from another Seattle Renter, Victoria price, a tissue recovery technician who has seen her hours reduced.",83,,
797,0.97,6744.471,6749.743,She is a tenant at the East Mercer apartments also managed by Cornell and Associates.,83,,
798,0.97,6749.743,6754.247,"Victoria, go ahead and tell us about your situation.",83,,
799,0.97,6754.247,6755.348,All right.,84,,
800,0.97,6755.348,6764.224,"Yeah, as a tissue recovery technician I job is to recover I tissue for transplant to help cure Corneal blindness.",84,,
801,0.97,6764.224,6768.495,At the beginning of the year I was injured pretty badly at work.,84,,
802,0.97,6768.495,6770.73,It took weeks for me to recover.,84,,
803,0.97,6770.73,6779.606,But then the week I went back to work happen to be the same exact work elective Surgeries were canceled.,84,,
804,0.97,6779.606,6790.016,"And we saw the demand for tissue, eye tissue and technicians like my self dropped to virtually zero overnight.",84,,
805,0.97,6790.016,6796.489,"That was really, really difficult especially after having not been able to work for longtime.",84,,
806,0.97,6796.489,6813.806,"And due to so much uncertainty with the company on how they were going to proceed with staff and what this meant for Cornea donations, I was not able to file for unemployment as quickly as a lot of other people.",84,,
807,0.97,6813.806,6822.649,And when I finally did apply I discovered that the and employment insurance Department had actually no record whatsoever that I had ever worked for this employer.,84,,
808,0.97,6822.649,6828.755,Due to an error from wage reporting in 2019.,84,,
809,0.97,6828.755,6845.872,When they calculated my Unappointed benefits they decided to award me about $250 per week based solely on the one service industry I have had in 2019.,84,,
810,0.97,6845.872,6850.143,It has taken weeks to sort this out and get the numbers up to date and figure out where things are.,84,,
811,0.97,6850.143,6857.25,I still have not received the appropriate benefit amount that I should be receiving.,84,,
812,0.97,6857.25,6866.392,"Not working for most of the year, then NOTE shifts, no donors, and then applying for unemployment, that is not an option either.",84,,
813,0.97,6866.392,6886.713,"It just turned into this perfect storm where I literally fell through the cracks and I'm just waiting on everything being finalized in terms of my workplace injury, in terms of Surgeries and in terms of unemployment.",84,,
814,0.97,6886.713,6890.917,I have been waiting for weeks.,84,,
815,0.97,6890.917,6894.22,"Actually months, for any sort of payment.",84,,
816,0.97,6894.22,6902.128,"In March and reached out to my apartment manager, to say I couldn't pay rent for April.",84,,
817,0.97,6902.128,6911.638,And asked if Cornell and Associates is offering any rent relief or suspension to help those of lost their jobs or income due to Covid-19.,84,,
818,0.97,6911.638,6913.106,He was super sympathetic.,84,,
819,0.97,6913.106,6915.341,But Unfortunately said no.,84,,
820,0.97,6915.341,6917.277,I couldn't do much more to help.,84,,
821,0.97,6917.277,6928.321,A few days later I received a letter from Cornell and Associates stating that all Renters will be due at the end of the temporary Eviction moratorium.,84,,
822,0.97,6928.321,6932.759,With a very strong emphasis on temporary.,84,,
823,0.97,6932.759,6938.264,"They suggested asking friends or family members, to give you money to help cover your rent.",84,,
824,0.97,6938.264,6951.077,"Or to take out loans, which was for me a little disturbing almost, ask your friends to help pay for your rent, we are going to help you.",84,,
825,0.97,6951.077,6963.456,That I reached out to rent relief after seeing posters around the neighborhood and I learned that tenants in my building were also concerned.,84,,
826,0.97,6963.456,6975.068,I had a list of individuals willing to join a request for rent relief with the help of a neighbor and soon after Adam contacted me and that's when I was put in touch with some of the tenets.,84,,
827,0.97,6975.068,6994.053,"But another apartment managed by Cornell and Associates on the front page of the Seattle times a few weeks ago, and is a Renter, for a few weeks now I have been working together support from individuals for those people who are unable to pay rent due to the impacts of Covid-19.",84,,
828,0.97,6994.053,7011.17,"As a Renter who has both lost all income and got animal implement benefits for the last few months, I am unsure if I will have a home at the end of this pandemic.",84,,
829,0.97,7011.17,7022.749,"And fighting for rent relief, especially while juggling my own personal life and other struggles has been difficult.",84,,
830,0.97,7022.749,7034.961,And I am really hopeful and looking forward to working with others so that we can get the financial support we need during this difficult time.,84,,
831,0.97,7034.961,7038.431,It's just not fair to the Renters.,84,,
832,0.97,7038.431,7039.565,Thanks.,84,,
833,0.97,7039.565,7042.869,"Thank you so much, Victoria.",85,,
834,0.97,7042.869,7049.809,"We know it's not just a couple Renters, literally thousands of people are in that situation.",85,,
835,0.97,7049.809,7055.081,Not being able to have a home at the end of this pandemic.,85,,
836,0.97,7055.081,7065.658,That is why one of the big reasons we have this agenda item was to provide a certain 101 for people when they are in that situation.,85,,
837,0.97,7065.658,7068.094,One of the first steps.,85,,
838,0.97,7068.094,7083.309,"Going to go ahead and share my screen again . and again, I'm not going to be going through each one but I will speed through a little bit and there's a link in the chat.",85,,
839,0.97,7083.309,7096.722,"So Yeah, for people who are either experiencing the loss of a job or who just want to support their neighbors so they don't get evicted, there are concrete steps we can do to begin that organizing process.",85,,
840,0.97,7096.722,7101.294,One of them is to deliver an Online meeting invitation.,85,,
841,0.97,7101.294,7108.1,You see a sample invitation.,85,,
842,0.97,7108.1,7108.734,It's not super complex.,85,,
843,0.97,7108.734,7110.636,And we can of course help out with this.,85,,
844,0.97,7110.636,7115.608,One of the big things we are emphasizing in this is people should be in contact with us and other organizations.,85,,
845,0.97,7115.608,7121.247,The next thing is you have to prepare a first meeting.,85,,
846,0.97,7121.247,7131.657,"Send out an agenda, you can see a basic thing like assessing the needs in the building, getting to know your tenants, establishing a name and having a meeting set up.",85,,
847,0.97,7131.657,7142.235,"In terms of the first meeting, we want to have a goal establishing a core group of organizing and developing a plan.",85,,
848,0.97,7142.235,7144.67,It's not something that is going to be overnight.,85,,
849,0.97,7144.67,7153.179,"If you find one other tenant out of this meeting that wants to organize, that is a success.",85,,
850,0.97,7153.179,7153.779,More is better.,85,,
851,0.97,7153.779,7155.148,But it requires patience and persistence.,85,,
852,0.97,7155.148,7170.196,Another thing we found and we will hear from a Renter very soon is that a tenant need survey is a good way to reach out to other people in the building to ask how they've been affected.,85,,
853,0.97,7170.196,7186.512,"And then to begin to find those people who are interested in fighting to make it so tenants and working people don't pay the cost of this crisis, but rather the millionaires, the corporate companies and banks have the money can.",85,,
854,0.97,7186.512,7196.422,"That brings us to the last simple step of this, the beginning process, which is building your group.",85,,
855,0.97,7196.422,7206.799,"If your group a name, start a group chat, it's kind of a Nonintuitive thing, but it's okay if not everyone not wanting to join your group automatically.",85,,
856,0.97,7206.799,7220.413,"Of course you want to be in conversation with everybody, you want to win over everyone in the building, but the group should be for people who don't think Renters should have to pay the cost and who do think we are going to have to come together collectively to win that.",85,,
857,0.97,7220.413,7237.863,"Once you establish a basic group, then we can begin looking forward, drafting a demand letter, delivering the demand letter, we will here in a bit from organizers, organizing Trainings so you know your rights.",85,,
858,0.97,7237.863,7244.237,And of course public actions and following up.,85,,
859,0.97,7244.237,7259.652,"Linking up with the broader movement, these are all things we have found and other Renters have found will be necessary in order to make it so the people who have all the money right now actually do end up paying the cost of this crisis.",85,,
860,0.97,7259.652,7268.361,So right now let's go ahead and listen to--we've got another Organizer Renter who has gone through a lot of the steps.,85,,
861,0.97,7268.361,7280.539,"His name is Shawn, he is currently laid off . tell us about your experience so far doing some of this organizing.",85,,
862,0.97,7280.539,7282.308,How it is gone and challenges.,85,,
863,0.97,7282.308,7285.378,,86,,
864,0.97,7285.378,7293.519,"Thanks for having this panel and this meeting, I think it's really important.",87,,
865,0.97,7293.519,7297.823,We need to keep having these conversations keep working together.,87,,
866,0.97,7297.823,7298.824,My name is Sean case.,87,,
867,0.97,7298.824,7308.134,I am a laid off line Cook . I am also a member of the Democratic Socialists of America.,87,,
868,0.97,7308.134,7318.744,I believe that building organizing is really key to achieving any kind of justice for Renters in this crisis and beyond it.,87,,
869,0.97,7318.744,7324.817,"A lot of folks are out of work and scared right now, a lot of my neighbors are.",87,,
870,0.97,7324.817,7331.123,Some are already unable to pay the rent and others are worried about their ability to pay rent in the coming months.,87,,
871,0.97,7331.123,7338.431,As the economic fallout comes out it's going to last a long time.,87,,
872,0.97,7338.431,7346.772,Getting a sense of what your neighbors need right now is an important place to start.,87,,
873,0.97,7346.772,7355.281,"You have to meet your neighbors, get them in a meeting, talk to them to see who needs what.",87,,
874,0.97,7355.281,7358.15,"You can work on a needs assessment survey, that's what we did in our building.",87,,
875,0.97,7358.15,7366.659,When we first surveyed in my building we found that about one third of us were out of work due to Covid which is a pretty significant portion.,87,,
876,0.97,7366.659,7368.527,Some of those folks are now getting unemployment benefits.,87,,
877,0.97,7368.527,7370.896,But some still aren't.,87,,
878,0.97,7370.896,7379.672,There is a myth that all these extended employment benefits are being distributed equally to everyone and everyone will be fine.,87,,
879,0.97,7379.672,7381.307,That is not the case.,87,,
880,0.97,7381.307,7395.621,Being able to show your neighbors the people in your building are suffering goes a long way to get people on board for organizing.,87,,
881,0.97,7395.621,7419.245,"Bait on based on the initial needs were able to draft a letter . Even though we got nearly 40 signatures on the first letter which is a majority of my building, it went unanswered by our landlord . Our property management company, Cornell Associates, did respond but with a form letter.",87,,
882,0.97,7419.245,7436.061,"It sounds like the same one that Victoria and I've heard from handful of others, tenants and other buildings got the same letter asking you to ask your parents for money, get a new credit card, get a job.",87,,
883,0.97,7436.061,7439.565,During Covid.,87,,
884,0.97,7439.565,7447.673,Which is totally out of touch.,87,,
885,0.97,7447.673,7455.08,They expect to collect the full rent as if there isn't an emergency happening.,87,,
886,0.97,7455.08,7458.884,At that point it was clear that a letter wasn't enough.,87,,
887,0.97,7458.884,7465.09,It was met with silence from our landlord an act of aggression from Cornell Associates.,87,,
888,0.97,7465.09,7465.991,We had to elevate our goal.,87,,
889,0.97,7465.991,7484.276,Friend of mine put me in touch with Seattle times and I talked to him about what we were doing and why and around that same time Adam reached out to me and offered to help us out.,87,,
890,0.97,7484.276,7490.182,Some of us sent a strong letter on her behalf to meet with us and respond to our needs.,87,,
891,0.97,7490.182,7506.832,The office also helped us with an Email campaign during which around 300 community members Emailed Cornell and Associates demanding they respond to us.,87,,
892,0.97,7506.832,7519.612,"The baseline thing we are asking for is to start a conversation that has been refused it doesn't seem like we are asking for that much during the first hours of that campaign, Cornell Associates took their Website off-line.",87,,
893,0.97,7519.612,7529.255,It was back a few days later but as of right now the only available function on the Website is the pay rent button.,87,,
894,0.97,7529.255,7531.19,I think that is pretty telling.,87,,
895,0.97,7531.19,7541.166,"A week after that, we delivered the letter that was signed by Renters in three other buildings that they run.",87,,
896,0.97,7541.166,7542.635,They failed to respond to that letter.,87,,
897,0.97,7542.635,7546.171,So the actions we took reactions.,87,,
898,0.97,7546.171,7549.675,That is good.,87,,
899,0.97,7549.675,7554.079,If we hadn't elevated our struggle we would've got nothing.,87,,
900,0.97,7554.079,7565.691,"We continue, we don't see this as a reason to back down and give up.",87,,
901,0.97,7565.691,7572.665,One lesson I have learned so far in the struggle is that we need to be really patient and keep unity and keep building.,87,,
902,0.97,7572.665,7578.504,Cornell and Associates loves to ignore us until the crisis goes away.,87,,
903,0.97,7578.504,7581.607,But this isn't going away anytime soon.,87,,
904,0.97,7581.607,7594.386,Anyone in touch with reality realizes that it's clear to me that we need a movement big enough to meet the size of the developing economic crisis.,87,,
905,0.97,7594.386,7604.93,"I am hopeful we can build that movement, one well-organized building doesn't win the fight for justice a network of organized buildings throughout the city can.",87,,
906,0.97,7604.93,7612.705,It's important we share resources and experiences like we do now and we continue to do that and work in concert with each other.,87,,
907,0.97,7612.705,7643.936,"This isn't merely about winning discounts for Renters in one building who's having a hard time paying rent, although that is important, and we could do that, this is about making sure when the moratorium is lifted it's about making sure we are all paying attention as this crisis develops it's also that way in the groundwork for more robust Renters.",87,,
908,0.97,7643.936,7646.171,One that is going to fight for housing justice beyond Covid.,87,,
909,0.97,7646.171,7651.276,And address the inherent power balance.,87,,
910,0.97,7651.276,7655.28,The wealthy to profit from the basic human need of housing.,87,,
911,0.97,7655.28,7665.09,"Jason referred to this, a building movement like this is how we get rent control.",87,,
912,0.97,7665.09,7666.859,It's something we desperately need.,87,,
913,0.97,7666.859,7672.798,"I am determined to keep working with my neighbors and tenants across the city, tenants watching this call.",87,,
914,0.97,7672.798,7683.976,"And any other person ready to get organized and make sure management companies and big banks pay for this crisis, not working people.",87,,
915,0.97,7683.976,7686.011,We can't afford to.,87,,
916,0.97,7686.011,7696.321,I hope to see everyone at the organizing meeting on June 4 so we can get to work on this and keep talking and working together.,87,,
917,0.97,7696.321,7699.391,Thank you.,88,,
918,0.97,7699.391,7700.826,I would tend to agree.,88,,
919,0.97,7700.826,7710.235,It sounds like Cornell and Associates doesn't agree with you given their Website has one function which is the ability to pay rent right now.,88,,
920,0.97,7710.235,7714.84,You literally can't make that step up.,88,,
921,0.97,7714.84,7729.555,And going to go to Maia who is an Organizer with an organization that our office has worked with over the past few years gathering thousands of signatures for rent control.,88,,
922,0.97,7729.555,7734.46,"They have put on dozens of boot camps, know your rights camps.",88,,
923,0.97,7734.46,7738.564,We are excited that my is here.,88,,
924,0.97,7738.564,7739.832,The Organizer of be Seattle.,88,,
925,0.97,7739.832,7750.042,We are excited they are also wanting to participate in this fight to make it so we don't seek mass Evictions as a result of Covid-19.,88,,
926,0.97,7750.042,7751.176,"Go ahead, Maia.",88,,
927,0.97,7751.176,7755.08,I'm going to share a screen she has provided for us.,88,,
928,0.97,7755.08,7758.884,I apologize it's a bit Grainy.,88,,
929,0.97,7758.884,7762.488,There will be links in the Chats in the wide stream.,88,,
930,0.97,7762.488,7769.695,Thank you so much to everyone who has spoken in this agenda point in the previous one.,89,,
931,0.97,7769.695,7775.634,I am in Organizer with be Seattle.,89,,
932,0.97,7775.634,7777.603,I wanted to share two resources.,89,,
933,0.97,7777.603,7784.71,"The first is, we are hosting almost weekly tenant rights camps which talk about our rights as Renters.",89,,
934,0.97,7784.71,7787.513,Under Seattle and Washington state law.,89,,
935,0.97,7787.513,7801.793,We address current protections and common questions related to renting during Covid-19 and we go into some of what we've been talking to tonight early stages of living organizing.,89,,
936,0.97,7801.793,7816.441,We think education is the first step and that organizing is necessary to not only enforce our current protections but also as part of a bigger fight to Re-Envision what housing looks like in this country.,89,,
937,0.97,7816.441,7821.647,Our upcoming workshop is tomorrow night at 6:30 PM.,89,,
938,0.97,7821.647,7830.222,"Hopefully a link will be sent or in the comments, you can also find it at our Facebook page at be Seattle.",89,,
939,0.97,7830.222,7846.071,We would love to work with people who have or are interested in forming building tenant associations and leading a workshop directly with you to answer your questions and give a grounding in some of your rights as tenants in Seattle.,89,,
940,0.97,7846.071,7857.449,"The second resource is the tenant research portal which covers Capitol Hill, central district, Madison Valley, Madison Park, Baker, part of North beacon Hill.",89,,
941,0.97,7857.449,7865.357,We are working expanding that.,89,,
942,0.97,7865.357,7877.703,"Basically it's a tool you can use to kind of click on your address and look at who owns the building, does it have Passcode complaints, code violations, as a landlord serial of Victor?",89,,
943,0.97,7877.703,7882.608,It's a great for steps one up about your building.,89,,
944,0.97,7882.608,7896.421,You are welcome to reach out to me and the rest of the be Seattle team if you are interested in Partnering with us to work on eight tenant rights workshop or are in need of organizing support.,89,,
945,0.97,7896.421,7899.491,"Thank you so much to everyone, I appreciate it.",89,,
946,0.97,7899.491,7904.73,"Thank you so much, Maia.",90,,

948,0.97,7907.199,7920.612,I know my Aunt will be there at the June 4 Seattle Renters organizing meeting so we can fight Evictions.,90,,
949,0.97,7920.612,7924.85,I'm having a little trouble sharing the screen.,90,,
950,0.97,7924.85,7927.552,We just got right now a few things to close down.,90,,
951,0.97,7927.552,7934.426,Obviously it wouldn't be an organizing meeting if we didn't have next steps.,90,,
952,0.97,7934.426,7942.768,We know there are next steps around taxing Amazon to fund Covid-19 relief.,90,,
953,0.97,7942.768,7948.24,To build social housing and the new green deal program.,90,,
954,0.97,7948.24,7952.878,Are also going to be organizing to fight Eviction.,90,,
955,0.97,7952.878,7955.347,We have the June 4 organizing meeting.,90,,

958,0.97,7969.995,7977.302,"We also have fighting Eviction survey, that is the last link I will share.",90,,
959,0.97,7977.302,7984.409,"Please go there, fill out, we want to find out who has been laid off, people who have lost significant pay.",90,,
960,0.97,7984.409,7994.619,"And most importantly, contact our office, get organized, come to the organizing meeting.",90,,
961,0.97,7994.619,7999.224,There is a lot we could do.,90,,
962,0.97,7999.224,8023.815,"At the end of the day, as all the tenants have explained in the speakers for the tax Amazon meeting explained, if we don't organize and fight, it's going to mean a lot of Evictions, it's going to mean working people are going to pay this cost instead of the billionaire corporations, the Superrich individuals like Jeff Bezos we know has literally made $30 billion since the Coronavirus had to make a started.",90,,
963,0.97,8023.815,8037.162,Please reach out to us and let's get organized and fight so we don't pay the cost of this crisis.,90,,
964,0.97,8037.162,8041.867,"I believe, Councilmember Sawant you are going to take it from here and closeout the meeting.",90,,
965,0.97,8042.0,8042.868,"Thank you, Adam.",91,,
966,0.97,8042.868,8044.736,And thank you to the Renter Organizer speakers.,91,,
967,0.97,8044.736,8058.683,"Once again, I want to extend my apologies to you all and everyone was watching this, it got a little Scrunched but hopefully you found it as valuable as I did.",91,,
968,0.97,8058.683,8069.294,And even if it was shorter than the tax Amazon portion it was extremely informative and exciting to see that tenants are organizing.,91,,
969,0.97,8069.294,8088.18,"I could not agree more with what Shawn said, absolutely every building organizing, even one building Organizer and one victory is crucial because that will affect all but we don't have a need to stop there and we cannot stop there.",91,,
970,0.97,8088.18,8093.085,And network of buildings are successfully organizing and will begin to constitute the kind of messed movement we need.,91,,
971,0.97,8093.085,8100.525,We need to start building now before the wave of Evictions hits.,91,,
972,0.97,8100.525,8110.535,"It's not an idle fear, it is exactly what will happen unless we prepare and fight back in fighting back is getting organized.",91,,
973,0.97,8110.535,8138.363,"Is one of Adams slides said, Evictions, foreclosures, joblessness, permanent loss of jobs, austerity in the public sector, jobs are Furloughs, cuts to services, cuts to education, all of these are various forms in which the billionaire class extracts the cost of the recession from us, putting all the costs on us.",91,,
974,0.97,8138.363,8141.166,And themselves Profiteering.,91,,
975,0.97,8141.166,8150.342,"Or else, maybe some are not Profiteering but they are not actually paying for the crisis.",91,,
976,0.97,8150.342,8153.778,"We can't have it this way because as many of you said, it is simply not fair.",91,,
977,0.97,8153.778,8165.991,That's why it's important that we were discussing both taxing big business to create a Publics work program and job and how as Renters we can fight back.,91,,
978,0.97,8165.991,8172.197,Of course if there are other working-class or middle-class homeowners without their job a will face for closure just as we saw after the great recession.,91,,
979,0.97,8172.197,8173.498,We need to unite.,91,,
980,0.97,8173.498,8185.31,"If there are small landlords watching and you are on our side, I know some of you are, you are welcome to join this Úmovement as well as small businesses getting slammed well big businesses Profiteer.",91,,
981,0.97,8185.31,8190.382,Join us June 4 for the next steps of the Renter organizing.,91,,

984,0.97,8195.12,8202.294,"I know it's late, but this was a very, very important meeting and I'm so glad we were able to do this.",91,,
985,0.97,8202.294,8220.412,"Thank you so much, last but not least, for everyone in my city council office, thanks to all the Socialist community organizers we have in our office.",91,,
986,0.97,8220.412,8238.863,"Ted who is been the backbone of the zoo meetings and incredible technology, Adam who's been helping to organize alongside the tenants, and John who is been a big part of everything we had done including organizing the labor movement and whose voices were here tonight with us.",91,,
987,0.97,8238.863,8240.465,Thank you all so much.,91,,
988,0.97,8240.465,8241.132,Take care.,91,,
989,0.97,8241.132,8258.383,"Make sure to social distance and stayed home if you can, stand in solidarity, we will continue organizing to win the Amazon tax and to make sure we win our demands for complete suspension without consequences of rent, mortgage payments.",91,,
990,0.97,8258.383,8268.86,"Solidarity, and good night.",91,,
