148,0.97,1374.506,1380.212,"Great . Lily, I think that is the end of the presentation, right?",26,,
149,0.97,1380.212,1383.315,We are all finished.,27,,

152,0.97,1397.095,1398.73,"Council President, I do have a question.",29,,
153,0.97,1398.73,1400.198,"Go ahead Councilmember Mosqueda, please.",30,,
154,0.97,1400.198,1400.799,Thank you.,31,,
155,0.97,1400.799,1406.838,Let me get my camera up here.,31,,
156,0.97,1406.838,1407.272,"Hello, everybody.",31,,
157,0.97,1407.272,1407.806,"Hello, Councilmember.",32,,
158,0.97,1407.806,1412.11,Good look at this upcoming session.,33,,
159,0.97,1412.11,1416.448,I am glad to hear that it is going to be hybrid so that everybody is health and safety is protected.,33,,
160,0.97,1416.448,1419.851,"I did have a question, Hannah, about the long-term insurance plan.",33,,
161,0.97,1419.851,1427.092,I know our friends worked really hard on that legislation.,33,,
162,0.97,1427.092,1441.973,"I personally don't think that it makes a lot of sense to have competing plans especially among local jurisdictions like we have here in Seattle . I think it makes the most sense to have one large pool, thus the concept of insurance.",33,,
163,0.97,1441.973,1447.879,Can you tell me a little bit more about what some of the policy changes are that are being described or discussed?,33,,
164,0.97,1447.879,1468.733,"If you don't have those details right now, I just want to flag for you my interest in helping to make sure that that statewide insurance plan remains strong because I think that helps us and the population of Seattle has good coverage especially for low income and our most marginalized populations.",33,,
165,0.97,1468.733,1472.504,I do think it is important that we play as good partners in the new insurance plan.,33,,
166,0.97,1472.504,1483.615,Are there any proposed policy changes to that insurance pool or are we just tracking that there is possible concerns coming up?,33,,
167,0.97,1483.615,1485.15,"Thank you for your support, Councilmember Mosqueda.",34,,
168,0.97,1485.15,1489.287,I am sure we will call on you this session as it comes up.,34,,
169,0.97,1489.287,1491.623,"At this point, I don't have anything super specific to share.",34,,
170,0.97,1491.623,1502.734,"It has been something that a lot of legislators have heard concerns about gender trying to figure out the best way to, as you said, meet the needs and create this pool that will help everyone.",34,,
171,0.97,1502.734,1507.806,It is new and everyone is figuring out how this will impact them.,34,,
172,0.97,1507.806,1514.446,Happy to follow up . at this point we are hearing that there is thought floating around.,34,,
173,0.97,1514.446,1517.048,As we get specifics I will reach out to you.,34,,
174,0.97,1517.048,1519.217,Hannah is correct.,35,,
175,0.97,1519.217,1563.895,"One thing I would add is in conversation with folks at 775, it sounds like there has been some really positive conversations around legitimate concerns folks have around Affordability and then around accessibility for folks who are potentially not able to access the program at this stage in their life . I think there is a real goodwill investment in making sure that appropriate access is made available to more folks . those are just challenging details with legislation that is significant.",35,,
176,0.97,1563.895,1565.096,They are working on a bill.,35,,
177,0.97,1565.096,1569.1,"We will make sure to keep you posted on that, given your concerns.",35,,
178,0.97,1569.1,1573.405,It sounds like they're wanting to continue to improve the policy for everyone as well.,35,,
179,0.97,1573.405,1574.205,Great.,36,,
180,0.97,1574.205,1574.406,Okay.,36,,
181,0.97,1574.406,1592.724,"If you think about our existing social insurance programs like unemployment insurance or workers compensation, it would not make any sense to have local jurisdictions try to mirror a statewide insurance plan when you want everyone to pay and so that rates remain low and people have access when needed.",36,,
182,0.97,1592.724,1617.449,"Just from that high level perspective, I will look forward to engaging more with all of you if we see specific changes . I would be very interested in making sure that we are thinking about the Sustainability and the long- term trajectory of that insurance program for our most vulnerable that's to live in the city that could benefit from lower rates potentially at the state level.",36,,
183,0.97,1617.449,1618.65,I will keep my eyes open.,36,,
184,0.97,1618.65,1619.985,Thank you for that information.,36,,
185,0.97,1619.985,1624.756,Thank you so much Councilmember Mosqueda.,37,,
186,0.97,1624.756,1625.79,Any other questions or comments?,37,,
187,0.97,1625.79,1654.552,"Again, colleagues, you will have the next few days to engage with Oir after you have time to read the actual documents . This certainly is not your last chance but I do want to encourage you to flag any issues publicly now in the spirit of wanting to keep our process as transparent as possible to members of the viewing public.",37,,
188,0.97,1654.552,1655.887,I see Councilmember Herbold has her hand up.,37,,
189,0.97,1655.887,1656.287,Please.,37,,
190,0.97,1656.287,1656.688,Thank you.,38,,
191,0.97,1656.688,1661.493,I'm interested in Flogging one of the items that Oir added to the draft legislative agenda on my request.,38,,
192,0.97,1661.493,1668.867,"It is pretty--from my understanding, in its infancy in developing the concept.",38,,
193,0.97,1668.867,1677.108,It is something that I know SPD is interested in.,38,,
194,0.97,1677.108,1680.679,It is a--it would be a new issue to be discussed at the state Legislature.,38,,
195,0.97,1680.679,1721.119,I think there is some precedent for a similar issue . that is that this is the issue related to that theft of catalytic Converters and the difficulty of doing anything around that locally and the precedent setting element here that relates specifically to how the state deals with copper wire theft . a lot of this is Preempted by this type of regulation of metal Recyclers.,38,,
196,0.97,1721.119,1725.156,It is Preempted in state law.,38,,
197,0.97,1725.156,1738.57,"Similarly, because the market for catalytic Converters are typically metal Recyclers, it has been determined that the ability of the city to do anything around this area is also Preempted by the state.",38,,
198,0.97,1738.57,1772.27,"As people know from reading about this in the media, there is also the issue that there is the Interstate Commerce issue in that the catalytic Converters are relatively small and they are not only being resold in local metal Recyclers but they are also being shipped . There is that issue there as well.",38,,
199,0.97,1772.27,1789.721,That obviously my need to be addressed another way but our own ability here locally to regulate scrap metal Recyclers in a way to try to address this issue is very hampered right now by state law.,38,,
200,0.97,1789.721,1806.838,"Just want to flag that the solution is not very well developed, unlike many times when we ask you to put something on the state legislative agenda.",38,,
201,0.97,1806.838,1809.107,There is already groups of folks who are working on it.,38,,
202,0.97,1809.107,1817.048,"This is one of those things where if we want to make some progress on it, we will need to put our heads together around some solutions.",38,,
203,0.97,1817.048,1819.15,Thank you.,38,,
204,0.97,1819.15,1821.085,Thank you so much for the context.,39,,
205,0.97,1821.085,1826.457,I did see Elsa was able to incorporate the language and we look forward to working with you and your staff and learning more about that issue.,39,,
206,0.97,1826.457,1835.834,"I would say generally, whether it is state Preemption on our ability to regulate firearms or things like this, we are generally seeking Morel authority to the regulatory work that the city would like to engage in.",39,,
207,0.97,1835.834,1838.67,Thank you so much for that flag.,39,,
208,0.97,1838.67,1839.871,Thank you for that.,40,,
209,0.97,1839.871,1844.742,Any comments or questions?,40,,

212,0.97,1848.58,1850.081,Going twice?,40,,
213,0.97,1850.081,1850.315,Okay.,40,,
214,0.97,1850.315,1852.884,I don't see any other hands raised.,40,,
215,0.97,1852.884,1861.893,"Lily, Elsa, Hannah, anything else you would like to add before we move on to our next item?",40,,
216,0.97,1861.893,1882.213,Just another note of Appreciation/Warning . It was so helpful to have you all engaged at the leadership level to the extent that you were last session and would really appreciate with our new team--we have some new faces.,41,,
217,0.97,1882.213,1884.849,It is always very powerful for legislators to hear from you directly.,41,,
218,0.97,1884.849,1894.592,We try to be judicious about what we are asking you to testify on but it really means a lot to policymakers in Olympia . I expect to hear from us.,41,,
219,0.97,1894.592,1901.699,We understand you are not always available but we do appreciate the partnership and just remember to pass the legislative agenda before session starts.,41,,
220,0.97,1901.699,1903.234,That would be my final word.,41,,

224,0.97,1910.241,1925.056,"We have given you our word to do that because that is your blueprint . When legislative session starts in the state, we will endeavor to get that across the finish line.",42,,
225,0.97,1925.056,1944.375,Thank you so much for being with us and good luck . I will not be here with you for your state legislative session next year but much luck to you all as you continue to do the hard and important work on behalf of the people of this city.,42,,
