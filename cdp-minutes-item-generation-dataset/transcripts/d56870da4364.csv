93,0.97,797.062,810.776,"In 2017, prior to passing the sugar, sweetened beverage tax, the city took the time to create a racial equity Toolkit.",28,,
94,0.97,810.843,818.35,The same should be done to App- based workers and community members before rush Ting pass it.,28,,
95,0.97,818.417,827.927,The Payup policy doesn't take into account the App-Based work and the negative unintended convinces that could come from the policies like Payup.,28,,
96,0.97,827.993,831.23,We believe there is a great opportunity in the right direction.,28,,

101,0.97,851.05,907.806,Amendment two would vastly expand the marketplace that would be able to offer On- demand for track workers and not pay Accordingly because they may do other things . amendment three would entire attempt the policy for continuing the access to jobs that would drive down pay . pay up has always covered the workers and covered in every hearing and every version of the policy since last year . whether we're talking about domestic workers or farm workers or good workers there is no good argument made to exclude anyone from minimum wage.,30,,

106,0.97,926.859,932.598,It's a crucial source of earning opportunities for thousands in Seattle.,32,,
107,0.97,932.665,945.21,This measure is considered without any effort from the city to study the impact including the possibility that it diminishes the opportunities it available to App-Based workers and number of delivery workers.,32,,
108,0.97,945.277,951.85,Flexibility is at the core of Shipt.,32,,

118,0.97,1001.133,1006.739,Workers are already in the dark as to how much the job will be paid.,34,,
119,0.97,1006.805,1010.976,Hiding the tips turn the lights off completely.,34,,
120,0.97,1011.043,1015.814,Here is the deal.,34,,
121,0.97,1015.881,1018.183,60% of the work is tips.,34,,
122,0.97,1018.25,1025.724,Tips is such a large portion of our total composition that we decide the jobs to accept based on it.,34,,
123,0.97,1025.791,1031.43,Every restaurant is required to pay the minimum wage before tips.,34,,
124,0.97,1031.497,1034.9,The gig companies must be held to the same standards.,34,,
125,0.97,1034.967,1039.271,It's the right for being workers to know the tip amount . tips are not wages.,34,,

132,0.97,1063.495,1078.577,Instacart is committed to providing shoppers the opportunity to earn how they want and when they want but in order for the opportunities to exist there must be sufficient customer demand.,36,,
133,0.97,1078.644,1081.146,And working conditions needs to factor that in.,36,,
134,0.97,1081.213,1094.159,"We appreciate the amendments that were introduced but think several adjustments need to be made for the impact on businesses, workers and the community.",36,,
135,0.97,1094.226,1099.465,The proposal is extremely problematic for shoppers and Pretail partners.,36,,
136,0.97,1099.531,1116.582,Members of the commit should be made aware that we expect a decrease in the offers on the platform that will in turn lead to a decrease in opportunity for workers and consumers . Instacart looks forward to further discussing as we continue to work.,36,,

147,0.97,1163.962,1171.503,They would use an excuse to pay drivers less keeping the profit for themselves.,40,,

151,0.97,1191.823,1203.268,The App wants time and mileage as it calculates the order ready for pick up.,40,,
152,0.97,1203.335,1213.712,This is a best guess.,40,,

331,0.97,2556.587,2571.735,"This is not specifically described in the ordinance, the treatment of complaints in the office of accountability, OPA, and they have found this to be warranted Thus the investigation.",85,,
332,0.97,2571.802,2597.227,It's haven't to create a process for the complaints because under current practice all complaints to OPA were left to the chief and the chief makes the final decision on investigative findings and imposition of any discipline . draft bill creates a role for the office of the inspector general or Oig which is independent from OPA.,85,,
333,0.97,2597.294,2643.707,"To create new rules for excuse me, Oig precedes a conflict of interest in that OPA is administratively housed went Seattle police Department . I will give an example of the Oig specific rule or complaints specifically when OPA received a complaint about an SPD employee, the staff formed a complaint intake and preliminary investigation . for a complaint that names the chief of police, the draft bill would have Oig review and have the opportunity to disagree with it.",85,,
334,0.97,2643.774,2652.249,"And if OPA and Oig disagree about that classification, then Oig's discrimination will stand.",85,,
335,0.97,2652.316,2659.223,This participation by Oig is consistent with the current oversight rule.,85,,
336,0.97,2659.289,2673.637,That ordinance also does not currently require that elected officials and accountability Stakeholders are kept apprised of investigations naming the chief of police.,85,,
337,0.97,2673.704,2744.475,"Including the Chunnel president and the public safety Committee, city attorney and executive director and chairs of the police Commission .

338,0.97,2744.541,2760.19,"Opa does not have a staff member to investigate the complaints, and specifically when they come in to OPA, OPA Consults with SPD human resources who does have a staff member.",85,,

368,0.97,2923.954,2927.724,We are joined by a number of Presenters today.,101,,
369,0.97,2927.791,2954.418,"I would like to ask that you introduce yourself with the Mayor's office and the neighborhood representatives, and Councilmember Nelson hosted with the city light committee some of the leaders of the districts which have a proposal.",101,,
370,0.97,2954.484,2957.421,We have invited them to share with us.,101,,
371,0.97,2957.487,2960.057,The presentation is linked to the agenda.,101,,
372,0.97,2960.123,3011.708,"At the same time, the Mayor's office has done great work to discuss issues in the neighborhood districts, issues related to the public safety challenges that they are dealing with in trying to design something tailored to individual experiences of public safety challenges . so far ICH also invited the Mayor's office to provide the update on the committee for the work that they are doing and before working to the demonstration, and with that, let's do a quick round of introductions.",101,,
373,0.97,3011.775,3019.85,Then I will hand it back over.,101,,
374,0.97,3019.916,3020.751,Hi.,102,,
375,0.97,3020.817,3024.388,Good morning.,102,,
376,0.97,3024.454,3029.226,"I am Eric Goodman, executive direct",102,,

379,0.97,3047.11,3047.611,Good morning.,105,,
380,0.97,3047.677,3058.288,"Quynh Pham, executive director of the friend of little Saigon.",105,,
381,0.97,3058.355,3058.522,Sorry.,106,,
382,0.97,3058.588,3063.16,I am Sam Wolff.,106,,
383,0.97,3063.226,3068.031,I am the project manager for the lead program.,106,,
384,0.97,3068.098,3072.803,And it look like safety director Myerberg is not to the screen.,107,,
385,0.97,3072.869,3082.145,I don't know if he is having difficulty getting in.,107,,
386,0.97,3082.212,3085.148,I know of this wasn't as we planned.,107,,
387,0.97,3085.215,3099.796,I know we had planned to have director Myerberg talk about the work with what lead is doing but are you prepared to do the whole thing?,107,,
388,0.97,3099.863,3100.564,Sure.,108,,
389,0.97,3100.63,3104.267,Do you want me to start now or do the slide --,108,,
390,0.97,3104.334,3115.045,I think we is going on before hearing from the business representatives about what more they would like it see done.,109,,
391,0.97,3115.111,3115.412,"Sure, sure.",110,,
392,0.97,3115.479,3118.548,"I am Sam, a project manager for the lead program.",110,,
393,0.97,3118.615,3149.079,"And we have been working with Andrew Myerberg the District doing case conferences about some public safety issues that the U district has Partnershipped with flag . basically, lead is a framework for figuring out what needs to be done in any given situation . We do this sort of case Conferencing on a regular basis in what we call operational work groups.",110,,
394,0.97,3149.145,3168.431,"This is primarily our case managers coming together with the Proscutorial liaison, and we can work on both of those things at the same time and make sure is that we are in sync.",110,,
395,0.97,3168.498,3175.705,"These operational work groups also include law enforcement, other service providers and community members.",110,,
396,0.97,3175.772,3191.955,The basic theory of the case Conferencing is to bring more partners to the table and align the members in complementary ways to achieve long-term change.,110,,
397,0.97,3192.022,3231.895,"We have additional partners at the table that allow the case Conferencing to address more needs and the U district partnership, and they with their outreach--and with their neighborhood connections, they have been able to create a list flags these situations and individual that is the neighborhood is seeing a lot or like are causing public safety issues for the community . Now, with that information, lead is able to kind of more accurately target the limited resources and Caseloads to work with individuals, and work would have the most positive impact on the community.",110,,
398,0.97,3231.962,3279.709,"So for anyone that is not familiar with lead, lead works specific he with people committing law violations with behavioral health issues such as substance disorder and we work with those folks and they have a Caseworker and we work with them to create behavior change, and this is a large task its things such as getting housing and legal income and people who need support especially because a lot of our clients are folks who have been without support or resources for many years.",110,,
399,0.97,3279.776,3282.145,This is where Andrew has stepped in.,110,,
400,0.97,3282.212,3291.855,"Again, this project in the U direct is in a very early stage.",110,,
401,0.97,3291.921,3311.374,We we have the community flags needs and we can help to stream line the process if anyone is ready to go inside and get the resources ready for them to more effectively and efficiently resolve the public safety concerns.,110,,
402,0.97,3311.441,3311.708,Yeah.,110,,
403,0.97,3311.775,3346.776,"I think we are pleased to have the additional partners involved in the process, and in general, this type of case Conferencing works best when all the players at the table are meaningfully engaged in the dialogue and we are pleased to be working with Andrew and the administration to build the framework to allow us to what needed to be done and very early stages but hoping to Replicate it elsewhere and figure out what we need to do to make it work better.",110,,
404,0.97,3346.843,3347.11,I'm sorry.,111,,
405,0.97,3347.177,3354.317,"I am Chiming in late but thank you, Sam, for setting the table for that.",111,,
406,0.97,3354.384,3365.862,"But just to provide more detail how this came to be and some of the why as to why we are doing this, and everything Sam said is totally right.",111,,
407,0.97,3365.929,3369.165,Where this came from is really early on.,111,,
408,0.97,3369.232,3391.488,"And when I joined the administration, the Harrell administration we went for a walk through for the U district and Councilmember Nelson was there and Councilmember Pedersen was there, and they put this together and there was significantly public safety impacts specifically on neighborhoods and business districts.",111,,
409,0.97,3391.554,3411.708,"When we started to pull date and heat maps of crime we saw crime was correlating in the neighborhoods as well so the U direct, Pioneer square, Sodo, and Cibdia, that's where the data shows.",111,,
410,0.97,3411.775,3441.07,"The concept behind the work was to take a model that we thought was productive, the operational work group model that Lee uses to move to a neighborhood focus as opposed to a precinct focus . one of the reason yes yesterday we wanted to do that is since 2020, we have been out of practice, and we are stretched really thin and participation in the work groups is not as robust as in the past.",111,,
411,0.97,3441.137,3458.421,"So was there a way to focus on what is the biggest impact and get a Communit voice to hear directly from the people on the ground which is in a lot of the cases, the business organizations, the Businesss and community members that they represent as to what the impacts are.",111,,
412,0.97,3458.488,3466.629,The U district was an interesting place to start . a lot of what they were seeing was crisis oriented.,111,,
413,0.97,3466.696,3475.839,"There were crimes, certainly Shoplift and drug use and a lot was than opposed to higher- level crime.",111,,
414,0.97,3475.905,3481.511,There was that there but that's what we were seeing in the U district predominantly.,111,,
415,0.97,3481.578,3490.787,We felt this was a good set of behaviors to bring lead to . So the first step--let me back up too.,111,,
416,0.97,3490.854,3502.232,"I think what we realized is with the current resources, there is no way to address these issues if you don't do it Holistically.",111,,
417,0.97,3502.298,3518.381,We Dente don't have enough police officers if you wanted to make arrests and arresting people for particularly low-level misdemeanor crimes and not repeat misdemeanor crimes I am not sure that will affect the underlying behavior.,111,,
418,0.97,3518.448,3551.814,"So could we go in there and engage and work with lead and get people into shelters and get the case plans and thus try and eliminate the conditions caution the activity and not only remove people from the shelters and allow law enforcement to focus the Already-Limited resources on predatory, drug dealers that are targeting people that are more vulnerable and again, that was the purpose of doing this work.",111,,
419,0.97,3551.881,3581.277,"The first step when we worked out the program was to work with the bi as to develop the list of public safety impact, and I want to kick this over quickly to don because ton and his Multifaceted team did a program amount of work to develop the left and if you could spend a minute or two talking through how you do that and what the list looked like and the size of the list, that would be helpful.",111,,
420,0.97,3581.344,3581.811,"Thank you, Andrew.",112,,
421,0.97,3581.878,3602.265,"For the past two years we have been fortunate to have the city support for the outreach of homeless in the neighborhoods, and the neighborhoods that have been experiencing homelessness in the last two years and we do a monthly census, and it has grown to 150 Overtimes.",112,,
422,0.97,3602.332,3618.348,And we have safety ambassadors that we have in your neighborhood who are unarmed and they walk around and provide a visual presence and tell people how to find the U- Dub campus.,112,,
423,0.97,3618.414,3630.96,It's not too complicated with those entities and stake hold Iners general we get a lot of information about what is going on.,112,,
424,0.97,3631.027,3644.54,"We hear from small Businesss that their windows have been broken two times in the past few months, and then the ambassadors have the information and outreach has the information and is able to bring that together.",112,,
425,0.97,3644.607,3650.146,And we found there was no place to put this information forward as a community.,112,,
426,0.97,3650.213,3681.677,"So we started convening a small conversation with us internally about what we are seeing here and some individuals were having a large impact in the community but there was not anyone flagging that saying Why don't we dive in on this particular individual having a behavioral health crisis or, and we started talking with lead and the outreach program under our organization that works for the program.",112,,
427,0.97,3681.744,3687.884,And we were able to take that information and start problem solving.,112,,
428,0.97,3687.95,3743.906,"You know, I don't have a Masters in social work but the folks around the table that do were able to provide creative solutions into temporary housing and Reconnect people with the host program and we had people with severe mental health issues and their case manager had lost track of them and we were able to get them back on the path and they got housing, and it was that problem Salving, and so what Andrew is striking is coming in and trying to grab the loose ends and connect the dots . The list that we are putting together is compounding issues from different corners of our community and trying to problem solve, about what--if this is the highest impact of individuals what could be done? is this person operating in a criminal enterprise that we have to bring in the law enforcement and city attorney on?",112,,
429,0.97,3743.973,3754.083,"But it's that kind of trouble shooting that helps to problem solve the high impact issue . and that's the background on the list, Andrew.",112,,
430,0.97,3754.15,3773.936,"It is the U was a unique place to start with the outreach and the workers there, so it definitely made our casework easier . Once the lists were developed, we convened the group.",113,,
431,0.97,3774.003,3787.617,"We have two active groups . We have the U district and Sodo are active, and we are working with Ballard right now to finalize their list before starting up the meetings, and then we are setting the table.",113,,
432,0.97,3787.683,3790.453,Who's going to be at these meetings?,113,,
433,0.97,3790.52,3794.957,"For now, the Mayor's office, lead, reach, SPD.",113,,
434,0.97,3795.024,3807.87,We's had representatives from the King County regional homeless authority and hope . and I think we are trying to figure out what the balance is and Councilmember Strauss has been involved and the group in Ballard.,113,,
435,0.97,3807.937,3833.563,"We are trying to figure out the right balance of what should be there and who should there in what role and what works and what doesn't, and we go through the list and realistically, between five and six people are what we will get through and discuss what are the impacts and what are the needs of this person?",113,,
436,0.97,3833.629,3840.97,"Are they already involved in services, and so, what services?",113,,
437,0.97,3841.037,3847.243,And are they lead eligible? and create a plan for each person to go through.,113,,
438,0.97,3847.31,3859.121,"To be honest, the plan to be long-term and create a dialogue and try and get the person to seek drug treatment to get them into housing.",113,,
439,0.97,3859.188,3870.499,We may have a person who is eligibility for a tiny home and move up that request to get them into shelter.,113,,
440,0.97,3870.566,3873.769,I have learned this is not fast.,113,,
441,0.97,3873.836,3880.576,It's slow because people want to need to accept services and want to need to be part of this to move out and change behavior.,113,,
442,0.97,3880.643,3910.273,"That's the work that we are doing, and a person is not lead eligible which is the case we discuss whether law enforcement intervention is needed and so, what that is going to be and Ideally, you would never have that situation but you know there will be times where people will be subject to arrest specifically, the behavior is, you know, targeting other folks and more vulnerable people.",113,,
443,0.97,3910.339,3926.789,"We are in the U district and Sodo and Ballard and we are working with neighborhoods to start building out their lists and on our list of potentials, West Seattle, Columbia city, Mount Baker, Georgetown, and North Lake.",113,,
444,0.97,3926.856,3933.729,"Those are all kind of in the mix as next step, and I know Councilmember Lewis has his hand up.",113,,
445,0.97,3933.796,3947.843,"But I will say we have a couple questions that have come out of this that I am happy to go through and we need to answer . Councilmember Lewis, do you want to pop in and I can --",113,,
446,0.97,3947.91,3948.344,Yes.,114,,
447,0.97,3948.411,3949.445,All good.,115,,
448,0.97,3949.512,3951.213,All good.,115,,
449,0.97,3951.28,3955.151,We are all family here.,115,,
450,0.97,3955.217,3978.708,Really appreciate you describing the executive approach and your willingness to Replicate the model and recognizing that each neighborhood is different and has different challenges . I recognize Councilmember Lewis and I want to thank you for your earlier discussions with the West Seattle Chamber . I'm sorry.,115,,
451,0.97,3978.774,3991.721,The junction Bia as well as conversations that you've had with Southwest district coordinator.,115,,
452,0.97,3991.787,3994.256,Rally appreciate early conversations.,115,,
453,0.97,3994.323,3994.724,Councilmember Lewis?,115,,
454,0.97,3994.79,4010.506,Thank you Herbold and director Myerberg for joining us for this discussion and definitely echo the chair's comments about appreciating the collaboration and access and problem solving that this administration has shown around the issues.,116,,
455,0.97,4010.573,4024.854,"That has not always been the case historically, and it's good to be here and really have that kind of collaboration . You know, I--I think that it's really centering what the bottleneck issues are.",116,,
456,0.97,4024.92,4038.234,I know that you didn't mean this in your comments just now about kind of building the rapport to get people in place where they are ready to accept services.,116,,
457,0.97,4038.3,4043.139,I don't know that service resistance is the primary issue that we are facing.,116,,
458,0.97,4043.205,4054.617,I think it's more adequate capacity and supply where we have people on a regular basis want to go if that can be offered.,116,,
459,0.97,4054.683,4059.722,"And again, I know that you know that.",116,,
460,0.97,4059.789,4061.724,I am not asking for clarification.,116,,
461,0.97,4061.791,4074.236,But we have this discussion here with great partners in the Bia working closely with folks like lead and reach and working with programs like that.,116,,
462,0.97,4074.303,4115.344,"And it really considered to me that part of this exercise for the city should really be how you can carve out dedicated cares in business districts throughout the city with, you know, dedicated capacity for people doing the work in the neighborhood like the U district just care Hub, a Ballard just care Hub, a Columbia city just care Hub so you know, in each of those places, there can be the constant work and outreach that is connected to a place that people can go.",116,,
463,0.97,4115.411,4135.898,"You know, I think that we constantly have sort of a mindset that there will be an easy or cheaper or more expedient way to develop a novel new method of outreach to deal with the high security issues we have seen in the U district.",116,,
464,0.97,4135.965,4251.113,"The thing that I have seen work is if you have a well Resourced place to take somebody to get them off the street and get them the wrap around resources that they need, and that fundamentally makes progress on the places we are making . We need to own and embrace that and be together through my committee or Councilmember Herbold's committee, a way to fill the needs, a way to meet the needs and be honest about the cost and work together to make sacrifices and meet that cost so that we can get past which is, without a doubt, the biggest issue in the city . It's public health crisis that the criminal legal system is Incapability of solving the problems of and shows that again and again and again, and we know there are effective public health interventions and outreach methods that do mitigate and solve the problem . and that's the conversation that we are having and we are having it but we need it more Online and here and bring along Stakeholders with us, and we talk about police staffing and we should, and it's necessary but not efficient for the crisis we are facing and we need to dedicate more bandwidth for this that we are acknowledging, and there are statements in there that are flagging my interest in working with you and the people in the room on this but I think we need to take that on and with the urgency that we are accepting because it's detrimental to the quality of life.",116,,
465,0.97,4251.18,4251.413,Thank you.,116,,
466,0.97,4251.48,4262.124,I think really completely concur is one thing we see in the work and it was clear in the U district work is the systemic Apps.,117,,
467,0.97,4262.191,4310.973,"We had a person the other day that had a Tbi and psychotic episodes, and I'm sure there is but we could not think of a shelter that we could place an individual in at this point to get them out of the U district . So those are the systemic gaps . I agree with you, and thank you for the clarification, and something that came up in the Sodo meeting yesterday is you do have individuals and it's a large part of our State and there are not services that they feel comfortable with but lead struggles at time as did reach to try and find people and to be part of the system . So we--we see both problems and try and work through both problems.",117,,
468,0.97,4311.04,4313.342,"Thank you, Mr.",118,,
469,0.97,4313.409,4313.909,Councilmember Lewis.,118,,
470,0.97,4313.976,4367.73,"Before I turn it over to Councilmember Nelson I want to say that my intent in setting the table this way was to, again, both hear about what we're doing now but also hear from the folks that you're Weeing with, director Myerberg, and Sam and folks that you are not yet working with to talk about what more could be done . So a lot of appreciation for the work you are doing and recognition that you are doing it in a way that is more collaborative and focusing on the underlying conditions with the quality of life impact and the crime that has the impact on victims.",118,,
471,0.97,4367.796,4381.076,"So really, really appreciate that, and want to after Councilmember Nelson's questions or comments that over to hear from the neighborhood business district representative.",118,,
472,0.97,4381.143,4381.677,Councilmeber Nelson?,118,,
473,0.97,4381.744,4382.177,Thank you very much.,119,,
474,0.97,4382.244,4402.865,"So I can take this question Offline but for the people that are not lead eligibility, are you working or will you plan on working with the city attorney's office, the King County Prosecutor'S office to address those issues that fall beyond --",119,,
475,0.97,4402.931,4430.926,"Yeah, Yeah there some--there will be connections with the high utilized--it's not just high Utilizers But everyone causing the public safety impact--well, not everyone, but the ideal situation is we are not arresting any of these people . that's ideal.",120,,
476,0.97,4430.993,4431.727,Right?,120,,
477,0.97,4431.794,4432.761,"But, yes.",120,,
478,0.97,4432.828,4446.442,"We will be collaborating with them and just before I stop talking, I wanted to thank you, Councilmember Herbold, for having us here and Councilmember Nelson, I am happy to talk about this Offline.",120,,
479,0.97,4446.508,4449.444,And I wanted to talk about what you said.,120,,
480,0.97,4449.511,4460.455,"This work is only a tiny portion of the U direct and what the other bias today were asking for, and that's in their proposal, and I want to be clear about that.",120,,
481,0.97,4460.522,4467.095,"While this does address some of the occurrence, it doesn't address everything.",120,,
482,0.97,4467.162,4475.704,"And part of the work that we are doing is to understand do, we need more budget, for example, for the community Hub Coordinators?",120,,
483,0.97,4475.771,4486.448,"Like is there a business case to be made this these things? and that's our process, and I am cede over to them but thank you for having us.",120,,
484,0.97,4486.515,4487.182,Great conversation.,121,,
485,0.97,4487.249,4488.617,Thank you so much.,121,,
486,0.97,4488.684,4506.268,So who--it looks like Eric is ready to go.,121,,
487,0.97,4506.335,4511.807,Thank you so much.,122,,
488,0.97,4511.874,4512.608,Eric good man.,122,,
489,0.97,4512.674,4516.211,We representative the neighborhood district.,122,,
490,0.97,4516.278,4539.735,"Some of us bias and others are different organizations but the heart of what we do is allowing people to focus on running basis, and really, over the last few years, that support has increasingly been related to public safety issues.",122,,
491,0.97,4539.801,4542.271,And also increased significantly with the pandemic.,122,,
492,0.97,4542.337,4577.773,"So what we are presenting today and the Councilmembers we will outline the extended relationship between public safety and economic recovery . When we told her the issues that our businesses were dealing with, and the evil we had taken on to support them, sometimes, we are detectives with the Coordinators and victim support and more, and now help us understand so we can put your position on the ground and work with the businesses.",122,,
493,0.97,4577.839,4582.477,What could come out of this that you think would be helpful?,122,,
494,0.97,4582.544,4587.282,"And so we have, you know, put this work together.",122,,
495,0.97,4587.349,4603.165,"We have presented it to Council and Councilmember Nelson's economic development, and we were accompanied by business owners across the city who shared their experience and concerns and the impact of the public safety issue.",122,,
496,0.97,4603.231,4636.164,"Since that meeting we met with individual Councilmembers, representatives from the Mayor's office to discuss the proposals in detail, and through that conversation, we refined the proposal to address the questions raised during the meeting and to further, you know, address sort of how this works in relationship to the system we currently have . It's important to state that we are absolutely supportive of and advocate for an Appropriately-Staffed police Department.",122,,
497,0.97,4636.231,4653.315,"And the work we are presenting today is designed to complement the work of sworn officers and provide civilian answers to the problems Plaguing our district W. that, I will turn it over to Quynh.",122,,
498,0.97,4653.382,4655.817,"Thank you, us off.",123,,
499,0.97,4655.884,4656.284,And thank you.,123,,
500,0.97,4656.351,4663.592,And I really appreciate the time to be able to speak on the proposal today.,123,,
501,0.97,4663.658,4674.369,We came out with an Op-Ed just a couple of minutes ago to highlight some of our work . and Erin did talk about some of our issues that we're dealing with.,123,,
502,0.97,4674.436,4679.941,"So, are you continuing the slides?",123,,
503,0.97,4680.008,4681.043,We'll go to seven.,123,,
504,0.97,4681.109,4711.44,"Some of the major impacts on the neighborhoods as you have heard throughout the conversation is threatening behaviors, vandalism, broken windows, violence, Apes, and rapes, and arson and many violence behaviors in the neighborhood.",123,,
505,0.97,4711.506,4719.881,"And Andrew Myerberg addressed the precinct level, and this is not an appropriate scale to highly our issues.",123,,
506,0.97,4719.948,4739.401,"And in North Seattle, there are diverse neighborhoods and needs from Ballard to North Aurora . We in the Cid have experienced little Saigon before recently, we were part of the South precinct.",123,,
507,0.97,4739.468,4747.976,We were just recently enrolled into the North precinct.,123,,
508,0.97,4748.043,4764.926,"For example, we no longer have neighborhood foot patrols and community police teams and Anti- crime teams and precinct detectives.",123,,
509,0.97,4764.993,4779.875,So the focus should be on neighborhoods and then this one highlights the proposed programs that we have been talking to you all about the last couple months.,123,,
510,0.97,4779.941,4799.427,We initially--so the first one is really a dedicated Mayor's office role to oversee community safety with the current director and next is a team of dedicated community Hub Coordinators.,123,,
511,0.97,4799.494,4819.714,"This was mentioned earlier . Currently, the community partners are playing this role because we are not able to do other work, and even director Marberg is taking on some of this work, and so we need to--we need more capacity to do this.",123,,
512,0.97,4819.781,4838.066,"And then, of course, high visibility civilian staff foot patrol and neighborhood crisis response and neighborhood behavioral health outreach at the neighborhood level.",123,,
513,0.97,4838.133,4848.643,And I'll hand it over to don.,123,,
514,0.97,4849.01,4849.144,Sorry.,124,,
515,0.97,4849.211,4851.713,Couldn't Unmute.,125,,
516,0.97,4851.78,4857.452,So what we wanted to do is map out what it looks like in a given neighborhood.,125,,
517,0.97,4857.519,4874.97,"Let's take a neighborhood like little Saigon and you saw the issues that Andrew Myerberg was talking about earlier, major vandalism, behavioral health disruptions, and violence, and you see that usually in a business district.",125,,
518,0.97,4875.036,4899.094,"Currently we have resources the districts that like a Bia . Sometimes, we have services that are located in that neighborhood but a lot of the stuff that usually comes together or Basketballing up is citywide or precinct wide as we were discussing.",125,,
519,0.97,4899.16,4920.949,"What we were proposing is on the last slide, and this is proposed to the mix to take the community out of the Hub and put them as a partner to the table but have city employees that are connected to all the agencies and entities to hold together and connect the dots for the issues as they pop up in the geographic areas.",125,,
520,0.97,4921.016,4994.723,"You can see the Hub coordinator is at the center of the coordinator and you have them understand what is dog in the neighborhood and they can rely their knowledge with a Non-Spd response or community with the neighborhood outreach with people who are experiencing homelessness or behavioral health issues the District on the ground, and then the businesses that were impacted and what's going on and what the plan is at an appropriate level of information so people understand It's not in a vacuum but there are community members coming together and working to problem solve on issues that are extremely Impactful in the community, and also like we were talking about with Councilmember Nelson's question, there are also folks who are not on the behavioral health side but on the criminal enterprise side and working with the King County Prosecutor and the city attorney and SPD, trouble shoot to figure out how are the chronic issues, enterprises Impacting the neighborhood.",125,,
521,0.97,4994.789,4997.926,You can see the role that this person would play.,125,,
522,0.97,4997.992,5010.271,"You know, they would convene like we were talking about an operational work group or safety task force to really engage with all of these different entities.",125,,
523,0.97,5010.338,5016.044,They would provide that Intraagency coordination outside of the meetings so between the internal and external City resources.,125,,
524,0.97,5016.111,5044.706,"They would help to manage the High-Impact list of the folks having the largest impact on the neighborhood and take that from different bodies and help the work group kind of manage the strategies of kind of working through that list and finding solutions for folks . Also, they would do something that doesn't currently exist which I think is extremely important and that is following up in Stakeholders who have been impacted and helping them to understand the context of the situation.",125,,
525,0.97,5044.773,5063.992,"Right now, you could be a small business and someone could come by and harass your customers and you ask them to leave and they have animosity and come back and break your windy--windows.",125,,
526,0.97,5064.058,5071.866,And you are just a target . Andis at a high level.,125,,
527,0.97,5071.933,5103.998,"I step back and describe this apparatus, and it's focusing on the areas of the cities that the highest impacted by the crime or behavioral health issues, and it's Prioritizing and putting energy into resolving the issues with the greatest impact in the neighborhoods and Scaling the communication and problem solving at the communication level instead of the precinct level so folks can participate in the discussion and there are resources to manage that discussion and problem solving overtime.",125,,
528,0.97,5104.065,5114.008,"And this Coordinational problem solving is the best practice, and it's currently living in the bias of the commercial district that is not sustainable.",125,,
529,0.97,5114.075,5143.905,"And we are excited to be working with director Myerberg on this too, and having him manage the conversations wasn't sustainable, either so we are excited to see what this conversation could look like in this neighborhood and I would like to acknowledge these are not the only solutions that we are talking about, but there are a few other Strategys that we have been talking about, and I wanted to ask Monisha to talk about some of the strategies.",125,,
530,0.97,5143.972,5146.341,"Thank you, don.",126,,
531,0.97,5146.407,5203.798,"So in addition, we have highlighted a few additional strategies to complement this . The first thing, a broken window in a storefront, several of our neighborhoods are already experimenting with this including Cid in Pioneer square, and in particular Tcid has had significant issues for the costs of repair in historic buildings from the amounts of $500 to $5,000 which can go a long way in a small business . and in addition, we wanted to be expanding this to include graffiti with the historic masonry and the cost to cover and clean up graffiti is significant especially with the small businesses and it leads us to the second point of the small business experience Affordability.",126,,
532,0.97,5203.865,5221.683,We have heard from several businesses that the insurance Affordability and the ability to stay insured has been significant and many of you are businesses in the Cid are under insured.,126,,
533,0.97,5221.749,5227.288,And a lot of our businesses are having a hard time to continue to stay insured.,126,,
534,0.97,5227.355,5235.296,The third we wanted to highlight the technology systems to report Non-Emergency issues.,126,,
535,0.97,5235.363,5249.944,I heard Councilmember Nelson and Mayor Harrell have supported this type of technology where folks could report Online.,126,,
536,0.97,5250.011,5267.629,"We have heard from our businesses especially from the Cid who have language capacity issues or technology access issues that filing a report Online is often hindering . and Lastly, we wanted to pilot the community capacity building.",126,,
537,0.97,5267.695,5287.715,"I wanted to point out friends of little Saigon is not a business improvement, so there are certain communities that, for example, the office of economic development could support organizations like that and support their business district.",126,,
538,0.97,5287.782,5295.523,That's it and I will take you back to Dofnlt don.,126,,
539,0.97,5295.59,5296.024,Thank you.,126,,
540,0.97,5296.09,5341.903,"I will take a know, when we are looking at these items, we have appreciated that we had the opportunities to bring them to you today and we appreciate the ongoing conversation with the Mayor's office, and it's you are understanding that some of the items are in process sore--or some of the resources and I did want to acknowledge that . and we are ready, we are ready to take questions.",127,,
541,0.97,5341.969,5360.288,"Again, appreciate you highlights the elements of the collaborative approach that are missing or at capacity and appreciate the role that director Myerberg is playing right now to keep this collaboration afloat.",128,,
542,0.97,5360.354,5365.693,Just curious--I see Councilmember Lewis you have your hand up.,128,,
543,0.97,5365.76,5388.416,"And just curious recognizing that resources will continue to be an issue even should we look at funding a community Hub organizing approach, and it's unlikely that we will do it to such a scale that we will be able to have those engagements in every neighborhood that needs it simultaneously.",128,,
544,0.97,5388.483,5395.823,There will have to be some Prioritization I think I heard you say.,128,,
545,0.97,5395.89,5412.473,And I am just wondering how you propose that neighborhood by neighborhood Prioritization formula or analysis?,128,,
546,0.97,5412.54,5429.624,"We hear from folks that they don't thank prime data, that that a Sloan a finish source . happy to hear from you.",128,,
547,0.97,5429.69,5465.793,"And that's a you know, resources are not abundant for new things but I would say we try to be smart where we put our energy and places where we put an extreme impact, and how it was compounded after the recession where the commercial districts were, and looking at the economic and safety Metrics, I think crime Stats are a great year over year thing to look at.",129,,
548,0.97,5465.86,5467.161,But it's not complete as you said.,129,,
549,0.97,5467.228,5480.808,I think looking at the economic impact there is work we could do to look at the impacts we are doing to kind of establish the need for this type of work but I do think it's more than one team.,129,,
550,0.97,5480.875,5484.045,I think in the past we have seen issues bubble over.,129,,
551,0.97,5484.111,5494.055,"And the city is responsive with what is technically interdepartmental, and we saw this in little Saigon.",129,,
552,0.97,5494.121,5495.556,But it's not the norm.,129,,
553,0.97,5495.623,5499.861,We are not set up to do that on a repeated basis.,129,,
554,0.97,5499.927,5511.706,I think maybe there is 5 to 10 of these Apparatuses that focus in on the areas that are the hottest and figure out the solution There's and hopefully able to move on.,129,,
555,0.97,5511.772,5516.911,In the U district you have 25 folks with a big impact and Sodo at six.,129,,
556,0.97,5516.978,5539.233,"And once we get an idea or a plan to work with a handful of individuals in the neighborhoods that don't have as much of an impact we can move on, and we need to consider equity, and what Quynh and Monisha was talking about is how can we do that with the limited funding.",129,,
557,0.97,5539.3,5539.7,"Thank you, don.",130,,
558,0.97,5539.767,5563.758,"One of the things to add is part of the goal of the Hub community coordinator is we had an individual on the street that was bouncing between Pioneer and Sodo for eight years and the amount of resources that have gone into that individual, whether behavioral resources or other needs on the street is already pretty high.",131,,
559,0.97,5563.824,5579.44,"Part of this is if we are able to follow the common issues, there will be--we will be working towards neighbor several changes overtime because of the impact within that work area.",131,,
560,0.97,5579.507,5579.874,All right.,132,,
561,0.97,5579.941,5581.909,Thank you.,132,,
562,0.97,5581.976,5583.978,Councilmember Lewis and then Councilmember Nelson?,132,,
563,0.97,5584.045,5589.784,"Thank you so much, chair, and thank you for the presentation.",133,,
564,0.97,5589.85,5593.854,I've had the opportunity to be briefed individually on the recommendation as well.,133,,
565,0.97,5593.921,5603.731,I think they are creative and things that warrant the consideration of the Council and the city family.,133,,
566,0.97,5603.798,5688.516,"One thing I want to Re- emphasize is I appreciate in the four corners of the presentation is the willingness with the current response options, and what I would like to see going forward is if we can work together to amplify the message and to really promote that publically with the same level of enthusiasm that we typically see from the business community for police staffing which again which I said with agreement on this committee as we will demonstrate this afternoon and we demonstrated two weeks ago to increase the effort efforts to meet the crisis in staffing with the police Department . I think what is missed in the public narrative is the discussion about alternatives that isn't getting put forth enough, and I am not betraying a confident to say that, you know, Mike has made it a mission of his to say that the changes need to be bargained, and there doesn't seem to be much enthusiasm, and given the relationship--from the policing, given the relationship that the people at the table have with law enforcement, with people who are concerned about possible safety, I think your voice is critical through this conversation.",133,,
567,0.97,5688.582,5731.225,"And we would like to be partners with you in pushing this discussion on alternatives and building public support for it, and one thing I would leave folks with, too, the response from the panel members if they think this is a place to look at, even something as simple as traffic direction, 7 There00,000 of overtime hours for guns and badges to direct traffic, 7600 overtime service hours spent on that TCT activity does doesn't require a gun and badge.",133,,
568,0.97,5731.292,5769.563,"I would much rather have them walking a beat or working on burglary improvement in these areas, and we are making a policy choice to have 7600 staffing hours dedicated to directing traffic for no reason given that parking enforcement officers are qualified to do that work and do do that . I had a great interview Congresswoman Bush who representatives St. Louis, Missouri and 800 calls for a pilot clinical alternative program.",133,,
569,0.97,5769.63,5779.44,They freed up 2000 police service hours that they could spend dedicated to law enforcement and gun and badge activities.,133,,
570,0.97,5779.507,5814.909,"I would like to say that we are in a staffing crisis with police and likely to be in a staffing cries for a while we are making policy choices to have gun and badge jobs do things they should not be doing and doing things only they can do, and this group of great community leaders who do effective work, representing the Ratepayers I would love to partner and work with you to drive that conversation as well.",133,,
571,0.97,5814.975,5818.579,"It's essential and important, and just focusing on this is not enough.",133,,
572,0.97,5818.646,5840.634,"We have so explain to the greatest impact to make the community safer, and I wanted to highlight this is emphasized in the presentation and going forward if we can emphasize that more, too, and in our collaboration in driving some of the policies.",133,,
573,0.97,5840.701,5843.404,"Thank you, Lewis.",134,,
574,0.97,5843.47,5844.004,Councilmember Nelson?,134,,
575,0.97,5844.071,5855.95,"When you were neighborhood coordinator what was was in my mind was the neighborhood district Coordinators, you know.",135,,
576,0.97,5856.016,5871.332,They are still different functions but there is a vacuum on what is going on in the neighborhood and in the city . and I endorse this model and look forward to working with my colleagues.,135,,
577,0.97,5871.398,5871.799,"So, yes.",135,,
578,0.97,5871.865,5903.397,"Taking the advice of the representatives of small businesses across the city and putting something in place that they have thought about for a long time and on the list of recommendations, my top priority only because it seems like it might be the easiest is the storefront restoration, broken windows, broken storefronts, et cetera.",135,,
579,0.97,5903.464,5915.943,So that continues to be a high priority for me and the Mayor's office.,135,,
580,0.97,5916.01,5931.859,"The insurance study would make--I have spoken with the interim director of Oed, and now we are down to an issue of resources and resources for a study of what I like to call a gap analysis.",135,,

582,0.97,5935.796,5946.473,"Small businesses--it's difficult to get a policy or for they report crimes f they have a claim, then their rates go up.",135,,
583,0.97,5946.54,5967.961,"I think it's important to quantify that, and I am focused on spending resources on things that have an independent impact but I'm open to further bring that and then in finding the technology, trying to fix it . It's important to record this conversation.",135,,
584,0.97,5968.028,5970.264,I am glad to see that is still in the mix.,135,,
585,0.97,5970.331,5979.84,You want an access way to record what's happening and that would help the city to respond better.,135,,
586,0.97,5979.907,6023.717,"Thank you so much, Councilmember Nelson, your leadership in terms of restoration and I want to note that prior to Covid the office of Exno you can development had a neighborhood business stabilization Fund and they transferred that fund to be more of a Covid relief Fund . But it was specifically designed to deal with mitigating business impacts either from unexpected activities like crime but also impacts with city projects that may have an impact on reduced business activity.",136,,
587,0.97,6023.784,6034.561,So hope that we can make look to leadership working with Oeb to restore that fund INS it original purpose.,136,,

598,0.97,6139.8,6167.094,"In terms of the Hub coordinator concept, it's a function that it doesn't really do right now but what if the city were to--just as we supply or subsidize outreach workers through Bia, why not Cothat through the bias instead of creating a new city government employee classification?",139,,
599,0.97,6167.16,6178.972,"I am just worried about how long that might take to do . In other words, to have it still done by the Bia and have the funding come from the city government.",139,,

658,0.97,6790.817,6811.037,"Thank you, chair in terms of the tip before the Facilitation, so if you are a consumer, you need to tip someone before you provide the service?",164,,
659,0.97,6811.104,6815.375,Why would you do that before the service is provided?,164,,
660,0.97,6815.441,6819.646,I just want to that logic . Thank you.,164,,
661,0.97,6819.712,6821.181,Go ahead.,165,,
662,0.97,6821.247,6822.582,"You go first, Amy.",166,,
663,0.97,6822.649,6835.695,Some companies do customer to put the tip amount before the offer is basically presented to the worker.,167,,
664,0.97,6835.762,6838.531,It's just the first kind of passive information.,167,,
665,0.97,6838.598,6854.614,"So the current bill would require if the customer provides that before the work is done, the worker would be alerted---",167,,
666,0.97,6854.681,6857.217,With the additional tip at the end.,168,,
667,0.97,6857.283,6857.717,Yes.,169,,
668,0.97,6857.784,6860.153,Can I follow,170,,
669,0.97,6860.22,6862.522,Yes.,171,,
670,0.97,6862.589,6863.723,Absolutely.,171,,
671,0.97,6863.79,6888.314,"So then, customers -It's if the customer chooses to provide that up front, the information will be provided to the worker, but there is no requirement to provide the tip up front, and it doesn't prohibit them from tipping something later . So you could--so if you are a customer, you could be saying why would I tip?",172,,
672,0.97,6888.381,6890.883,I haven't gotten the service yet?,172,,
673,0.97,6890.95,6896.289,So you put zero in for now and you get great service and you tip them at the end.,172,,
674,0.97,6896.356,6907.9,"But if you choose to tip something in advance, that information must be passed through to a worker before they accept the job.",172,,
675,0.97,6907.967,6909.135,Is that right?,172,,
676,0.97,6909.202,6911.804,That is my exact understanding of the intent . Thank you.,173,,
677,0.97,6911.871,6913.873,Okay.,174,,

679,0.97,6915.775,6918.311,Anything to add?,175,,
680,0.97,6918.378,6923.85,I would just add that not all Apps allow Up- front tipping.,176,,
681,0.97,6923.916,6933.76,"If the App does and if a customer chooses to do it up front, then the worker would be--they would be required to do all that up front.",176,,

692,0.97,6964.724,6964.891,Yes.,185,,
693,0.97,6964.957,6966.059,Chair Herbold?,186,,
694,0.97,6966.125,6966.292,Yes.,187,,
695,0.97,6966.359,6970.229,I've in favor and opposed.,188,,
696,0.97,6970.296,6971.731,Please describe number two.,189,,
697,0.97,6971.798,6979.105,"The next consideration is amendment two, version one and sponsored by Councilmember Pedersen.",190,,
698,0.97,6979.172,6984.11,This would change the definition of marketplace network company.,190,,
699,0.97,6984.177,6989.515,The current bill would define using two criteria.,190,,
700,0.97,6989.582,7014.941,"The companies are exclusively engaged in facilitating Pre- scheduled offer in which the customer and worker negotiate the offer, scope, and cost before the customer places the order and the worker ACCEPTS . of the second criteria is the companies exclusively facilitate services without monitoring offers by geographic location or time.",190,,
701,0.97,7015.007,7057.85,"So it would change the marketplace company to have three criteria Y first that a marketplace network company is primarily engaged in facilitating offers that enables the platform and customer to exchange information on the offer, scope, and cost before the customer places the order and the worker ACCEPTS and the second criteria Y the worker SETS their own rate and the third is the network will not monitor offer and time, and moves the geographic location that is currently in the bill . the use of primarily engaged rather than exclusively engaged gives the marketplace companies more flexibility in their operation.",190,,
702,0.97,7057.917,7063.923,"For example while they offer Pre-Scheduled work, work that will begin where the offer--I'm sorry.",190,,
703,0.97,7063.99,7078.738,"Where the worker will begin work within longer than two hours instead, this would allow them to sometimes do what we call On-Demand work which is within two hours.",190,,
704,0.97,7078.805,7095.087,The amendment would allow the office of labor standards to find out what primarily dug would be be engaged and apply . with that over to Councilmember Pedersen.,190,,
705,0.97,7095.154,7095.455,Thank you.,191,,
706,0.97,7095.521,7103.83,I want to thank the staff for their hard work on all the amendments especially the next two.,191,,
707,0.97,7103.896,7122.615,"So just to provide some contexts to AMENDS two and three, you know, it's my understanding that attempting to regulate so many technology applications at one time has never been implemented in the nation.",191,,
708,0.97,7122.682,7153.312,"I want to make sure we are careful with the flexibility and benefits to consumers, workers and small business business and I support minimum wage for gig workers who have no way in their wages, but marketplace companies provide a brand and computer application technology to workers who set their own rate and should be exempt from the law.",191,,
709,0.97,7153.379,7164.056,And these two amendments will help to accomplish this goal regarding the far-reaching legislation.,191,,
710,0.97,7164.123,7176.002,So this I think Amy Gore described it well but I will be happy to answer Questios as well.,191,,
711,0.97,7176.068,7179.572,"Thank you, Pedersen.",192,,
712,0.97,7179.639,7180.172,Councilmember Lewis?,192,,
713,0.97,7180.239,7187.713,"Thank you, Madam I have some questions for Amy Gore.",193,,
714,0.97,7187.78,7193.152,This is a topic I have been undecided about in the process of doing this work.,193,,
715,0.97,7193.219,7219.278,I got into this work with you on this area mostly because of the matches and the inequities I am familiar with in how the delivery Apps operate and how they have passed on a lot of expenses and the marketplace was not aware of and come to learn about them.,193,,
716,0.97,7219.345,7246.439,And I have questions for Amy because my primary area of interest is the extent to which the amendments from which Councilmember Pedersen would undermine the work on a delivery App and create potential loopholes for the delivery Apps to Reconstitute themselves to be a marketplace App and exempt themselves from the protections that we are passing.,193,,
717,0.97,7246.505,7267.193,"And I would just ask Amy on this, what would be the impact of the primary engaged versus exclusively engaged in terms of potentially opening the loophole as far as that criteria interacts with Prongs two and three?",193,,
718,0.97,7267.259,7269.228,Those would have to be read together.,193,,
719,0.97,7269.295,7269.895,Correct?,193,,
720,0.97,7269.962,7280.239,"Can you talk about like if you were Doordash, for example, what would you have to do to become a marketplace App under this change definition?",193,,
721,0.97,7280.306,7283.643,Are we opening a risk for that?,193,,
722,0.97,7283.709,7317.41,"To answer that the caveat that it was difficult to plan out all the scenarios with the new legislation but for a specific example with a company like Doordash that does an On-Demand delivery, there is one of the sentences that I did not read of the definition, that it specifies that On-Demand network companies and companies that provide delivery services are not marketplace network companies.",194,,
723,0.97,7317.476,7340.199,"So I think no matter what the criteria are, it would be difficult for a company like Doordash that does that type of delivery work on demand to change their business model to be a marketplace network company.",194,,
724,0.97,7340.266,7379.705,"They would have to be offering Pre-Scheduled offer, and outside of the On-Demand window that is not compatible with the business model and allow the workers to set their own price and the offer of a payment of a job and they would have to stop monitoring workers by mileage or time.",194,,
725,0.97,7379.772,7393.919,I think that criteria would make it more difficult for a company that does not change their business operation.,194,,
726,0.97,7393.986,7398.591,Thank you.,195,,
727,0.97,7398.657,7400.392,Councilmember,196,,
728,0.97,7400.459,7403.729,Thank you very much.,197,,
729,0.97,7403.796,7415.307,"You know, I want to follow up Councilmember Lewis's comment, the word enforcement.",197,,
730,0.97,7415.374,7418.244,Exclusive seems to create a broader line.,197,,
731,0.97,7418.31,7457.116,"The Office of labor standards have weighed in on how this would impact enforcement, and Madam chair, while I have the Mic, another question for central staff whether or not we know if workers get guidance from these companies on rates or pressure to lower rates? one of the things I heard about is there might not be direct engagement or dictating of rates, placement of workers on an App and Prioritizing workers over others, depending on which Gigs they accept or don't is still prevalent along various platforms.",197,,
732,0.97,7457.183,7459.919,I am wondering if you can answer those questions.,197,,
733,0.97,7459.985,7460.486,Yes.,198,,
734,0.97,7460.553,7480.973,We did receive feedback from Orf that they exclusive the exclusively language or in terms of kind of a Brightline of yes or no to define the marketplace companies.,198,,
735,0.97,7481.04,7483.943,And the second question--I'm sorry.,198,,
736,0.97,7484.009,7487.379,"At this point, I forgot your second question.",198,,
737,0.97,7487.446,7502.094,"If I may, Madam whether or not they have strategy where is they are affecting a worker gets a gig or not based on a placement of the worker on an App or platform.",199,,
738,0.97,7502.161,7502.728,Thank you.,200,,
739,0.97,7502.795,7503.596,I apologize about that.,200,,
740,0.97,7503.662,7531.757,We have heard from workers that they do--that the company does encourage them to set their rates at a certain level . I am not aware of and companies that currently use their Algorithms to promote particular workers based on their--based on their cost . It seems to be more about ratings or jobs that they have completed.,200,,
741,0.97,7531.824,7543.702,"Again, these are Algorithms or other Technologies that could be changed to promote workers based on their rates easily, I presume.",200,,
742,0.97,7543.769,7547.873,So that is an option for the company.,200,,
743,0.97,7547.94,7548.641,Thank you.,201,,
744,0.97,7548.707,7555.581,A quick question I have before we move back over to Councilmember Lewis.,201,,
745,0.97,7555.648,7567.726,"This amendment and the changing of the definition of network companies, it doesn't only affect minimum requirements . correct?",201,,
746,0.97,7567.793,7595.921,"It--it potentially if you fall out of the marketplace or company, there is other control that would not be of a regulation that a company has to adhere to.",201,,
747,0.97,7595.988,7597.923,Is that correct?,201,,
748,0.97,7597.99,7605.464,You can briefly touch on that impact?,201,,
749,0.97,7605.531,7605.898,Sure.,202,,
750,0.97,7605.965,7616.542,The bill as introduced has a definition for marketplace company and some regulation which is are specialized related to marketplace network companies.,202,,
751,0.97,7616.608,7648.007,"For example, marketplace network companies do not track by geography and would not have to pay for engaged miles . so as for legislation right now, changing this definition might put certain companies into or out of the marketplace definition and then the specific marketplace network company regulations might apply to them.",202,,
752,0.97,7648.073,7672.965,"However, what I think you are referring to is if amendment three passes where they are excluded from both the minimum payment Standard and the flexibility requirement and transparency requirement that are also included in the bill . We can talk more about that under amendment three as well.",202,,
753,0.97,7673.032,7673.565,Thank you.,203,,
754,0.97,7673.632,7691.25,A quick follow up on that . But if you--if you are--if neither meets the definition of a marketplace network company nor a On-Demand network company what would --,203,,
755,0.97,7691.316,7691.717,Yes.,204,,
756,0.97,7691.784,7716.809,"The network company is an umbrella term and there are two sun sets, two Subsets temperature you do not meet the marketplace or On-Demand company you are still considered a network company if you meet the definition and are covered by the bill.",204,,
757,0.97,7716.875,7727.786,"Amy, you bill, the base proposal that the marketplace companies are not tracking their workers geographically speaking.",205,,
758,0.97,7727.853,7731.323,I believe this amendment ALTERS that?,205,,
759,0.97,7731.39,7759.485,"So in general, heard is the most marketplace network companies do not track their workers by geography . so for example, Doordash or Instacart, they are tracking workers as they do the offer . However, this is not necessarily the case for all the marketplace network companies.",206,,
760,0.97,7759.551,7771.763,"There is one particular geographic Functionality in the Rover App that allows the pet Walker to share the route on, for example, a dog walk with the customer after the walk is done.",206,,
761,0.97,7771.83,7777.903,"And so, that is placed on the--that is share through the App.",206,,
762,0.97,7777.97,7786.411,So it's kind of a question of like how do you define geographic monitoring?,206,,
763,0.97,7786.478,7803.729,They requested that the geographic monitoring be removed from the definition in order to allow that Functionality and not create a gray area as it relates to that Functionality on the Rover App.,206,,
764,0.97,7803.795,7806.632,Thank you.,207,,
765,0.97,7806.698,7807.833,Councilmember Lewis?,207,,
766,0.97,7807.9,7811.637,My questions are answered by just that last response.,208,,
767,0.97,7811.703,7811.937,Thank you.,208,,
768,0.97,7812.004,7813.839,Very good.,209,,
769,0.97,7813.906,7814.606,Councilmember Mosqueda?,209,,
770,0.97,7814.673,7815.474,Thank you.,210,,
771,0.97,7815.541,7826.385,I would like to understand a little bit more about the geographic monitoring by a marketplace company.,210,,
772,0.97,7826.451,7839.731,"Is there a way to tailor that? a consumer would be excited to know where their dog was walked, bargain if you not a pertinent information for a company.",210,,
773,0.97,7839.798,7847.839,You think that would be information shared between the client and worker or the provider of the labor.,210,,
774,0.97,7847.906,7861.253,So is there some nuance through information could be provided through a purchaser of the labor versus having the information shared with the company?,210,,
775,0.97,7861.32,7870.729,Or is this amendment that the information is also shared with the company?,210,,
776,0.97,7870.796,7891.75,"My understanding is maps, for example, shared through the platform but not monitored by the company . they don't look at it--I think they would have the ability to look at it but the current practice is not look at that to see where the Walker went or see the routes that they have taken anyway.",211,,
777,0.97,7891.817,7897.322,I hear your concern about the companies monitoring in that way.,211,,
778,0.97,7897.389,7919.611,I don't believe that is current practice but certainly if that was something that you were concerned about that is maybe something that we could continue to work on as the--as the legislation is considered.,211,,
779,0.97,7919.678,7922.681,Thank you.,212,,
780,0.97,7922.748,7923.548,Councilmember,213,,
781,0.97,7923.615,7939.965,"Thank you so much amendment and I look forward to chatting more about that . Madam chair, I will be voting no due to the enforcement concerns especially with Ols has signed on it.",214,,
782,0.97,7940.032,7943.869,I think all the work on this.,214,,
783,0.97,7943.935,7952.177,"Thank you so much, Councilmember Mosqueda.",215,,
784,0.97,7952.244,7963.255,And wanting to focus my comments on what we heard from the International employment law project in the May tenth letter to Council.,215,,
785,0.97,7963.322,7982.04,"They are also advocating not having the piecemeal approach but really focusing on regulating workers who share the over arching comments, characteristics of receiving their task through a Digital application.",215,,
786,0.97,7982.107,8035.727,"This makes good sense, and both the marketplace platforms and network companies defined in the bill manage their business based on the technology to comply with the bill and goes on to say historically exclusion from and limitations on bedrock protections have excluded too many workers, particularly too many black and immigrant workers that is consist tonight raise Seattle'S equity and with the Council's role on wage and labor and improve workers' lives and promote a healthy and vibrant economy.",215,,
787,0.97,8035.794,8043.869,"And again, I--I recognize the--that there--we don't know what we don't know.",215,,
788,0.97,8043.935,8070.762,But we have a hard time imagining how existing On- demand network companies could Refigure their Algorithms in a way to or their models in a way to be defined as a marketplace network but I have concerns even without imagining a new business model.,215,,
789,0.97,8070.829,8095.954,I do have concerns as expressed by Councilmember Mosqueda and both our labor standards advisory committee and the office of labor standards about the ability to enforce the concept of primarily versus exclusively.,215,,
790,0.97,8096.021,8107.332,"So one of the flags, I too, am leaning to vote against amendment two.",215,,
791,0.97,8107.399,8107.933,Councilmember Lewis?,215,,
792,0.97,8107.999,8111.002,"Thank you, Herbold.",216,,
793,0.97,8111.069,8116.074,I have spent time Obsessing this.,216,,
794,0.97,8116.141,8125.383,I do ultimately disagree that this particular category of App is so more by virtue of being an App.,216,,
795,0.97,8125.45,8144.102,I do think the business model similarly gives me this abiding concern there could be unintended consequences in the other direction and it could be every inclusive and have strange results.,216,,
796,0.97,8144.169,8179.871,I think the conversation about the geographic location interfaces with Rover walking the dogs is an illustration of the fact that I--I just keep having the abiding sense that we are inserting the regulation of the marketplace App into primarily which is an On-Demand regulatory delivery bill . But that doesn't mean I'm opposed to doing something to regulate the App.,216,,
797,0.97,8179.938,8207.198,I think there are Stakeholders that would warrant attention from the city with the tailored marketplace App but I think there are places throughout the bill not just with the pay standard but with some of the flexibility and transparency requirements that don't deeply apply to this category of business model.,216,,
798,0.97,8207.265,8283.842,"So I'm satisfied from the responses from central staff that the tightness of the definition of such that it would be difficult for the delivery App to change their business model in order to undermine the application of this legislation to Instacart and Doordash and Uber eats . because I was struggling with this, I drafted an amendment with the anticipation of supporting this route and have throughout the next several months that they do severely think it would be impossible to do this without having loopholes that under mine this App--this application and the delivery Apps to change this if something like that materializes but I just--every time I look into this with more detail, I look for a way to take an elephant and refine it into a Whale.",216,,
799,0.97,8283.908,8287.245,So I'm inclined to vote for this today.,216,,
800,0.97,8287.312,8288.58,And thank LWIS.,217,,
801,0.97,8288.647,8299.724,"And once again, I have gotten a bit out of order.",217,,
802,0.97,8299.791,8307.799,"Councilmember Pedersen, we will have you move your amendment before we vote.",217,,
803,0.97,8307.866,8317.709,"Chair Herbold, I underlying bill with the amendment.",218,,
804,0.97,8317.776,8319.244,Thank you.,219,,
805,0.97,8319.31,8319.844,The second?,219,,
806,0.97,8319.911,8324.949,Councilmember you for the second.,220,,

809,0.97,8334.325,8335.46,Thank you very chair.,222,,
810,0.97,8335.527,8377.936,"I want to make sure I understand if this amendment passes what is at stake or on the to-do list and this is a question for central staff that's great or labor standards f they are watching they can get back to us and let us know . But my understanding from hearing the analysis from central staff and looking at the amendment is it could vastly span the marketplace company creating such a loophole that the ability to track On-Demand jobs, the ability for office of labor standards to understand whether and which type of jobs they are supposed to be tracking could be nearly impossible.",222,,
811,0.97,8378.002,8416.641,"It could be a barrier of enforcement, the entirety of a company before determining whether the workers are being paid what they need, so is there any written analysis that office of labor standards currently has in front of us that we could take a look to see if that assumption about whether or not this is creating a loophole or meaning that they could offer On-Demand work while performing the work and stop and start work but not have to pay that, will that be a problem?",222,,
812,0.97,8416.708,8433.892,"These are the questions I think will undermine the heart of the bill, and I am not seeing things to counter that from the cosponsor, and I am asking about a full list before the final passage of the bill.",222,,
813,0.97,8433.958,8435.827,Sure.,223,,
814,0.97,8435.894,8439.33,"Thank you, Mosqueda.",224,,
815,0.97,8439.397,8470.795,"I will work a more written response to you and they expressed that they prefer the exclusively rather than primarily, and the primarily language requires them to keep them looking at the company, for example, how many of your offers are Pre- scheduled of versus on demand in determining if it's a marketplace company.",225,,
816,0.97,8470.862,8516.007,"And a similar way using the primarily engaged language with the on demand companies, and we'll be having to look at companies that are on demand to ensure--like they will have to determine how much work they need before they are an on demand or marketplace company . I will work with Ols to get a written response to your question about, special, you know, how much workplace this would be in addition to the workplace definition.",225,,
817,0.97,8516.074,8518.243,"Thank you, Amy.",226,,

We heard from Jerry Tyson earlier in comments and they wrote a letter representing how his community is seeing unintended consequences and calling for a study.",256,,

872,0.97,8943.334,8951.709,We are not regulating business models because they are constantly changing and evolving.,257,,

896,0.97,9147.938,9183.507,This is to give Ols the opportunity to interface with the committee in light of the amendments that we just passed to Promulgate additional staff if the market is adapting or evolving or changing to exclude work that is envisioned by the ordinance and companies exploiting the definitions in amendment two and amendment three.,272,,
897,0.97,9183.574,9200.357,And by formally putting in a report back as Ols will grapple with this it gives us an tuned Revisit this if it undermines the scope and scale and gives us an opportunity to be involved in the process.,272,,
898,0.97,9200.424,9202.993,So that is essentially the amendment.,272,,

917,0.97,9317.041,9346.07,"So let me just see if we can do a quick on the spot analysis . We are working on actively updating our fiscal notes to make them reflective of the ongoing cost and I assume that an amendment like this would add to the cost and if I understand Councilmember Pedersen, if I understand your analysis, it would add to the cost do.",282,,
918,0.97,9346.136,9350.207,Do we have any estimate how this would affect the cost?,282,,
919,0.97,9350.274,9351.875,I can answer that.,283,,
920,0.97,9351.942,9359.717,So the actual amendment does not require any particular additional work on behalf of Ols.,283,,
921,0.97,9359.783,9410.033,"It asks that if they are seeing companies change their business model that they report that back to the city Council and really, the expectation is that would not be a new body of work but, instead, that would be something that they might observe through their year-long or more Rule-Making process . It does request that if they are seeing that kind of change that they week a new definition of marketplace company and it's anticipated that that work might entail additional resources for Ols and they would come to Council to request those resources for some sort of study or additional work.",283,,
922,0.97,9410.1,9424.782,That is my understanding of the sponsor's intent but I will pass that back to Councilmember Lewis to confirm that.,283,,
923,0.97,9424.848,9425.015,Yeah.,284,,
924,0.97,9425.082,9426.316,That was my intent.,284,,
925,0.97,9426.383,9461.819,"I mean some of the this work Ols will sort of be doing in the general implementation of the legislation anyway, and this is designing an entirely new set of labor regulations and the report back to Vunerabilities, I imagine, will be a component of that work.",284,,
926,0.97,9461.885,9475.732,You appreciate that were and number of moments of and how they were intertwined but this is not what the office of labor and standards intended to authorize.,285,,
927,0.97,9475.799,9498.789,"I think there is unauthorized standards on the company be hive year in the industry and finish office of labor standards is now in the process of having to look to see if the company is shifting behavior for the type of workers that they have, I think it's a whole other set of policies that we might have to consider or let me Rephrase that.",285,,
928,0.97,9498.856,9510.601,A set of resources that we might want to consider so Ols has the and--capacity to do the analysis.,285,,
929,0.97,9510.667,9551.241,"I will be voting yes because I think it's important to get the data but the notes are that we need to point back here every year, and especially years like now, and we need a better understanding of what the standards would be from the office of labor standards and ski that they add this to their list and I am not sure that we have the underlying bill in the full intent in front of us to make sure that we are accomplishing those protections especially for the most gig workers if we have a worry that they will be shifting behavior within this industry.",285,,
930,0.97,9551.308,9567.958,"So, yes, I would like to know more about what they see and I want to be really clear with the office of labor standards and Committee but this is not what the office of labor standards was going to do anyway.",285,,
931,0.97,9568.025,9585.709,I will be voting yes but I think we need a clearer understanding of the capacity and with the scope of the need for the Department as well.,285,,

The amount of the the reductions are in the middle of the memo in the list of amendments, and specifically, the associated cost fact sore reduced in 1.13 to 1.12.",299,,
950,0.97,9690.514,9700.624,The associated time factor reduced in 1.21 to 1.17 and the associated mileage factor reduced in 1.25 to 1.10.,299,,
951,0.97,9700.69,9722.045,"And the ultimate result is the Perfect-Offer minimum amount for average workers would be less and in 2022, the Per- minute payment would be from 39 cents per minute to 32 cents per Milt and the Per- mile amount would be 73 cents per mile to 64 cents per mile.",299,,

979,0.97,9904.094,9935.392,"Just one year to consider changing, and also it helps the network companies because as the Ols director proposes or implements changes to the underlying calculations, they have to change their Algorithms, et cetera because the minimum pay standards will change.",318,,
980,0.97,9935.458,9943.8,So it helps those companies as well.,318,,
981,0.97,9943.867,9968.024,And it provides for more predictability in the marketplace and it helps the small businesses that rely on the App-Based services and the networks themselves and the users and drivers.,318,,

1001,0.97,10069.125,10085.909,This is sponsored Herbold and give the director of the office of labor standards the majority to adjustment the associated cost factor and time factor.,334,,
1002,0.97,10085.975,10114.838,"This amendment would grant authority to Ols directors to adjustment the associated mileage factor continually and provide Signage on these factor which is making adjustment .

1004,0.97,10115.605,10127.717,"This is proposed by Councilmember Lewis and I, and I don't have too much to have add.",335,,
1005,0.97,10127.784,10166.155,"It was as stated, correcting a drafting error and taking the amendment that LOWERS the associated mileage factor from 1.25 to 1.1 and the next amendment from Councilmember Nelson will make changes that were made in the previous amendment to this amendment .

1008,0.97,10172.328,10175.932,"Amy, do you want to that?",337,,
1009,0.97,10175.999,10189.946,The associated factor accounts for mileage that--the mileage that a worker drives while they are working on an offer is covered under the guaranteed minimum payment.,338,,
1010,0.97,10190.013,10202.158,The mileage factor is a Multiplier to account for mileage that is driven before or after they begin their offer.,338,,
1011,0.97,10202.225,10217.84,"For example, maybe a Doordash driver, after they delivered the order, they are no longer paid, so they need to return back to an area where they are probably doing a pickup.",338,,
1012,0.97,10217.907,10232.255,So it's that kind of extra mileage that considers before or after an offer is to cover that type of mileage.,338,,
1013,0.97,10232.322,10232.689,Thank you.,339,,
1014,0.97,10232.755,10234.524,All right.,340,,

1021,0.97,10265.121,10283.039,"I know that the making, the devil's often in the details, and in my opinion a lot of the details are left to Ols' Directors' direction outside of the scope of Council approval.",343,,
1022,0.97,10283.106,10286.109,So that's always been a Gripe of mine.,343,,
1023,0.97,10286.175,10312.735,But the thing about the--I guess I always assumed that the associated costs factors would not change,343,,
1024,0.97,10323.646,10362.418,"It's not cars driven in this area and for the driving and the beacon study looked at insurance rates and gas prices and depreciation rates and they said .30 or now .36 would be better because of rising gas prices but regardless, again, I will vote no because I'm trying to create predictability.",344,,
1025,0.97,10362.485,10373.429,To Weigh-In on the underlying input and the things that drive the minimum pay standard.,344,,
1026,0.97,10373.496,10382.839,"Thank you, any initial comments or discussion about this amendment?",345,,
1027,0.97,10382.905,10388.711,"Again, it does not require an adjustment and it gives the authority to do so.",345,,

1083,0.97,10669.492,10675.564,Amendment 8 would change the notice of rights section and it would be three ways.,381,,
1084,0.97,10675.631,10700.523,"One would require Ols to produce a model notice of rights and translations where the current draft has it as permissive and it would also require that the notice of rights has a description of whether the network company identifies as On-Demand, marketplace or neither and what the implications are for engaged time and miles and would also require the network company to file their notice of rights with Ols.",381,,
1085,0.97,10700.589,10743.966,"This amendment would ensure that the accurate translations are available to network companies and assist Ols with outreach and implementation by clarifying for the workers what type of network company they likely work for and when to expect time and miles to apply . I recognize with the passage of amendment 2 and three, excluding marketplace networks from coverage, we made to adjust the language of the amendment, which we can do now at the virtual table or we can figure it out for the full council .

1089,0.97,10752.575,10775.097,"My may leave it in for now because I don't think it hurts since they are excluded from coverage and we can adjust for the full Council, but we could, technically, amend it now and we would send a new version by Email to everyone but it might be a bit of a delay.",383,,
1090,0.97,10775.164,10775.364,Yes.,384,,

1116,0.97,10889.211,10906.262,Amendment number nine AMENDS the subsection on up front disclosures in a number of ways to accommodate those network companies that make offers to workers that involve multiple orders in a single offer and where the company doesn't know in advance the details of each order.,397,,
1117,0.97,10906.328,10924.446,"The first, as you Scroll down if you have the amendment in front of you, it contains a technical correction regarding tip disclosures that was included in case amendment 1 didn't pass for some reason and that is what that is about and it is taken care of because amendment number one past.",397,,
1118,0.97,10924.513,10947.703,"It would require rules to be adopted, clarifying the disclosure of unsealed contents of Online orders, so Ols can work out the details on the manner and method of disclosure . It may involve further deed Tauren wells to state with these companies where the Online order is not known in advance of the offer.",397,,
1119,0.97,10947.77,10957.046,"Finally, this amendment would allow additional information to be disclosed after an offer is accepted, instead of in advance of the offer.",397,,
1120,0.97,10957.112,10972.594,"It would only apply to Prescheduled offers or offers containing multiple Online orders, such as an offer for a Prescheduled block of deliveries and only if the company lacks advance notice of that information.",397,,
1121,0.97,10972.661,10977.199,"That would need to be disclosed before the specific Online order is assigned to a worker, if it is ascertainable.",397,,
1122,0.97,10977.266,10996.518,"The information in question includes a number of engaged miles, any tips and the names of businesses to be visited . The underlying draft also says that it applies to the physical labor required for the order and any unsealed contents.",397,,
1123,0.97,10996.585,11002.691,Thank you so much.,398,,

1127,0.97,11021.009,11035.29,"The amendment reflects that there are certain network companies that we are asking to disclose information and based on how they do the delivery, they wouldn't have, at the time, the legislation, originally.",399,,
1128,0.97,11035.357,11060.149,"People sign up for a shift more in advance and they don't necessarily know what is going to be in the vehicle when they are ultimately delivering it . So, it's not really fair to require that platform to define in advance what will be in those packages or that it is burdensome.",399,,
1129,0.97,11060.215,11080.202,This reflects that in some cases--and I would also add that it's different from food delivery Apps where they could be an analogy situation or something like that in an order that could pose an issue to the driver.,399,,
1130,0.97,11080.269,11091.346,"We are mostly talking about sealed contents like Amazon deliveries here, just to reflect that we are requesting certain information they wouldn't have at any given time based on their model.",399,,

1154,0.97,11162.317,11163.285,Yes.,417,,
1155,0.97,11163.352,11201.523,"Amendment 14 of version one is sponsored by Councilmember Nelson and this amendment would remove the tip amount from up front disclosure requirements for each offer and as a result, network companies would not be required to provide tip amounts when facilitating or presenting an offer and to provide more context for each offer, network companies are required in the introduce legislation to provide a range of information to include the best estimate of reasonable engaged time, reasonable engaged mind and guaranteed network company payments, tip amounts and other information.",417,,
1156,0.97,11201.59,11225.914,"This amendment would remove the amount of tips a customer may have indicated, although customers are not required to indicate tips from the guaranteed minimum payment . due to the definition of how tips intersect with guaranteed minimum payment, companies would not be allowed with this amendment passing, to fold tips into the minimum payment that is part of the offer.",417,,
1157,0.97,11225.981,11234.99,"So, workers would not be surprised to find that they don't get a tip because it's already been included in the offer.",417,,
1158,0.97,11235.057,11237.392,I feel like that is important to distinguish.,417,,
1159,0.97,11237.459,11237.826,That is a summary.,417,,
1160,0.97,11237.893,11239.695,Thank you so much.,418,,
1161,0.97,11239.761,11252.274,"Councilmember Nelson, would you like to speak to the amendment before we move the amendment?",418,,
1162,0.97,11252.341,11253.775,Thank you.,419,,
1163,0.97,11253.842,11265.02,The policy rationale of this regulatory framework is to establish the predictable minimum wage that is a living wage for the drivers.,419,,
1164,0.97,11265.087,11270.225,"If this passes, that is what we are, in fact, doing.",419,,
1165,0.97,11270.292,11287.476,"With the associated cost factors that we just approved by amendment, basically, we are talking about if there are three trips that are 20 minutes long and five miles each in one hour, that equals about $32.50 for 20 minute tips.",419,,
1166,0.97,11287.542,11355.277,"The reason for doing this is so that workers don't have to rely on tips for the lions share of their payment from working for these App-Based companies . So, that's what we are trying to do here and requiring that the tip amount be shown up front does create the possibility--and what we've heard from some Stakeholders--the likelihood that there will be Cherry picking among drivers that will only be picking the trips that are highly tipped . This then does create a customer and consumer protection issue because that means it will be disproportionately Impactful on low income people who can't afford high tips or often the same folks who order low priced things for delivery, like the fast food, for example or whatever.",419,,
1167,0.97,11355.343,11362.117,"I do think we have to take seriously the fact that this could negatively impact the consumers, the customers using these applications.",419,,
1168,0.97,11362.184,11371.626,"At any rate, aside from that, the way that tips are solicited and collected varies widely across the platforms and by different models.",419,,
1169,0.97,11371.693,11405.293,"For example, many of these applications do not ask--people may be assigned a tip after the delivery shipped . Many companies, that is the case and with this variation and the difficulty, perhaps, of enforcing that kind of variation, I just believe that, you know, the requirement for tip disclosure prior to accepting an offer is redundant.",419,,
1170,0.97,11405.36,11416.505,"For example, Dasher'S will always do the full customer tip as a separate line item after every delivery in accordance Wih the transparency in the proposal.",419,,
1171,0.97,11416.571,11440.262,This amendment is offered for the benefit of the customers who could be left waiting a long time for people to accept their delivery because there is no tip or the item is so low price at the tip ends up being very small.,419,,
1172,0.97,11440.328,11446.868,"Thank you, Nelson.",420,,
1173,0.97,11446.935,11448.703,"Looking for clarifying questions, first.",420,,

1180,0.97,11473.295,11484.739,A question for central staff . I'm confused by the Lane we are trying to occupy here.,423,,
1181,0.97,11484.806,11492.013,This is really a piece of legislation broadly intended to provide additional clarification regulation for workers that are independent contractors.,423,,
1182,0.97,11492.08,11506.728,"Should the independent contractor not be able to choose the work they are doing? isn't that the goal for them to set their own rates, especially as amendment number three says, we don't guarantee access for minimum wage for the Subset of workers.",423,,
1183,0.97,11506.795,11527.382,"If the goal is for workers to make an informed choice about whichever job they choose as an independent contractor, does this get into a murky area of defining wages and tips for the workers?",423,,
1184,0.97,11527.749,11545.033,"It's a policy rather than a determination on whether it would make a worker--providing tip information, whether it would make a comment on worker status.",424,,
1185,0.97,11545.1,11554.876,"Inherently, tips are discretionary by the customer and even if indicated in the beginning of an offer, it doesn't necessarily mean the customer would end up paying that and that is one way to look at it.",424,,
1186,0.97,11554.943,11571.359,"So, I think that there is an argument that if a customer has indicated a tip, that the worker should know that information.",424,,
1187,0.97,11571.426,11580.101,"As an independent contractor, they can choose or not choose the work they would like to accept and that right is memorialized in the flexibility section.",424,,
1188,0.97,11580.168,11594.382,"On the other hand, if this amendment were to pass, it would be discretionary and wouldn't prevent the companies from providing that information and would not require them to do so.",424,,
1189,0.97,11594.449,11618.44,"One could say that tips aren't certain and companies shouldn't be required to provide that information, if there is uncertainty about it and companies might decide not to provide that information in order to promote more equal access among customers.",424,,
1190,0.97,11618.506,11630.819,"I think it could go either way but certainly, understanding your concern about workers not having the full amount of information that is available to companies when making that decision.",424,,
1191,0.97,11630.885,11631.319,Thank you for that.,425,,
1192,0.97,11631.386,11644.032,"Any further clarifying questions before we get the amendment before us? Alex, a question?",425,,
1193,0.97,11644.099,11647.068,A clarifying the base legislation and what it allows and requires.,426,,
1194,0.97,11647.135,11658.58,Tip policies need to be disclosed to the workers up front and companies can allow for tips to be removed.,426,,
1195,0.97,11658.646,11659.681,Customers can remove tips and that has been an issue.,426,,
1196,0.97,11659.748,11683.204,"We've seen it flagged and currently the base legislation allows that to occur with tips to be removed after an order is completed, even if they were given up front on the order . It needs to be disclosed within the policy that the company gives its workers.",426,,
1197,0.97,11683.271,11686.608,Very helpful Councilmember Mosqueda?,427,,
1198,0.97,11686.674,11692.18,"As a follow-up, base legislation and thank you for that clarification.",428,,
1199,0.97,11692.247,11697.886,"Central staff, can you remind me what New York did regarding this concept?",428,,
1200,0.97,11697.952,11721.309,"My York's equivalent of the office of labor standards is currently crafting they are minimum payment policy right now . We don't know what it is . correct me if I'm wrong on that . But, I don't believe they've been given the authority to develop the minimum payment policy but they are in the process of developing that policy.",429,,
1201,0.97,11721.376,11728.183,I do believe that I there were some elements of that policy that went into place about a month ago or a few weeks ago.,430,,
1202,0.97,11728.249,11732.72,I'm not sure of the status of the tip disclosure . We can certainly look at that.,430,,
1203,0.97,11732.787,11742.097,I'm not aware of that as one of the pieces that went into effect already.,430,,
1204,0.97,11742.163,11764.786,You are looking and that is my understanding . a rule related to the requirement to disclose equal pay of front--it has recently passed in New York City.,431,,
1205,0.97,11764.853,11767.355,"Councilmember Nelson, do you have a clarifying question?",431,,
1206,0.97,11767.422,11771.726,I don't want to get debating the amendment until we get it in front of us.,432,,
1207,0.97,11771.793,11776.197,I will get it and then make a point.,433,,
1208,0.97,11776.264,11779.467,Would you like to motion?,434,,
1209,0.97,11779.534,11781.536,I move this,435,,
1210,0.97,11781.603,11781.87,Thank you.,436,,
1211,0.97,11781.936,11782.137,A second?,436,,
1212,0.97,11782.203,11782.437,Second.,437,,
1213,0.97,11782.504,11782.804,Thank you.,438,,
1214,0.97,11782.871,11787.642,Councilmember Nelson?,438,,
1215,0.97,11787.709,11819.44,"This is what find when I was talking before . According to one of the presentations that was presented--the first one since I've been in office on February 8th 2022, the central step presentations has, on page four, the policy goal of establishing a minimum payment to provide or ensure payment of minimum wage plus expenses with the permanent and per mile floor for the engaged time to perform each offer.",439,,
1216,0.97,11819.507,11821.743,I will say again that that is what we are doing.,439,,
1217,0.97,11821.809,11832.253,"So, I believe this does not conflict with the overall rationale of this legislation before us.",439,,
1218,0.97,11832.32,11869.757,"This area of the think, fits more into the flexibility objectives of the policy, to make sure that the App-Based worker has the information necessary to choose whether or not to take a gig . They can't do that without having full information about the remuneration for the gig . I want to flagged that.",440,,
1219,0.97,11869.824,11883.471,"Councilmember Lewis and I received in the Email from a Doordash worker before this amendment was developed, and the Doordash worker didn't know a lot.",440,,
1220,0.97,11883.538,11917.071,"It has not evolved with the work in Washington campaign with a Doordash worker organically contacting us . He said the problem as a Doordash worker--and I hope your legislation deals with that--this constituent wrote and was really concerned that Doordash would continue to hide tips, noting that there is an incentive that Doordash receives the same amount regardless of whether or not there is no tip or a very large one.",440,,
1221,0.97,11917.138,11928.583,"There is concern that without the information, workers are forced to accept and gamble whether or not they will pay a fair wage.",440,,
1222,0.97,11928.65,11929.984,"So, more generally speaking, there are independent contractors.",440,,
1223,0.97,11930.051,11939.227,"A part of the work is being able to know up front before accepting a job, what the variables are.",440,,
1224,0.97,11939.294,11946.034,It's that transparency that allows workers to have the flexibility associated with this type of work.,440,,
1225,0.97,11946.1,11958.413,"For that reason, I appreciate it being brought forward but I will not be supporting this amendment.",440,,
1226,0.97,11958.479,11966.454,I totally see the the person who Emailed you in the current situations without knowing what the wage will be . that's what I'm saying.,441,,
1227,0.97,11966.521,11976.664,"This legislation, it does provide certainty that the driver will earn a living wage.",441,,
1228,0.97,11976.731,11979.734,Councilmember Nelson Councilmember Mosqueda?,442,,
1229,0.97,11979.801,11986.574,"First, let me area of common ground.",443,,
1230,0.97,11986.641,11995.283,One is that I think we want to make sure that all wages that are paid actually compensate workers to have a true minimum wage and work toward an actual living wage.,443,,
1231,0.97,11995.35,12022.777,"I really applaud line of our Restaurateurs and local breweries, like Molly moon's ice cream and plump Bistro and optimism Cafc that build in a higher wage so workers are not reliant on tips to know whether they can put food on the table or pay their rent.",443,,
1232,0.97,12022.844,12027.749,Having separate conversations about a true wage is exciting of there is interest among Councilmembers.,443,,
1233,0.97,12027.815,12038.993,"Specific to this legislation in front of us, if there is going to be the ability to add tips, I want workers to know what those tip amounts are.",443,,
1234,0.97,12039.06,12056.11,"The amendment removes the tip amount from the up front disclosure for each offer . doing a quick analysis, I confirmed with Councilmember Herbold and our chair, that New York now requires tips to be disclosed in full to the workers.",443,,
1235,0.97,12056.177,12071.993,"Companies will already be required to do this in other jurisdictions and many of the concerns that we've heard from with these companies, how do we apply the policies across the country, they will be doing it in New York, now.",443,,
1236,0.97,12072.059,12080.334,"Keeping the language as originally envisioned is really important, to make sure that we have full transparency for the workers doing this work.",443,,
1237,0.97,12080.401,12082.804,Tip stealing is still a very common practice.,443,,
1238,0.97,12082.87,12094.916,"Not just in this industry, but across the board and the want to make sure that tips are truly being displayed for the workers so they know what is owed to them.",443,,
1239,0.97,12094.982,12103.157,"There is examples recently, in 2019, of Instacart paying back workers after tips were disclosed.",443,,
1240,0.97,12103.224,12109.063,Doordash settled with the attorney in D.C. and Amazon flex settled with the FTC over a tip stealing practice.,443,,
1241,0.97,12109.13,12137.625,"Given that these practices are prevalent and specific to this industry, through these examples, there is good reason to have healthy skepticism about the handling of tips if they are not truly disclosed in advance, so that workers know exactly what they should be receiving . I believe this is an important component of the flexibility noted by Councilmember Herbold and for the full transparency we are shooting for.",443,,
1242,0.97,12137.692,12146.367,"I will be voting no on this . If there is interest in a one true wage conversation in the future, I will be very excited about that discussion.",443,,
1243,0.97,12146.434,12147.201,"Thank you, Mosqueda.",444,,
1244,0.97,12147.268,12148.135,"Amy, comments on that?",444,,
1245,0.97,12148.202,12190.211,"Councilmember mentioned that in April, in New York City, it did go into effect that if known, the tip needs to be disclosed to the worker and in addition, the requirements are that prior to soliciting a Gratuity come from a consumer, the company has to disclose to the consumer, the proportion or fixed amount of each Gratuity distributed to the delivery worker and it requires that the companies disclosed to delivery workers how much each consumer made, as a Gratuity.",445,,
1246,0.97,12190.278,12192.413,It definitely does address some of the questions that you guys are discussing.,445,,
1247,0.97,12192.48,12199.186,"Thank you, Amy.",446,,
1248,0.97,12199.253,12199.72,Any additional comments?,446,,

1251,0.97,12210.464,12235.856,"They are doing other things we might be interested in or not doing things--it's helpful to have that comparison with New York . just to clarify on this issue of the tips, if the customer tips the worker after the services provided, that has to be disclosed to the worker, right?",447,,
1252,0.97,12235.923,12236.09,Yes.,448,,
1253,0.97,12236.157,12239.06,"Correct, Pedersen.",449,,

1255,0.97,12241.295,12241.495,Okay.,450,,

1259,0.97,12256.877,12270.424,"I went to respond to Councilmember Mosqueda'S point . This does not facilitate, I believe, the tip stealing . They will know what they received by tips, just not provided up front front.",452,,
1260,0.97,12270.491,12278.132,"You know, for the single mom who has a couple kids and needs a box of Wipes right now . that's the essence of what I'm saying.",452,,

1263,0.97,12304.592,12311.399,"I will take you it's nothing to clarify but I was stating facts for the industry, in terms of the experience that workers have had with tip stealing.",454,,
1264,0.97,12311.465,12320.841,I'm not saying that this amendment is in any way trying to promote tip stealing.,454,,
1265,0.97,12320.908,12336.357,I'm saying it's important that we keep the underlying language so that workers know exactly what the tips are and they know how much to receive and they can measure their final paycheck with what they believe their tips should be and what they received.,454,,
1266,0.97,12336.424,12351.238,"That is the fact and this is already occurring in the industry and in other industries and we need to move collectively for greater transparency for workers if tips are part of the known practice, especially in underpaid industries.",454,,
1267,0.97,12351.305,12363.284,"We look forward to the conversation about one true wage and for folks not familiar with that campaign, we look forward to talking about that and this is really about the transparency so that workers get the tips that have been committed.",454,,

1320,0.97,12701.789,12735.689,"I want to flagged the fact that the need for this amendment was raised by an App-Based forum speaking to the issue of fraud and the proposals were broad and would have allowed companies not only to remove a worker for suspected fraud, but prevent them from Accessing the Apps and even from a completed fraud or suspected fraud.",487,,
1321,0.97,12735.756,12763.317,"This is a broader approach . I appreciate the desire to address the issue and I want to note, of course, that fraud is a crime regardless of whether being committed by a worker or somebody who is defined as a W- 2 employee.",487,,

1325,0.97,12796.817,12804.525,A clarifying who determines whether a cancellation is without cause? under this scenario?,488,,
1326,0.97,12804.591,12829.516,I think the companies would develop a fraudulent use policy . It would clarify the definition of engaged time.,489,,
1327,0.97,12829.583,12836.79,"If they are moving with the cancellation without cause by the App-Based worker, they would not incur engaged time and therefore, no pay.",489,,
1328,0.97,12836.857,12842.162,This is intended for workers to complete that.,489,,

1333,0.97,12865.886,12870.39,They have at least 72 hours to do so.,490,,

1338,0.97,12894.715,12898.652,There are those without cause . The cancellation with cause is an exhaustive list.,492,,
1339,0.97,12898.719,12904.691,It's a little bit broad in the wording and as outlined in the legislation.,492,,

I'm a little concerned about the consequence of having a cancellation without cause being determined as fraud because I wonder whether or not businesses could start engaging in more penalizing strategies or Incentivizing or Codifying the whole determination of cancellation without cause . It seems to be exclusively within the hands of the company.",500,,
1354,0.97,13024.144,13046.032,"They already have this policy and I'm worried about whether or not this is facilitating a new base or floor, Madam chair .

1375,0.97,13158.111,13164.851,Another impact of extending the effective date is it would provide the office of labor standards and network companies with more time to prepare for implementation.,514,,

1380,0.97,13185.872,13214.568,We've heard for the summary of the amendment that gives enough time to work with the Depatment to consider the roles and for the legislation to continue to complement this strategy . I know there is a lot of other strategies that need to go into effect to make sure Ols has sufficient Rulemaking and ability to engage with those that will be applying these new rules and we will err on the side of making sure it can be implemented.,516,,

1430,0.97,13484.904,13496.95,You should the reasoning for doing this . I'm trying to create a buffer between when the rules are available for network companies . It will happen when they are filed by the clerk.,542,,
1431,0.97,13497.016,13537.29,"And, when the legislation will go into effect and possible violations could be incurred . It will take some time between when the rules are known and then changing the code and all the other things necessary before, realistically, the rules can be incorporated not into the business model, but the actual software of these companies.",542,,
1432,0.97,13537.357,13539.058,It was hard to decide how to express this.,542,,
1433,0.97,13539.125,13548.134,Can we give them a buffer so they are not immediately liable for violations when the rules are known?,542,,
1434,0.97,13548.201,13565.018,We can't require Ols--there is a difference between the filing of the rules and the spirit of your amendment with the effective date.,542,,
1435,0.97,13565.084,13587.04,"So, if the rules are filed at 18 months, there is no time, necessarily--there is no time for these companies to modify their platform.",542,,
1436,0.97,13587.106,13602.088,"I said 18 months, anticipating that your amendment would pass . But, not knowing when there would be certain t about the rules and I added six months on, thinking it would be reasonable to make the changes to the code.",542,,
1437,0.97,13602.155,13603.022,Thank you.,543,,
1438,0.97,13603.089,13613.766,"Thank you, Councilmember Nelson, for your explanation about the purpose or your intent of the amendment.",543,,
1439,0.97,13613.833,13621.507,We can see if there are other comments or questions or concerns from other Councilmembers.,543,,
1440,0.97,13621.574,13634.854,May I say that I other suggestions for how to get at what I'm trying to do here.,544,,
1441,0.97,13634.921,13635.855,It seems like this was the cleanest way to go.,544,,
1442,0.97,13635.922,13642.562,Thank you.,545,,
1443,0.97,13642.628,13653.673,"We can get central staff to Opine a little bit on this . My understanding is that Ols always begins with a sort of soft touch on enforcement, focusing on education outreach, first.",545,,
1444,0.97,13653.74,13670.523,"You know, we don't have a history when we passed labor standards, including the TNC fair share legislation, of delaying implementation until after the director's will process.",545,,
1445,0.97,13670.59,13681.834,I'm concerned that we are sending a signal about the authority that we delegate to director's rules.,545,,
1446,0.97,13681.901,13688.908,It would be that we don't allow legislation to go into effect until after the Rulemaking is complete.,545,,
1447,0.97,13688.975,13732.718,"Again, I would be concerned that we are, somehow, sending a signal that the legislation going into effect is contingent on a particular outcome around the development of the rules . The rule process is open to the public and includes a lot of Stakeholder engagement and individual Councilmembers or Councilmembers as a group, can provide input to that process . Maybe central staff can speak a little bit to the Ols approach to enforcing new rules after a fresh directors rule process?",545,,
1448,0.97,13732.785,13734.12,Certainly.,546,,
1449,0.97,13734.187,13765.485,"I do think your general description is accurate about the Ols approach to new laws . It is a policy choice for Councilmembers to decide how much they want to trust that to go forward, or to require the Rulemaking to happen in a certain time period or require implementation to be after Rulemaking.",546,,
1450,0.97,13765.551,13772.458,My understanding is that it could be something that Council can require of Ols.,546,,
1451,0.97,13772.525,13779.031,"The contingent effective date is not unprecedented . It certainly is, for labor standards.",546,,

1472,0.97,13829.615,13837.757,Will central staff describe amendment 13?,559,,
1473,0.97,13837.823,13844.096,"Amendment 13, sponsored by Councilmember Mosqueda.",560,,
1474,0.97,13844.163,13845.631,It would not endow the Ols director with new and substantive authority.,560,,
1475,0.97,13845.698,13859.946,"It would clarify the Council's intent based on the introduced legislation, the office of labor standards can assess investigation costs against the network company.",560,,
1476,0.97,13860.012,13878.497,"The amendment would authorize the director to issue rules for assessing reasonable investigation costs and would strongly encourage the director to do so, to support implementation of this chapter 8.37.",560,,
1477,0.97,13878.564,13879.432,My explanation just contradicted my opener.,560,,
1478,0.97,13879.498,13900.72,When I want to say is that the director is already able to assess investigation costs against a network company in the existing language and reduce legislation which says that the director can assess the reasonable cost incurred in enforcing this chapter.,560,,
1479,0.97,13900.786,13908.261,What this amendment would seek to do is to clarify that those reasonable costs include investigation costs.,560,,
1480,0.97,13908.327,13942.528,The amendment would encourage the director to assess all costs to support the Ols funding needs to implement this legislation . There are other examples of other city departments when they assess enforcement costs and the Seattle Department of transportation can assess enforcement costs for the enforcement of the street and sidewalk use code and the Seattle Department of inspections can enforce the inspection fees for the building and construction use code.,560,,
1481,0.97,13942.595,13951.637,"Also, I believe they can enforce these four enforcing business regulatory license fees, as well.",560,,
1482,0.97,13951.704,13958.444,"Thank you, Karina.",561,,
1483,0.97,13958.511,13964.784,"Councilmember Mosqueda, as a sponsor of this amendment, do you have any additional comments?",561,,
1484,0.97,13964.85,13976.128,"Thank you, Madam thanks to Karina for your work with us and to schedule this with our staff and she is our budget lead.",562,,
1485,0.97,13976.195,14015.701,"We appreciate you walking through the amendment today and highlighting the precedent that was said in other departments . all of us sit on the budget committee and the same on the public safety and human services Committee, as on the Finance and housing committee . We've heard many times that the top budget situation we face this year and looking at the six-year outlook presented by central staff, we know there is much work to be done over the course of the next few years . While we consider legislation important that Aligns with policy values, we also need to acknowledge that it is important to make sure that the budgetary impacts are considered.",562,,
1486,0.97,14015.768,14068.854,This strategy helps put together a process toward looking for ways to make sure there is a possibility of identifying funding in the out years that can build on itself to bring in additional revenue . This amendment allows for the director of office of labor standards the discretion--and I think that's the important word in this amendment--the discretion on whether or not assessments on a case-by-case basis will be applied to make sure we settled violations instead of a much longer process that doesn't benefit I think that this is a late touch approach to make sure we are considering this going forward and look forward to continue to work with all of you as we think about our financial needs for the city and the growing population in Seattle.,562,,
1487,0.97,14068.921,14076.662,"I look forward to supporting this and I hope we will gather support because it helps around out not just the policy codes, but how we continue to make sure it is funded.",562,,
1488,0.97,14076.729,14082.535,"Thank you, Mosqueda.",563,,
1489,0.97,14082.601,14083.536,Thank you for your work on this amendment.,563,,
1490,0.97,14083.602,14094.313,"If there are no further clarifying questions about the amendment, Councilmember Mosqueda, would you like to move it?",563,,
1491,0.97,14094.38,14097.049,"Thank you, Madam I move amendment number 13.",564,,
1492,0.97,14097.116,14097.383,Thank you.,565,,
1493,0.97,14097.45,14097.65,Seconded.,565,,
1494,0.97,14097.716,14099.118,Additional comments questions?,566,,
1495,0.97,14099.185,14108.494,Amendment 13?,566,,
1496,0.97,14108.561,14109.795,Not seeing any?,566,,
1497,0.97,14109.862,14112.832,Councilmember Nelson popping up.,567,,
1498,0.97,14112.898,14115.501,Thank you.,568,,
1499,0.97,14115.568,14115.968,Councilmember Nelson?,568,,
1500,0.97,14116.035,14121.74,"Ols does not investigation costs, reinforcing other labor regulations.",569,,
1501,0.97,14121.807,14135.354,"That work is performed by departmental staff with salaries coming out of the general fund . In other words, that is their job and different from investigations in Sdci or Sdot because those are paid for by permit applications.",569,,
1502,0.97,14135.421,14143.395,"Those can be thought of as you Reserve fees, in a way.",569,,
1503,0.97,14143.462,14155.207,I don't think that is an accurate comparison of how we pay for investigations through DCF.,569,,
1504,0.97,14155.274,14198.083,"This would allow Ols to charge companies even if there is no determination of violation . or, if the investigation ends in a settlement and there is no language prohibiting it, if a investigation is dismissed . According to the interactive dashboard, of the 899 investigations launched, 66% ended in settlement and that is partly because the businesses want it to go away so they can go back to doing business . 12% have ended in no determination of violation and only 11% have ended in determination of violation and 11% were dismissed.",569,,
1505,0.97,14198.15,14236.155,"Even if one AGREES or argues it's the right thing to do to make companies who violate pay regulations pay for the cost of enforcement, in addition to attorney fees if Ols uses outside counsel and in addition to the fees for the actual violation, that's only a fraction of the labor expended in investigations four enforcing this whole package . So, allowing Ols to charge for the work to investigate all the other cases, it isn't really fair to the companies that are really in violation.",569,,
1506,0.97,14236.221,14262.982,"You know, some could say this is a conflict of interest because it could create, you know--it could create the willingness to investigate, just for Investigation'S sake . I'm not saying that is happening but the bottom line, although Ols is allowed to do this, it seems to be the first time this happened.",569,,
1507,0.97,14263.048,14266.218,That is why I'm concerned about this amendment.,569,,
1508,0.97,14266.285,14267.753,Thank you Nelson.,570,,
1509,0.97,14267.82,14283.002,"Again, I think a lot of the issues that you are raising as concerns are issues that Ols does consider.",570,,
1510,0.97,14283.068,14292.077,"As it relates specifically to creating a disincentive to settle, both parties are at the table on the decision to settle.",570,,
1511,0.97,14292.144,14306.692,"You know, I think there is a lot of interest on behalf of Ols and the workers they represent, to settle when appropriate.",570,,
1512,0.97,14306.759,14312.031,"Likewise, there is an interest on the part of businesses to settle.",570,,
1513,0.97,14312.097,14336.755,"I don't think granting the Ols director the discretion to consider this, moving forward with the understanding that everyone has a shared interest in resolving these cases--it's in a way that is expedient and that results in justice for workers.",570,,
1514,0.97,14336.822,14362.181,I am confident that the Ols director will keep all of these issues in front of mind when deciding how and if it is the authority in the amendment . Councilmember Mosqueda?,570,,
1515,0.97,14362.247,14363.615,"Thanks, Madam chair.",571,,
1516,0.97,14363.682,14384.937,My staff spent a lot of time with everybody working through the amendments and none of these concerns were raised . We have to be careful to use the words with our workers in any Department . I think this is intended to be complementary and intended to be supplementary and not to supplant existing costs for the Department.,571,,
1517,0.97,14385.003,14397.516,"It is intended to mirror what we see at the state level, allowing for labor and industry to consider additional fees if it is negotiated as part of the settlement to come back to the state.",571,,
1518,0.97,14397.583,14404.356,"That's the way to make sure that the gears turn and there is good precedent for this, as already established.",571,,
1519,0.97,14404.423,14408.994,There is not great precedent on the crisis in terms of our budgets.,571,,
1520,0.97,14409.061,14417.436,We are trying to be creative about supporting policies and I'm sure there will be other policies across the Council folks would like to see going to statute.,571,,
1521,0.97,14417.503,14436.054,We have to be flexible to think about creative ways to bring additional revenue to support these important policies . This is a light touch approach that can be complementary and support the overall effort that is amended with the bill in front of us to require additional work from the office of labor.,571,,
1522,0.97,14436.121,14443.562,This is in no way an effort to fully fund the fiscal notes associated.,571,,
1523,0.97,14443.629,14446.165,It's intended to be supportive of trying to find greater solutions.,571,,
1524,0.97,14446.231,14446.999,Thank you Mosqueda.,572,,
1525,0.97,14447.065,14450.035,"Councilmember Nelson, a response?",572,,
1526,0.97,14450.102,14454.406,Yes.,573,,
1527,0.97,14454.473,14462.481,I will take those comments into consideration when in the budget cycles we determined the Ols's necessary increased resources for this.,573,,
1528,0.97,14462.548,14479.398,"Councilmember Herbold, you said the director discretion--I wanted to--the language of the amendment does more than grant.",573,,
1529,0.97,14479.464,14490.142,It said the director may issue rules on the amounts and contributing factors for reasonable investigation costs and it is strongly encouraged to assess such costs in favor for the implementation.,573,,
1530,0.97,14490.209,14499.918,"So, I'm reading strongly encouraged as--well, as it's written.",573,,
1531,0.97,14499.985,14500.986,Still discretionary.,574,,
1532,0.97,14501.053,14508.126,I appreciate you highlighting the emphasis.,574,,
1533,0.97,14508.193,14519.071,Any other comments before we call the roll on the final amendment?,574,,
1534,0.97,14519.137,14520.038,Seeing none.,574,,

1552,0.97,14572.591,14578.196,And I will understand if you don't want to make final comments.,586,,
1553,0.97,14578.263,14581.733,It's been a very long session . Thank you.,586,,
1554,0.97,14581.8,14583.001,We've been working on this proposal for a year.,586,,
1555,0.97,14583.068,14584.569,I want to thank the Stakeholders for their engagement.,586,,
1556,0.97,14584.636,14600.519,We've been developing the policy . We will be reviewing our work and legislation covering issues that were not covered in this bill.,586,,
1557,0.97,14600.585,14609.895,I will work with the Stakeholders and the group that we have been working with and any others that would like to join the effort.,586,,

1572,0.97,14758.844,14770.755,"You know, again, if it's a unanimous vote, it would move to the full Council and if is a split vote, it would skip a week.",590,,
1573,0.97,14770.822,14795.347,"I'm happy to consider an amendment that considers the later of the two for options regardless of what happens . for instance, if there is a unanimous vote on this Virgin moving out of committee and we think it would benefit from another week, I'm happy to consider that.",590,,

1577,0.97,14811.496,14833.285,I have already had an excuse for that first Tuesday in June and I'm hoping to keep those plans . I very much agree that we still have a lot of work to do to make sure that we have changes from amendments two and three as requested.,591,,
1578,0.97,14833.351,14850.835,"Many of us have been engaged in conversations with this Committee and I know that, especially when our office is considering amendments, we tried to call every office and spent time talking to staff and/or directly to the Councilmembers.",591,,
