204,0.97,1219.184,1251.683,"I have been, I guess, informally on the board since, I think spring, and I became interested in this because my--I work in transportation, but at the more regional level for King County, and noticed that as a Seattle resident I don't get to do a lot of--I don't get to touch a lot of programs that are actually happening in my own community where I live and in the city and so that's what got me interested in learning more.",72,,
205,0.97,1251.683,1289.454,"I started attending a couple of the board meetings and as someone who has had--has lost family due to a pedestrian crash, hit-and-run and also as someone who, before last--before this year didn't have a car and did rely on my own two feet to get everywhere, I was excited and interested in joining the pedestrian board to make Seattle a safer place to walk and to be able to be involved in something in my own community.",72,,

211,0.97,1296.695,1302.134,I work for King County roads as an environmental scientist.,74,,
212,0.97,1302.134,1308.84,"So I am hearty in the transit world like I think so many people are these boards, it's your job and your passion.",74,,
213,0.97,1308.84,1327.025,"So walking is probably my main form of transportation and my main form of exercise as well and I feel so lucky to live in a place where that's a possibility and having moved from Southern California, it was such a relief to be in a city like that.",74,,
214,0.97,1327.025,1336.768,"Seattle is a wonderful place to walk and be able to use that as your main form of transportation, but it could be better and it could be more accessible.",74,,
215,0.97,1336.768,1354.653,So I am happy to be involved in a board that is working towards those goals and also towards carbon neutral goals because what better way to get to carbon neutral than to make a better Biking and transit area.,74,,

223,0.97,1374.606,1376.441,A question for each of the applicants.,76,,
224,0.97,1376.441,1384.916,"Akshali Gandhi, I see that you worked on Pittsburgh's first complete streets planning policy for the city of Pittsburgh.",76,,
225,0.97,1384.916,1394.693,"Do you have any lessons learned from there, anything that we should be thinking about as we look to create complete streets here in the city of Seattle?",76,,
226,0.97,1394.693,1395.56,Yeah.,77,,
227,0.97,1395.56,1411.51,"I mean, I moved here from Pittsburgh last year and I think one big lesson was we tried to pack everything and the kitchen sink into that policy and tried to appease everyone.",77,,
228,0.97,1411.51,1412.077,Everyone who was involved.,77,,
229,0.97,1412.077,1430.061,"And while it was great to have so many Stakeholders, I think perhaps wanted to try packing the policy with everything that you could possibly imagine, sometimes it Wittels down to nothing and not as enforceable.",77,,
230,0.97,1430.061,1438.57,One lesson learned was to pack the punch with a few key elements rather than try to do everything.,77,,
231,0.97,1438.57,1438.937,Thank you.,78,,
232,0.97,1438.937,1439.404,That's very helpful.,78,,
233,0.97,1439.404,1446.444,"And Emily, I see that you are a volunteer trail builder in your volunteering time.",78,,
234,0.97,1446.444,1466.731,"When we hike and walk, it's also another form of walking around, and how do you take any of your experience trail building and apply that to how we build our streets and make them a more pedestrian friendly environment?",78,,
235,0.97,1466.731,1467.098,"Sure, Yeah.",79,,
236,0.97,1467.098,1467.532,That's a fun one.,79,,
237,0.97,1467.532,1480.912,I guess it's like how do you make a place enjoyable if you're trail building and looking at a forest and thinking how do we trail in here that is the least Impactful but also the most enjoyable so that's something to think about.,79,,
238,0.97,1480.912,1495.427,So we want to make pedestrian infrastructure that flows nicely with the other elements in a trail that's like nature in a city that's loaded with cars and bikes and how do all of those things flow together.,79,,
239,0.97,1495.427,1497.729,The best I got.,79,,
240,0.97,1497.729,1498.63,Fair enough.,80,,

458,0.97,2623.454,2626.623,So I am comfortable moving ahead with this.,174,,
459,0.97,2626.623,2634.531,"Again, colleagues, if any final questions before I make a motion?",174,,

505,0.97,2910.641,2920.717,This is presentation one.,194,,
506,0.97,2920.717,2926.623,Thank you.,195,,
507,0.97,2926.623,2932.863,Please proceed.,196,,
508,0.97,2932.863,2933.163,Conor.,197,,
509,0.97,2933.163,2938.635,My name is Connor Hanson with the mt . Baker housing Association.,198,,
510,0.97,2938.635,2945.676,It is a nonprofit that operates Afordable housing in the Ranier Valley and we have been doing so for about 30 years.,198,,
511,0.97,2945.676,2948.779,I am excited to talk to you about this Commons project today.,198,,
512,0.97,2948.779,2954.584,I have spoken with some of you in the past about it previously.,198,,
513,0.97,2954.584,2962.659,The council passed the Redevelopment opportunity zone to help deal with the funding of the contamination with the Department of Ecology.,198,,
514,0.97,2962.659,2965.662,So that remediation is underway and happening.,198,,
515,0.97,2965.662,2968.165,But today we are talking about the project itself.,198,,
516,0.97,2968.165,2982.245,"This is--this will be an office of housing, affordable housing project so all the units will be reserved for families, individuals earning 60% of the area median income.",198,,
517,0.97,2982.245,2990.02,What the alley vacation does is allow mountain Baker construction to construct a one building project instead of a two building project.,198,,
518,0.97,2990.02,3002.532,So it increased the efficiency in terms of the leverage of the debt proceeds to allow the city ask--or the amount of money that we need from the city to come down by around 4 1/2 million dollars.,198,,
519,0.97,3002.532,3009.206,And this project is--and it also gives us another 45 affordable housing units by vacating the alley.,198,,
520,0.97,3009.206,3014.711,"But this project is part of a bigger project, I believe it's one of the biggest D.O.D.",198,,
521,0.97,3014.711,3016.213,Projects in the region.,198,,
522,0.97,3016.213,3033.93,"We are Partnering with Lake Union partners to develop this underutilized, unused really three acres just south of the East link light rail station and hopefully the timing of this project will open up right when the East link light rail station opens up.",198,,
523,0.97,3033.93,3048.378,"Our goal is to create a mixed use, mixed income TOD community at the North end of the Ranier Valley where there really isn't kind of a focal point or an anchor for that community yet.",198,,
524,0.97,3048.378,3061.658,"We'd like to, obviously, do a Brownfield cleanup and then provide and connect open space and improve the pedestrians' experience along Ranier and 23rd to get to the light rail station.",198,,
525,0.97,3061.658,3077.474,"This is a really exciting project for the region, for the Ranier Valley and with the allocation it would definitely help the taxpayers in terms of less money, but also provide 45 more affordable units.",198,,
526,0.97,3077.474,3077.808,"Oh, sorry.",198,,
527,0.97,3077.808,3079.176,"Thank you, Conor.",199,,
528,0.97,3079.176,3089.085,"For the viewing public if they are following along with our agenda, it looks like this is presentation number two on the agenda, which is fine.",199,,
529,0.97,3089.085,3094.224,We can go through them as mt.,199,,
530,0.97,3094.224,3095.192,"Baker wishes, so please continue, Conor.",199,,
531,0.97,3095.192,3095.459,Yeah.,200,,
532,0.97,3095.459,3097.26,And I forgot to say next slide.,200,,
533,0.97,3097.26,3109.072,So a lot of what I said is here but here's a general idea of where the project is in relation to I-90 and future light rail station.,200,,
534,0.97,3109.072,3120.183,"And then there's just some numbers that--you know, the alley location has a dramatic effect on the amount of units but the ask of the city.",200,,
535,0.97,3120.183,3122.419,You're reading that correctly.,200,,
536,0.97,3122.419,3133.063,"We get 45 more units for 4.7 less million dollars from office housing, so I wanted to make that clear.",200,,
537,0.97,3133.063,3133.864,Next slide.,200,,
538,0.97,3133.864,3135.165,"Hi, everyone.",201,,
539,0.97,3135.165,3137.567,"My name is Melissa Wexler, one of the architects on the projects.",201,,
540,0.97,3137.567,3142.772,I'll walk you through the project fairly quickly so I am happy to answer questions at the end.,201,,
541,0.97,3142.772,3144.608,This aerial photograph shows where we are.,201,,
542,0.97,3144.608,3154.651,"At the top of the screen you can see I-90 and the location of the future Judkins light rail park station so we are very close to mass transit, which is great.",201,,
543,0.97,3154.651,3167.464,These are three Brownfield sites that are being RA Mediated with the Department of Ecology and there will be a significant influx of housing and other mixed use opportunities on these three blocks.,201,,
544,0.97,3167.464,3173.303,The neighborhood has a lot of access to outdoor green space.,201,,
545,0.97,3173.303,3176.74,You can see the park and the park northeast to the site.,201,,
546,0.97,3176.74,3180.877,Eclctic neighborhood right now.,201,,
547,0.97,3180.877,3184.781,A lot of the former industrial type buildings along Ranier are being changed now.,201,,
548,0.97,3184.781,3191.087,A lot of projects were in design or construction to make this more of a true mixed use corridor.,201,,
549,0.97,3191.087,3196.393,But there are also pockets of residential to the North of our site and then also to the east of 23rd Avenue.,201,,
550,0.97,3196.393,3201.631,So while there's a lot going on at the North end of the Ranier Valley there's actually not that much to walk to.,201,,
551,0.97,3201.631,3205.335,And that's something we have heard from the residents that we met with.,201,,
552,0.97,3205.335,3214.01,"You know, they would like to have places where they could walk and get a cup of coffee, drop off their Dry-Cleaning, really just those neighborhood services.",201,,
553,0.97,3214.01,3220.25,There isn't much of a center like that right now and we are hoping to provide that with this project.,201,,
554,0.97,3220.25,3220.55,Next slide.,201,,
555,0.97,3220.55,3235.031,"So this is a diagram we put together at the beginning of working on grand Street Commons trying to synthesize all the great opportunities we have for Brownfield remediation, transit oriented development and our connections to education and cultural amenities in the neighborhood.",201,,
556,0.97,3235.031,3246.843,"But what we really wanted to drive the point home was that not only is the South block 100% affordable, but of the 771 apartments proposed for these three blocks, 360 of them will be affordable.",201,,
557,0.97,3246.843,3255.085,The East and the West blocks are also participating in the Mha program and Mste.,201,,
558,0.97,3255.085,3263.727,"Mha will be installed on site so they are not paying in lieu of so this will be a true mixed use, mixed intent community.",201,,
559,0.97,3263.727,3264.26,Next slide.,201,,
560,0.97,3264.26,3291.554,"This slide summarizes the differences in efficiencies that we get by eliminating the alley and combining the two projects into one, so rather than having two separate lobby spaces, additional circulation and actually having to push the parking below grade, which is very expensive, we are able to combine and come up with a much more efficient building program that generates 45 additional units of housing at a lower cost to the office of housing.",201,,
561,0.97,3291.554,3291.855,Next slide.,201,,
562,0.97,3291.855,3297.494,We have already gone through our public trust review with the Seattle design Commission.,201,,
563,0.97,3297.494,3298.328,It was unanimously approved.,201,,
564,0.97,3298.328,3302.399,Primarily because this alley is not connecting to the rest of the neighborhood.,201,,
565,0.97,3302.399,3306.603,"You can see this diagram, our alley is shown dashed in in red.",201,,
566,0.97,3306.603,3317.814,"It's not part of a contiguous alley network so if it's removed, it will not impact or prohibit--throughout the neighborhood.",201,,
567,0.97,3317.814,3318.114,Next slide.,201,,
568,0.97,3318.114,3320.85,This is an aerial photograph of our site.,201,,
569,0.97,3320.85,3324.12,You can see our site is dashed in black.,201,,
570,0.97,3324.12,3330.026,We should mention that there is one other property owner on the block.,201,,
571,0.97,3330.026,3330.56,It's deer auto repair.,201,,
572,0.97,3330.56,3337.667,Currently they are using the South end of the alley as part of their overflow parking area for their private business.,201,,
573,0.97,3337.667,3341.338,The site itself is cleared and ready for remediation.,201,,
574,0.97,3341.338,3343.239,There's no access at the North end either.,201,,
575,0.97,3343.239,3346.409,It's actually fenced off with a Chain-Link fence at the moment.,201,,
576,0.97,3346.409,3360.957,The other important thing to note is that our site is nestled right near where 23rd Avenue comes South and then it's about to meet a point with Ranier and it's connected via grand street to the North and South Holgate street to the South.,201,,
577,0.97,3360.957,3375.772,"But one of the things we want to improve is you can see there are two points of connection to Ranier Avenue right now, there's Grand Street and then there's also the 22nd Avenue spur and there's a pedestrian Island with three mature Street trees in between those two.",201,,
578,0.97,3375.772,3387.317,"To improve safety and security in the neighborhood, we are proposing to condense those down Nto one point of vehicle connection.",201,,
579,0.97,3387.317,3387.65,Next slide.,201,,
580,0.97,3387.65,3387.984,Melissa.,202,,
581,0.97,3387.984,3388.218,Yes.,203,,
582,0.97,3388.218,3392.422,Could we go back to that previous slide?,204,,
583,0.97,3392.422,3392.689,Sure.,205,,
584,0.97,3392.689,3393.69,Thank you.,206,,
585,0.97,3393.69,3412.509,"And just for my colleagues, what was really--I know we weigh so many different things when we are talking about vacating rights away, in this case vacating an alley and one of the considerations is what does the fire Department think about it in terms of getting emergency vehicles.",206,,
586,0.97,3412.509,3415.245,That's a big issue in the University district.,206,,
587,0.97,3415.245,3422.719,This slide was really powerful in terms of showing that the alley is really not usable by emergency vehicles.,206,,
588,0.97,3422.719,3429.192,So we are not giving up that emergency vehicle access.,206,,
589,0.97,3429.192,3446.543,"So that's helpful, even previous slides on the public benefits and the number of affordable housing units is also very powerful but just from an other departments of city government, the fire Department, this is really powerful for me to see that we are not really--we are not giving up emergency access.",206,,
590,0.97,3446.543,3446.876,Thank you.,206,,
591,0.97,3446.876,3447.11,No.,207,,
592,0.97,3447.11,3447.277,No.,207,,
593,0.97,3447.277,3450.146,"Yes, Councilmember Strauss, did you have a question?",207,,
594,0.97,3450.146,3450.38,Yes.,208,,
595,0.97,3450.38,3450.78,"Thank you, chair.",208,,
596,0.97,3450.78,3451.08,Thank you.,208,,
597,0.97,3451.08,3465.662,"I'm not sure if this is a question for Conor or Melissa, from the last slide of this satellite picture, it looks as if the Alleyway may have been--I know it was Unapproved but was it unusable?",208,,
598,0.97,3465.662,3474.37,It looks as if on the North end of that slide the hedges blocked access to that space any how.,208,,
599,0.97,3474.37,3477.774,Was this previously vacated or was it just --,208,,
600,0.97,3477.774,3478.007,No.,209,,
601,0.97,3478.007,3486.649,It's a plotted alley that was never installed so there's actually a continuous curb along that North edge on grand street.,209,,
602,0.97,3486.649,3487.884,Great.,210,,
603,0.97,3487.884,3498.228,"So to the chair's point, this was never fully utilized by the public and the public is getting benefits by this formal vacation.",210,,
604,0.97,3498.228,3499.028,Is that a correct understanding?,210,,
605,0.97,3499.028,3500.73,Yes.,211,,
606,0.97,3500.73,3503.433,Thank you so much.,212,,
607,0.97,3503.433,3504.4,Yep.,213,,
608,0.97,3504.4,3505.201,Next slide.,214,,
609,0.97,3505.201,3505.501,Melissa.,215,,
610,0.97,3505.501,3506.503,Yes.,216,,
611,0.97,3506.503,3515.478,"Real quick, back on that slide, you reminded me of the question about--you said the 23rd Avenue spur on the right side of the photo.",217,,
612,0.97,3515.478,3521.251,Is that--are you--did you say you are removing those trees?,217,,
613,0.97,3521.251,3522.719,Is that part of --,217,,
614,0.97,3522.719,3523.386,No no.,218,,
615,0.97,3523.386,3534.631,We would like to get the trees but reduce the amount of vehicular space and increase the amount of pedestrian space so you will see that in our proposal.,218,,
616,0.97,3534.631,3535.231,Thank you.,219,,
617,0.97,3535.231,3535.498,Okay.,220,,
618,0.97,3535.498,3535.832,Next slide.,220,,
619,0.97,3535.832,3539.869,"So these two diagrams on the left, you see a diagram.",220,,
620,0.97,3539.869,3542.038,We do not vacate the alley.,220,,
621,0.97,3542.038,3548.211,"We install the alley running North, South through our block and we maintain the street alignment the way they are currently.",220,,
622,0.97,3548.211,3550.647,"All of that pink, salmon kind of color shows vehicular space.",220,,
623,0.97,3550.647,3553.65,And there's not a lot of area left over for pedestrian space.,220,,
624,0.97,3553.65,3558.788,You can see that kind of yellow Úoval that we have Diagramed in there.,220,,
625,0.97,3558.788,3577.874,"What we are proposing to do and this is a great opportunity since we have control over all three of these blocks, we can actually implement the Right-Of- way development on both the North and the South side of Grand Street and that gives us the opportunity to really make some Preed significant modifications that should enhance the pedestrian realm.",220,,
626,0.97,3577.874,3589.385,"So the right-hand side with the alley vacation, what we are proposing to do is Realign grand Street and basically eliminate the spur Street connection so there's only one point of connection to Ranier.",220,,
627,0.97,3589.385,3598.227,What this does is it gives us two nice pedestrian plot of spaces on either side of the vehicular roadway.,220,,
628,0.97,3598.227,3618.114,"And it also allows us to soften the curve of Grand Street so when drivers come through here, they understand this is not a place to speed through and cut through real quickly, but that is a place that is dedicated to retail commercial use and pedestrian use.",220,,
629,0.97,3618.114,3618.414,Next slide.,220,,
630,0.97,3618.414,3624.654,"Before the pandemic, we were able to actually host an In- person open house and get to meet with neighbors face to face, which was great.",220,,
631,0.97,3624.654,3637.6,"And at that time a lot of what we heard was concerned about safety and security and then also, what I mentioned before, just the ability to walk through the neighborhood and access just basic neighborhood services that they feel they were lacking.",220,,
632,0.97,3637.6,3647.677,Since that time we have reached out to several of the local groups and haven't had a great amount of success having smaller group meetings but we have had a lot of feedback via Online survey.,220,,
633,0.97,3647.677,3653.883,"So what we have asked the neighbors on the survey is, you know, what's most important to you with these projects?",220,,
634,0.97,3653.883,3656.919,And overwhelmingly having more affordable housing was their priority.,220,,
635,0.97,3656.919,3666.596,There have been a lot of new Townhouse developments and other things coming into the neighborhood but not a lot of it is affordable so that's their main priority.,220,,
636,0.97,3666.596,3672.835,"They asked for an engaging pedestrian experience, so building on that, we asked them, if you have a Plaza, what would you like to see there?",220,,
637,0.97,3672.835,3681.01,"More green space was the number one thing, more green space and trees and then pedestrian lighting and I think that goes back to that idea of safety and security in the neighborhood.",220,,
638,0.97,3681.01,3688.985,There are also some other activating uses that we are exploring with the neighborhood feedback as well.,220,,
639,0.97,3688.985,3689.318,Next slide.,220,,
640,0.97,3689.318,3691.721,"So this is our preliminary site plan, what we are working with now.",220,,
641,0.97,3691.721,3704.1,"You can see how grand Street has been realigned with this proposal so it's a significant investment that the project is looking to make in the Right-Of- way to enhance it, not just for these three buildings, but also for the neighborhood at large.",220,,
642,0.97,3704.1,3715.912,Some of the things that we are proposing to do would be to enhance the paving patterns in the Plaza so it really provides a sense of place.,220,,
643,0.97,3715.912,3717.947,Influence in this area with activating uses.,220,,
644,0.97,3717.947,3724.62,You can see there's a number two and sort of a bluish circle on the upper left-hand side of the page in the middle of a Plaza.,220,,
645,0.97,3724.62,3725.221,"Yes, right there.",220,,
646,0.97,3725.221,3737.834,"So we are considering putting in a water Fountain, a water feature that Woud be able to be shut off at times, say if the neighborhood wanted to use this Plaza space for a gathering like a farmers market or some other community event.",220,,
647,0.97,3737.834,3742.638,It could be shut off so it could be just occupied space.,220,,
648,0.97,3742.638,3746.843,But something that would provide noise and interest maybe for families to come down and use the Plaza.,220,,
649,0.97,3746.843,3748.611,It's one of the things we are thinking about.,220,,
650,0.97,3748.611,3752.048,We are definitely going to put a lot of feeding in the Plaza.,220,,
651,0.97,3752.048,3760.89,That's something the neighborhood has asked for and increase the canopy cover with additional Street trees.,220,,
652,0.97,3760.89,3761.224,Next slide.,220,,
653,0.97,3761.224,3781.11,"So the building itself will be 202 apartments and I think one of the things we are most excited about is it's got space for family style units so we have over 43 bedroom apartments here which is really unique, not just in this neighborhood but throughout the whole city so that's something that as an architect I'm excited we are able to make that happen.",220,,
654,0.97,3781.11,3793.589,And Co nor talked about the benefits of the cost for office of housing but INS a rendering of the North facade with our main building entry along grand street.,220,,
655,0.97,3793.589,3794.056,Next slide.,220,,
656,0.97,3794.056,3804.634,This is kind of a before and after sketch of that pedestrian Island with the existing Street trees on the left and you can see how there are streets around it.,220,,
657,0.97,3804.634,3815.178,"What we are proposing to do is close that off, make this much more of a pedestrian space with plazas on other side.",220,,
658,0.97,3815.178,3815.478,Next slide.,220,,
659,0.97,3815.478,3828.324,"To wrap it up, we are getting into our public benefit proposal so in addition to the affordable housing, our main effort will be installing the plazas and realigning the streets, fairly significant capital cost.",220,,
660,0.97,3828.324,3836.532,"But in addition to provide a sense of place and speak to the safety and security, we are proposing to have supplemental lighting.",220,,
661,0.97,3836.532,3842.038,You can see some illustrations or some photographs of what the lights will look like.,220,,
662,0.97,3842.038,3845.775,This neighborhood used to be referred to as the Gulch.,220,,
663,0.97,3845.775,3853.583,"There's a large Italian community that lived here, mostly before I-90 came through and disrupted the neighborhood.",220,,
664,0.97,3853.583,3859.856,But we are looking at garlic bulbs as inspiration for how we can execute that lighting in a sculptural way.,220,,
665,0.97,3859.856,3864.327,And then we are also still looking through different activating uses.,220,,
666,0.97,3864.327,3869.765,"As I mentioned, a fountain would be one of the ideas, definitely some seating.",220,,
667,0.97,3869.765,3877.373,But been feedback from the community about installing gaming tables or some other play spaces for children too.,220,,
668,0.97,3877.373,3877.707,Last slide.,220,,
669,0.97,3877.707,3882.311,And this is a rendering that shows what this Plaza could look and feel like with our building in the background.,220,,
670,0.97,3882.311,3886.282,"So we are standing on Ranier Avenue, looking to the East.",220,,
671,0.97,3886.282,3906.702,"You can see mt . Baker's building with the kind of curved form at the top and the brick base with the lighting proposed, the suggestion of a fountain in the background and a lot of people Greenery coming in to make this a nice neighborhood destination.",220,,
672,0.97,3906.702,3907.003,That's all.,220,,
673,0.97,3907.003,3908.304,Thank you.,220,,
674,0.97,3908.304,3911.807,Thank you very much.,221,,
675,0.97,3911.807,3914.21,"Colleagues, any questions for the nonprofit developers?",221,,
676,0.97,3914.21,3921.651,"And then we also have, I know he's trying to be below the radar screen but we also have Michael Jenkins here in case we have any questions for him.",221,,
677,0.97,3921.651,3926.422,I might have a question for him.,221,,
678,0.97,3926.422,3935.031,Any questions for mt . Baker housing on this amazing project?,221,,
679,0.97,3935.031,3937.533,I do have a question for Michael.,221,,
680,0.97,3937.533,3938.034,"Good morning, Michael.",221,,
681,0.97,3938.034,3943.105,Thanks for joining us from the design Commission.,221,,
682,0.97,3943.105,3943.94,Good morning.,222,,
683,0.97,3943.94,3958.02,"For this project, what is the type of--we are here for the alley vacation But while you're here, what is the type of design Commission, what level of design Commission review is this project undergoing?",223,,
684,0.97,3958.02,3962.658,Because there's lots of discussions about different levels and exemptions and appreciate that.,223,,
685,0.97,3962.658,3964.76,Sure.,224,,
686,0.97,3964.76,3965.561,Can you hear me okay?,224,,
687,0.97,3965.561,3965.795,Great.,224,,
688,0.97,3965.795,3975.705,"I did have a brief presentation if that would be helpful on the first slide, actually, shows our involvement and the status.",224,,
689,0.97,3975.705,3985.981,"And if you can go to the next, please.",224,,
690,0.97,3985.981,3986.315,Thank you.,225,,
691,0.97,3986.315,3990.92,"Could go to the next slide, Shawna.",226,,
692,0.97,3990.92,3991.153,Great.,226,,
693,0.97,3991.153,4016.979,"When the design Commission--the design commissions involved in alley vacations throughout the process and this graph shows you where the design Commission involvement begins and that's really at the very beginning of the project, before any design review or entitlement, land use entitlements takes place, as well as before the petition is filed.",226,,
694,0.97,4016.979,4028.057,We did conduct a Prepetition review before design review commenced and before the petition was filed to Sdot and you can see where we are now relative to that process.,226,,
695,0.97,4028.057,4034.53,Does the graphic help explain that?,226,,
696,0.97,4034.53,4034.764,Yes.,227,,
697,0.97,4034.764,4035.064,Great.,228,,
698,0.97,4035.064,4040.202,"If I could go to the next slide, Shawna.",228,,
699,0.97,4040.202,4056.152,"So at the Prepetition review in November of 2019, I think the Commission flagged some My- level concerns about how South grand would function, if it's closed off in favor of the 22nd Avenue spur that Melissa showed you.",228,,
700,0.97,4056.152,4069.865,And I think just general concerns about the location of the public space on Ranier and how it would appear actually public as opposed to an extension of the commercial or retail space.,228,,
701,0.97,4069.865,4081.977,And I think also the Commission was concerned about the extent to which the spaces that were being created reflect local community preference policies.,228,,
702,0.97,4081.977,4091.187,"Again, we did that review, we provided the review to the applicants before the formal petition process started.",228,,
703,0.97,4091.187,4095.724,"Could I have the next slide, Shawna.",228,,
704,0.97,4095.724,4099.428,So Melissa spoke to this a bit.,228,,
705,0.97,4099.428,4103.499,"The Commission did vote unanimously to support public trust, which is the first phase.",228,,
706,0.97,4103.499,4112.441,"And that being that if you take that alley out of service, how are the remaining functions of the alley addressed?",228,,
707,0.97,4112.441,4126.622,"And again, I think the biggest concern that the Commission had wasn't necessarily the removal of the alley because I think it's clear that it really doesn't provide much function at all and it certainly isn't approved.",228,,
708,0.97,4126.622,4135.131,And I think the Commission recognized that the additional units that would be created are much more efficient and make much more sense with the loss of the alley.,228,,
709,0.97,4135.131,4149.945,"They were concerned, though, that the size and the scale of the building that results from the alley vacation, that there could be additional design solutions to reduce the overall bulk and scale of that building.",228,,
710,0.97,4149.945,4166.428,"But again, I think the Commission also flagged, again, the identity and function of that open space as being public as opposed to an extension of the uses of the--that are in the commercial and retail spaces.",228,,
711,0.97,4166.428,4177.106,"And also kind of--you know, sort of the larger problem of safe crossing to the site from the Abutting arterial.",228,,
712,0.97,4177.106,4192.621,"Both Ranier and 23rd are--carry significant amount of traffic and the Commission was concerned if the public would be utilizing the space, how would they pass through those Arterials.",228,,
713,0.97,4192.621,4194.823,"Can I have the next slide, Shawna.",228,,
714,0.97,4194.823,4203.399,At that meeting in November the Commission did flag some issues with the public benefits package that was Previewed.,228,,
715,0.97,4203.399,4216.912,"I think you have heard--again, the concern about the open space, and particular its proximity to Ranier Avenue South and, again, that location in relationship to commercial space.",228,,
716,0.97,4216.912,4232.761,And also I think there's a lot of concern about the nature of the grand Street alignment and how that functions as part of the larger public space and its relationship to the open space.,228,,
717,0.97,4232.761,4245.007,"What we typically do is we--when issues like this are flagged and raised, we will hold what's called a subcommittee and we do that before they come back to the next full Commission meeting.",228,,
718,0.97,4245.007,4278.173,"So there's a focused review about the issues that were raised by the Commission and they can meet informally with the team and really roll up their sleeves and figure out ways to resolve the issues that were raised in a way that works both with the development team, but also I think works with the Commission and having a better understanding how the community actually benefits from that public benefit proposal and how it reflects community desire and expectation.",228,,
719,0.97,4278.173,4294.99,"And I will say at this point, you know, the Commission has a lot of confidence that this team will be able to address those issues and present those solutions in a way, you said it, Councilmember, when you talked, this is an a team and it's a pleasure to work with them.",228,,
720,0.97,4294.99,4312.841,I am confident they will be able to address what are important issues but one that I think elevates the identity and function of those open spaces in a way that truly provides public space for the community.,228,,
721,0.97,4312.841,4314.209,"Thank you, director Jenkins.",229,,
722,0.97,4314.209,4315.844,This is very helpful.,229,,
723,0.97,4315.844,4342.171,I think it shows that the benefit in a lot of cases of the design Commission process that we have to point out things where we can create a Win-Win situation for all our different Stakeholders and see things from different angles that maybe the real estate developer by themselves might not see otherwise without the input.,229,,
724,0.97,4342.171,4344.64,So thank you.,229,,
725,0.97,4344.64,4347.743,"Colleagues, any questions for director Jenkins or for developers?",229,,
726,0.97,4347.743,4348.31,Councilmember Herbold.,229,,
727,0.97,4348.31,4348.677,Thank you.,230,,
728,0.97,4348.677,4376.972,"I want to say the focus on making sure that the public benefits are truly public benefits and not building amenities is very elevated for me, given the presentation that we just received about the community input and the importance of the--that the broader community placed on these very elements that you are now Critiquing, so thank you.",230,,
729,0.97,4376.972,4382.444,"So colleagues, again, we will be able to hear--we will hear more about this item as it proceeds.",231,,
730,0.97,4382.444,4395.39,But really want to thank the colleagues who came before us who helped set up this process whereby we do get to learn about these projects earlier when there's a street vacation or alley vacation.,231,,
731,0.97,4395.39,4409.738,"As I understand it, and as I recall from years ago, these alley vacations would happen very quickly and we have now extra chance to weigh in and understand and absorb the project and ask questions.",231,,
732,0.97,4409.738,4417.446,So appreciate the former Council colleagues and others who help set up that process.,231,,
733,0.97,4417.446,4417.98,Councilmember Strauss.,231,,
734,0.97,4417.98,4427.422,"Just again, wanted to thank everyone for their presentations and director Jenkins, thank you for your input here.",232,,
735,0.97,4427.422,4435.364,City grind down and John but really great to see your face today for the first time since the pandemic started.,232,,
736,0.97,4435.364,4435.864,"Thanks, everybody.",233,,
737,0.97,4435.864,4442.805,"So again, we will hear more about this item later and thank you to Sdot also for being here.",233,,
738,0.97,4442.805,4444.339,"Hi, Beverly.",233,,
739,0.97,4444.339,4444.907,Good to see you.,233,,
740,0.97,4444.907,4445.207,Thank you.,233,,
741,0.97,4445.207,4449.578,So we will hear more about this item later.,233,,
742,0.97,4449.578,4451.947,Thanks for everybody being here.,233,,
743,0.97,4451.947,4457.419,"Colleagues, this concludes our December 16, 2020 meeting of the transportation and utilities committee.",233,,
744,0.97,4457.419,4461.056,The committee will meet again on January 20th in the afternoon.,233,,
745,0.97,4461.056,4465.06,While we are enjoying the inauguration in the morning of January 20th.,233,,
746,0.97,4465.06,4467.095,"So everybody, thank you for attending and we are adjourned.",233,,
