21,0.97,49.549,63.696,"Silent on allowing electronic participation at Council briefing meetings to continue participating remotely, I'll move to suspend the Council rules through may 31st, 2020, to allow this meeting to occur while participating through electronic means.",20,,
22,0.97,63.696,99.566,"Of course, this is in reaction to the recent announcement by Governor Inslee extending his Stay-At-Home, stay healthy order for the state of Washington and to be consistent with that and to be consistent with Mayor Durkan's communication related to the same issue and extending Telecommute opportunities and Telework opportunities for all Seattle workers through may 31st, 2020, now also extending those policies through this rule suspension.",20,,

27,0.97,131.364,154.42,"Again, quickly moving to President's report, I'll make it short, consistent with the memo I sent out yesterday, the legislative Department Teleworking practice has been extended until May 31st, 2020, the Timeline is compatible with the governor's stay home, stay healthy proclamation and the Teleworking policy.",20,,
28,0.97,154.42,161.027,"If you have any questions or concerns, please let me know.",20,,
29,0.97,161.027,229.062,"We can expect additional detailed updates as soon as we move forward about how we can hope to be able to look at and start framing potential return to city hall in the coming months and so I have already asked the city clerk and fines administrative services to start thinking through a plan for the needs, potentially to reopen Council chambers and also for the need to address the potential return of some individuals to the second and third floor of the legislative Department, so more to come, no decisions, I want to make sure we engage with all of the folks that need to be engaged with before we formalize any return to work opportunities and ongoing conversations with you all and with our operational staff around how to best accomplish that in a way that is consistent with public, ongoing public health recommendations in this space.",20,,
30,0.97,229.062,233.333,That is the conclusion of my President's report.,20,,
31,0.97,233.333,237.57,Happy to take any questions about that.,20,,
32,0.97,237.57,246.012,"Hearing none, we'll move right into a preview of the city actions and work on regional committees.",20,,
33,0.97,246.012,256.356,I'm going to call on Councilmembers in a roll call for city council meetings.,20,,
34,0.97,256.356,265.598,"First we'll hear from Councilmember Sawant, Herbold, Lewis, Morales, Mosqueda and I'll conclude the agenda discussion for today.",20,,
35,0.97,265.598,268.568,We don't have any presentations.,20,,
36,0.97,268.568,290.79,"I'm hoping we can get through today's presentation as quickly as possible because I know there are some lingering legislative items that need to happen between now and noon, so I am going to go ahead and hand it over to Councilmember Sawant.",20,,
37,0.97,290.79,291.224,The floor is yours.,20,,
38,0.97,291.224,296.029,There are no items on the agenda.,21,,
39,0.97,296.029,330.73,"On Friday, may 1ST, international worker's day, may day, my office joined community organizations and activists and very successful socially distanced for our car vain and bike protest against the Amazon movement we have brought forward I encourage Councilmembers to watch the Video of the demonstration we live streamed during the event and find it on my Council office's Youtube or Facebook page.",21,,
40,0.97,330.73,393.96,"The speakers who spoke at the rallies, Online rallies, why are Amazon taxes so necessary for our communities, not only to provide assistance to workers, reestablish public jobs program to hire tens of thousands of people and to carry out green new deal, building Retrofits and other programs, and also, Paramount point that was made by speakers is that given the cities and States dubious distinction of the nation's aggressive tax system, not only is it unjust that the working people have the burden of revenues but now we'll face an even brutal question is that when we have widespread joblessness which we have seen the projections are that we're heading into a deep recession with massive joblessness, for a Regrisive tax system that Im replies a plummeting of revenues, that is a mathematical sequence.",21,,
41,0.97,393.96,408.341,Any refusal from the political establishment to tax big business and the wealthy will mean budget short falls and budget cuts unless we short up on revenues and increase public revenues.,21,,
42,0.97,408.341,410.977,I was struck by how many people participated.,21,,
43,0.97,410.977,415.548,I saw many new faces and incredible energy in the demonstration.,21,,
44,0.97,415.548,420.52,"At the same time, overwhelmingly, the serious approach to maintain social distancing to keep the communities safe.",21,,
45,0.97,420.52,429.061,It was a good example of how we can have democratically organized protest actions but in a safe way.,21,,
46,0.97,429.061,454.32,"Just last point, we're beginning the movement to organize district based town halls that community organizers are leading from each district and I know that UAW 4121 and others have invited Councilmembers Pedersen and Lewis for district 4 and District 7 town hall community town hall tomorrow at 6:00 P.M ..",21,,
47,0.97,454.32,463.429,I believe Gonzalez and Mosqueda have also been invited.,21,,
48,0.97,463.429,466.699,I would urge Councilmembers to hear.,21,,
49,0.97,466.699,471.003,Thank you for that report.,22,,
50,0.97,471.003,476.943,Any questions or comments on Councilmember Sawant's report?,22,,
51,0.97,476.943,477.944,Okay.,22,,
52,0.97,477.944,486.185,"Hearing and seeing none, we'll move through the rest of the list here, so next up is Councilmember Strauss, the floor is yours.",22,,
53,0.97,486.185,492.992,"Yes, good morning and my apologies for the technical difficulties.",23,,
54,0.97,492.992,496.095,I'm participating by phone while on a computer.,23,,
55,0.97,496.095,497.864,Audio is not working as well.,23,,
56,0.97,497.864,507.573,There are zero items from the land use and neighborhood's community on the agenda and zero from the land use and neighborhood's community for the calendar.,23,,
57,0.97,507.573,520.119,"I have another round of weekly office hours over the phone this last week and have held meetings, spoken with or scheduled a meeting with everyone who requested a meeting this last year.",23,,
58,0.97,520.119,526.525,We made changes on how we respond to E-Mails and phone calls we receive so we're Proactively offering them a meeting with me.,23,,
59,0.97,526.525,547.58,"As you may remember from last week, my staff worked with small business groups, other interested parties, and all of the Council offices on a letter to state and Federal officials regarding the ways in which the levels of government can step up to support our local establishments.",23,,
60,0.97,547.58,561.861,I didn't have one question for Councilmember Pedersen I'll follow up with after this call and then we'll send that letter around again and we look forward to bringing that to full Council for signature this afternoon.,23,,
61,0.97,561.861,574.307,My office continues to provide direct support and guidance to small businesses and Non-Profits on how to best navigate the support programs that are involved.,23,,
62,0.97,574.307,587.019,"Another update from the Commons Park, as of this weekend, there was notice posted for an encampment removal.",23,,
63,0.97,587.019,591.891,It was posted less than the 72 hours.,23,,
64,0.97,591.891,598.264,The guidance about encampment removal requires notice be provided no fewer than 72 hours.,23,,
65,0.97,598.264,606.238,This occurred within 48 hours of the encampment removal that occurred.,23,,
66,0.97,606.238,614.547,Encampment Removals that push people out of the community without addressing the under lying Association is not in line with my values.,23,,
67,0.97,614.547,628.561,My calling for urgency and resources over the last several weeks and before the Covid pandemic began are because I also understand the need of adjacent residence to have relief from living next to an unmanaged encampment.,23,,
68,0.97,628.561,631.364,We have to manage the public space.,23,,
69,0.97,631.364,635.368,We had success with increased access to hygiene and cleaner and better maintained park.,23,,
70,0.97,635.368,640.206,These are the steps we have to make as we move people into shelter.,23,,
71,0.97,640.206,645.778,Navigation had moved 17 people out of the park into 24/7 shelter as of last Wednesday.,23,,
72,0.97,645.778,652.251,We need to manage this public space and we haven't.,23,,
73,0.97,652.251,654.954,"Initial success, access to hygiene and better maintained park.",23,,
74,0.97,654.954,666.198,Where we failed is providing law enforcement the tools they need to address and intervene predatory behavior as we deployed the necessary resources to stabilize the people who are trying to get off the streets.,23,,
75,0.97,666.198,676.175,"Again, on Saturday, may 2ND, a notice was distributed and indicated an encampment removal would occur this Monday, may 4TH at 9:00 A.M ..",23,,
76,0.97,676.175,684.283,This did not meet the notice requirements of providing notice no fewer than 72 hours for an encampment remove Yafl.,23,,
77,0.97,684.283,690.523,They were stopped in the 11th week of this year due to the pandemic.,23,,
78,0.97,690.523,698.898,"In the first ten weeks of this year, there were seven encampment Removals within an hour of the Commons park.",23,,
79,0.97,698.898,705.538,"Simply put, this means that every week we push people from one place to another without addressing the under lying issues.",23,,
80,0.97,705.538,707.573,This is not in line with my values.,23,,
81,0.97,707.573,720.352,Pushing people from one place to another into our green spaces and our industrial areas and other resident's front yards exacerbates the problem we're trying to address and does not provide interventions.,23,,
82,0.97,720.352,728.661,"By the end of this conversation, there will be more tents on the Seaview Avenue and in the green spaces.",23,,
83,0.97,728.661,749.982,"Again, we need to use strategies that do not require us to come back week after week to push people around because pushing people from one place to another is again, not in line with my values or provides a meaningful intervention into the under lying issues people are facing and our community is facing.",23,,
84,0.97,749.982,751.283,"Thank you, Council President.",23,,
85,0.97,751.283,757.089,"Thank you, Councilmember Strauss for that report and those important words.",24,,
86,0.97,757.089,760.86,Are there any comments or questions for Councilmember Strauss?,24,,
87,0.97,760.86,763.095,I see a couple of hands going up.,24,,
88,0.97,763.095,766.599,I want to add something but I'll wait.,24,,
89,0.97,766.599,772.805,I'll allow the colleagues to go first.,24,,
90,0.97,772.805,775.074,Councilmember Herbold followed by Lewis.,24,,
91,0.97,775.074,777.81,Thank you very much.,25,,
92,0.97,777.81,783.649,Thank you for that update in your engagement on the issue and letting us know where you stand.,25,,
93,0.97,783.649,831.197,"I have heard over the weekend that prior to this action on behalf of the city to begin the steps necessary to take an encampment removal, that prior to that decision, there was an agreement both on the part of Co-Lead, the lead program focused on Covid-19 responses, and the community, that they were going to engage the residents of the encampment and it actually have secured significant resources to house people as well as their state of the art case management services.",25,,
94,0.97,831.197,836.335,What can you tell us about that?,25,,
95,0.97,836.335,842.374,I don't know where that conversation stands with other parts of our city government.,26,,
96,0.97,842.374,857.156,What I can say is that we need to provide solutions at the scale of the problem that we're facing and that means bringing people inside with low or no barrier shelter that is connected with case management.,26,,
97,0.97,857.156,869.535,"If that means, and I have called previous to this for the ability to bring people into hotel rooms and provide them case management and this, I believe, is the solution that we should be taking.",26,,
98,0.97,869.535,871.837,"All right, well, thank you, again, Councilmember Strauss.",27,,
99,0.97,871.837,875.174,I just want to put a finer point on this.,27,,
100,0.97,875.174,911.944,"I believe that prior to the decision to remove the encampment, there was an agreement with the Ballard community, particularly the business district, that they were going to avail themselves and allow the community to avail itself of the services of Co-Lead to help the individuals and now because of the encampment removal decision, that agreement is no longer in place and those services will not be provided to this Cohort of individuals.",27,,
101,0.97,911.944,919.485,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold for those questions, really important line of Councilmember Lewis, I'll go ahead and hand it over to you.",28,,
102,0.97,919.485,928.761,"Thank you so much, Madam President, and thank you, Councilmember Strauss, and Councilmember Herbold, for your comments.",29,,
103,0.97,928.761,938.037,So I did send an E-mail this morning in advance of the briefing making inquiries to the Mayor's office on some of the details of this removal.,29,,
104,0.97,938.037,946.712,I have received some information that I just wanted to relay to inform the conversation.,29,,
105,0.97,946.712,953.719,"First that everybody who has been contacted, that Ballard conference has been given an offer of shelter in enhanced shelter.",29,,
106,0.97,953.719,961.627,That is the first thing I wanted to relay.,29,,
107,0.97,961.627,974.306,"There was no announcement on whether this represents a broader shift from kind of the stated parameters of where the navigation team stands at this time, but I'll continue to make inquiries.",29,,
108,0.97,974.306,983.215,Obviously my most urgent was what is the nature of shelter being offered to being that are removed.,29,,
109,0.97,983.215,994.526,"I'm assured there is capacity for 100% offers for folks for enhanced shelter but of course, throughout today, I'll continue to follow up to get more information.",29,,
110,0.97,994.526,1003.669,"I learned about this removal for the first time via Twitter, so I think we're all in a place where we're working to catch up to it.",29,,
111,0.97,1003.669,1010.309,I can say that I did personally visit the Ballard Commons a couple of weeks ago.,29,,
112,0.97,1010.309,1026.358,"That particular encampment was in a really difficult state in terms of posing public health challenges to the rest of the neighborhood, so some kind of intervention, it was certainly warranted.",29,,
113,0.97,1026.358,1037.87,I have had similar conversations to what Councilmember Herbold eluded to with the Co-Lead program and have been talking with Lisa Dugard.,29,,
114,0.97,1037.87,1048.447,That is to say that I think that we have to really Revisit some of the conversations that we have been having as a Council.,29,,
115,0.97,1048.447,1076.575,"I know Councilmember Mosqueda, Councilmember Herbold, Councilmember Strauss and I have been talking about the expanded use of hotel rooms, case work, strategies to reduce the ever increasing number of Unsanctioned Encampments throughout the city and get people inside, get people services, get people in a place where they can be living with dignity and actually practicing the public health guidelines that they have been told to follow from the governor and from the city.",29,,
116,0.97,1076.575,1083.015,So I'm going to work today to get more information on this removal.,29,,
117,0.97,1083.015,1088.086,The top line data that I have gotten so far is there are universal offers of shelter being made.,29,,
118,0.97,1088.086,1090.656,I did just want to relay that.,29,,
119,0.97,1090.656,1097.563,"As I get more information, I will certainly circulate and share it to Council colleagues.",29,,
120,0.97,1097.563,1101.099,"Thank you Councilmember Lewis, for that additional information.",30,,
121,0.97,1101.099,1118.283,"Colleagues, anyone else have any questions or comments on the issue that was flagged by Councilmember Strauss?",30,,
122,0.97,1118.283,1118.75,Councilmember Sawant?,30,,
123,0.97,1118.75,1119.084,Thank you.,31,,
124,0.97,1119.084,1122.221,I appreciate Councilmembers mentioning this in briefing.,31,,
125,0.97,1122.221,1133.699,"I know that Councilmember Strauss talked about hotel rooms and other solutions, which of course, all of which I would strongly support based on the track record of my Council office.",31,,
126,0.97,1133.699,1152.151,"I also think, though, if we're talking about, honestly talking about solutions for the scale of the problem, we can't address problem one without the Council taking a strong position against Sweeps on our homeless neighbors as a whole.",31,,
127,0.97,1152.151,1178.043,"Most importantly, without addressing the need for affordable housing, rent control, publicly owned affordable housing at the scale of the problem we face and that is why I think a lot of these questions that are coming up with going to converge on the question of whether the Council has the courage to have access to make the funding available for affordable housing and other services.",31,,
128,0.97,1178.043,1178.343,Thank you.,31,,
129,0.97,1178.343,1180.812,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant.",32,,
130,0.97,1180.812,1187.719,Any other questions or comments for Councilmember Strauss?,32,,
131,0.97,1187.719,1189.354,I'm not seeing any.,32,,
132,0.97,1189.354,1270.369,"Councilmember Strauss, I was, I just have a couple of questions and I want to see if you have posed these questions or if you have any additional information around these particular points, so the human services Department, in a post date EED March 17th, 2020, on their Website, you know, went through the process of providing an update on what the city's efforts would be around expanding shelter, hygiene, and out reach to individuals experiencing homelessness, specifically in the context of the Coronavirus disease, so I think it is really important for us to root the comments that you have made, Councilmember Strauss, not just in the sort of ordinary, you know, day-to-day context, but the reality is that this sweep is being done during the Covid-19 pandemic and the human services Department on their Website made representations to us and to the general public about how they would be approaching Unsanctioned Encampments in the specific context of Covid-19 and this pandemic, and in that context, they say two things I'll read directly from the Website.",32,,
133,0.97,1270.369,1283.882,"First, the navigation along with the parks and recreation, police Department and other city partners will continue to pause 72-Hour Removals and will pause obstruction operations to Prioritize Covid-19 out reach.",32,,
134,0.97,1283.882,1295.16,"The team will continue to remove waste, garbage, and debris from unmanaged Encampments to reduce public health risks in unmanaged Encampments.",32,,
135,0.97,1295.16,1323.321,"Post continues to say no such Removals will continue during the public health emergency unless, unless needed for an extreme circumstance that presents a significant barrier to accessibility of city streets and sidewalks and is an extraordinary public safety hazard that puts people living unsheltered or others at risk, individuals in all of the cases will be offered shelter.",32,,
136,0.97,1323.321,1338.57,"I guess my question is, and I have heard from Councilmember Lewis, that the executive said 100% have been offered shelter.",32,,
137,0.97,1338.57,1362.294,"Factors or criteria being met, that one, they're claiming, has been met, but do you have any information, Councilmember Strauss, around what efforts the navigation team made to, quote, continue to remove waste, garbage, and debris from unmanaged encampment, at Ballard Commons park?",32,,
138,0.97,1362.294,1363.228,That is my first question.,32,,
139,0.97,1363.228,1386.585,"Second, do you have any information from the executive about why--what set of facts they are claiming that rises to the occasion of saying that this is an extreme circumstance that allows them to sort of deviate from their stated policy of no Removals during this period of time?",32,,
140,0.97,1386.585,1405.871,What facts have they been given you that this has risen to the stance of the extreme circumstance that is an extraordinary public safety hazard that puts people living unsheltered or others at risk?,32,,
141,0.97,1405.871,1406.671,"Thank you, Council President.",33,,
142,0.97,1406.671,1430.996,"What I can say and what I said earlier in my comments is that this could have really been an--for the navigation team because for the last ten days, they have provided direct referrals into shelter and as of last Wednesday, there were 17 people referred into 24/7 shelter.",33,,
143,0.97,1430.996,1442.073,"This was inclusive of doing debris removal, sanitation, removing, you know, servicing the trash cans and the garbage at a higher rate.",33,,
144,0.97,1442.073,1449.214,I want to frame this as a month ago when we began this conversation about Ballard Commons park.,33,,
145,0.97,1449.214,1459.958,"The hepatitis a spike and what is occurring across our city, that the situation of Ballard common park was untenable.",33,,
146,0.97,1459.958,1485.65,"With the city's resources coming in to address that sanitation, getting people inside, and increased police presence, we were able to make a difference and the navigation team in its best role is set up with the resources it needs, which is access to shelter and the ability to refer people into shelter.",33,,
147,0.97,1485.65,1489.454,"I do not have, as you requested, facts regarding the extreme circumstances.",33,,
148,0.97,1489.454,1524.289,What I can tell you is that we also have not provided our law enforcement the tools that they need to be successful in this situation because we need law enforcement to be a partner in our diversion programs so that people are able to walk through the steps they need to do to intervene and provide them the support and the resources they need to have success.,33,,
149,0.97,1524.289,1527.392,There is a law enforcement aspect to that.,33,,
150,0.97,1527.392,1540.639,We need to have programs that tie our law enforcement with our diversion programs and that is where we failed in this situation.,33,,
151,0.97,1540.639,1587.419,"So I think I appreciate that additional information and I guess what I'm concerned about is that we have the multiple disciplinary rules around Encampments that exist during normal times, which I think are officially over and have been for awhile, and we have now seen a policy put out, a shift in policy put out by the human services Department that modifies that original policy to require something more extraordinary than what we normally see in some Unsanctioned Encampments whether it is Ballard common parks or anywhere else.",34,,
152,0.97,1587.419,1610.208,"I guess I'm concerned based on any information that you have shared or information Councilmember Lewis has shared so far, I have questions about whether there was compliance with the services Department, with the newly stated policy that crime is now in place.",34,,
153,0.97,1610.208,1631.162,"At city Council, we're charged primarily with the role of over sight and policy direction and if there has been noncompliance with a stated policy, then I think it is incumbent upon us to hold the executive accountable to the policy they claim to have in place.",34,,
154,0.97,1631.162,1639.337,The consequences here are severe as you articulated.,34,,
155,0.97,1639.337,1656.788,This is in order to strike a balance between people's constitutional right to exist in an environment where they don't have appropriate shelter and balance that out with some of the needs of those in the surrounding community.,34,,
156,0.97,1656.788,1697.262,"Those are important constitutional principles that we have to uphold and if there has been an issue with that, as it relates to either this encampment or anywhere else in the city, then I think it is important that we put our finger on the pulse of that and begin to dig in on how to correct course so that we are funding and supporting the use of more appropriate diversion tools that will actually address the needs of the people who are experiencing homelessness in these Unsanctioned and unmanaged Encampments.",34,,
157,0.97,1697.262,1703.068,I agree and I share your concerns.,35,,
158,0.97,1703.068,1703.735,"Thank you, Council President.",35,,
159,0.97,1703.735,1705.837,"Councilmember Lewis, I see you have raised your hand.",36,,
160,0.97,1705.837,1707.272,"Thank you, Council President.",37,,
161,0.97,1707.272,1729.394,"To be clear, a lot of the same inquiries that you just articulated and posed to Councilmember Strauss, I formally have written the questions to the executives to get the answers and once I do I certainly will relay them to the rest of the Council.",37,,
162,0.97,1729.394,1769.801,"I can just share Anecdotally from having gone to Ballard Commons park probably at the peak of the situation there, prior to the initial 17 offers of shelter that Councilmember Strauss eluded to earlier, I don't know that, I don't know that it would be that difficult for the executive to have made a determination of an extraordinary circumstance based on what I saw, but I do want to learn more about what that process is going to be like, how the determinations are going to be made and also how the Council and other stake holders will be informed when those decisions are made.",37,,
163,0.97,1769.801,1785.15,"Once I get that information, I will make sure that the Council is duly apprised of that and we can assess where to go from there.",37,,
164,0.97,1785.15,1797.328,And I have no questions around the ongoing concerns about the conditions of Ballard Commons Park for both those who are experiencing homelessness there and sort of the surrounding neighborhood.,38,,
165,0.97,1797.328,1800.565,I think the concerns are real and have been long standing.,38,,
166,0.97,1800.565,1809.574,I'm not--my comments aren't designed to sort of negate the reality of what the environment looks like at Ballard Commons park.,38,,
167,0.97,1809.574,1811.676,I'm very familiar with what it looks like.,38,,
168,0.97,1811.676,1817.148,"I get--I understand it, I see it.",38,,
169,0.97,1817.148,1852.35,"My bigger concern is that if the human services Department is making a commitment to, quote, continue to remove waste, garbage, and debris from unmanaged encampment to reduce public health risk, was that not done to the level it should have been in order to avoid disruption and spreading of this encampment during the Covid-19 pandemic, which is, you know, an even more extreme circumstance than in a Nonpandemic setting.",38,,
170,0.97,1852.35,1880.878,That is my concern is did Hsd and others fulfill their obligation to do sort of that hygiene work at the level that they needed to be doing it as they saw the conditions evolving in a way that we can say was done in good faith to avoid the necessity and the need to post the notice that they just posted.,38,,
171,0.97,1880.878,1884.482,Appreciate that.,39,,
172,0.97,1884.482,1885.183,Thank you.,39,,
173,0.97,1885.183,1885.75,Councilmember Herbold?,40,,
174,0.97,1885.75,1886.15,Super quick.,41,,
175,0.97,1886.15,1891.656,"As mentioned, I was bounced off the caller, I bounced myself off the call.",41,,
176,0.97,1891.656,1926.057,"I also want to add that the CDC has issued guidance about this particular topic of how local government should be handling Unsanctioned encampment and the CDC guidance is that Encampments should not be moved during the Coronavirus crisis to keep everyone healthy so it is not just our own Department's policy that we're asking about whether or not there is fidelity and adherence to, it is the CDC guidance that I think it is important to center our inquiry on.",41,,
177,0.97,1926.057,1967.031,"That is a great point and again, I think that--I think it is important for the general public and in particular for constituents in district 6 to hear from us that we--this isn't an issue of us not understanding what the conditions are at Ballard Commons park it is a matter of figuring out what are the best rules to implement during the Covid-19 crisis to make sure that we are not exacerbating those public health conditions by virtue of engaging in the removal, when the CDC and our own Hsd Department is saying we're going to put a pause on these.",42,,
178,0.97,1967.031,1980.011,"We need to really address the dangers of Coronavirus that may exist at those particular sites, so I appreciate that fine point.",42,,
179,0.97,1980.011,1988.286,I have gotten a flag that Councilmember Morales has a question.,42,,
180,0.97,1988.286,1988.853,The floor is yours.,42,,
181,0.97,1988.853,1995.226,I couldn't see you raise your hand so I want to call on you now to ask your question.,42,,
182,0.97,1995.226,1995.46,Please?,42,,
183,0.97,1995.46,2002.667,"Thank you, Yeah, we were having some technical difficulties this morning as well.",43,,
184,0.97,2002.667,2043.374,"So I want to thank Councilmember Strauss for doing his best to deal with this situation, you know, I think we have all been struggling for quite a long time to figure out how to--with the fact that encampment Removals are not as long-term solutions to dealing with this crisis with the homelessness crisis and with the after effects, where the folks who are actually being moved, as Councilmember Herbold said, the CDC weeks ago issued their statement saying this is not a good strategy, that it actually increases exposure, the risk of exposure for people.",43,,
185,0.97,2043.374,2052.383,I think the challenge with the Mayor's policy is that it isn't enforceable.,43,,
186,0.97,2052.383,2079.377,It is an administrative decision and that is why our office has been working on legislation to really try to deal with how these encampment Removals occur and be predictive on what constitutes an extreme risk and a real legitimate reason for why folks may be moved.,43,,
187,0.97,2079.377,2101.899,"We're hoping to have that legislation ready soon so that we can actually make a permanent policy, what the Mayor has proposed through her administrative process and my hope is that we'll have something in the next week or so that we can move forward.",43,,
188,0.97,2101.899,2102.2,Thank you.,43,,
189,0.97,2102.2,2102.633,Okay.,44,,
190,0.97,2102.633,2122.954,Any other questions or comments for Councilmember Strauss from either those on the phone or those on Video?,44,,
191,0.97,2122.954,2127.291,"Okay, so hearing nothing.",44,,
192,0.97,2127.291,2128.759,Council President?,45,,
193,0.97,2128.759,2129.093,Yes.,46,,
194,0.97,2129.093,2129.627,Councilmember Mosqueda?,47,,
195,0.97,2129.627,2129.861,Yes.,48,,
196,0.97,2129.861,2136.134,We often measure whether or not somebody has been referred to shelter services.,49,,
197,0.97,2136.134,2151.616,Do we have any confirmation on how many individuals actually were admitted into shelter services and whether or not we know what happened to the rest of those?,49,,
198,0.97,2151.616,2157.355,Council Strauss raised his hand first and then Councilmember Lewis.,50,,
199,0.97,2157.355,2158.823,"Thank you, Councilmember Mosqueda.",51,,
200,0.97,2158.823,2163.027,Data I have is data from last Wednesday.,51,,
201,0.97,2163.027,2174.505,"Navigation was out there referring people into shelter as of last Wednesday, 17 people had been placed in shelter alternative Lake front and South Lake Union.",51,,
202,0.97,2174.505,2180.244,I do not have updated information since that time.,51,,
203,0.97,2180.244,2182.079,"Councilmember Lewis, anything to add?",52,,
204,0.97,2182.079,2191.122,"I was just add, Councilmember Mosqueda, that my understanding is that, like the removal itself is occurring pretty much, like, right now.",53,,
205,0.97,2191.122,2193.157,It started at 9:00 A.M.,53,,
206,0.97,2193.157,2207.438,"This morning, so the final data and information on that should be available, I would imagine, early this week, and that is another one of my inquiries that I have sent along to the executives.",53,,
207,0.97,2207.438,2213.21,"Once I get that information, I'll relay it out.",53,,
208,0.97,2213.21,2214.178,Great.,54,,
209,0.97,2214.178,2219.617,"Thank you for that, Councilmember Lewis, Strauss, and Mosqueda, for that additional information.",54,,
210,0.97,2219.617,2224.722,Any other questions or comments before we move forward?,54,,
211,0.97,2224.722,2225.556,Okay.,54,,
212,0.97,2225.556,2231.395,"It looks like we are ready to continue through Councilmember reports, so next up is Councilmember Herbold.",54,,
213,0.97,2231.395,2233.097,"Please, the floor is yours.",54,,
214,0.97,2233.097,2234.665,Thank you.,55,,
215,0.97,2234.665,2244.675,"The public safety and human services committee has no items on the full council agenda today, nor is the committee meeting.",55,,
216,0.97,2244.675,2255.72,There are three bills that I have sponsoring and I know Councilmember Juarez will have additional information to share because she is also Co-Sponsoring the bills.,55,,
217,0.97,2255.72,2267.031,The bills on the full council agenda today that I'm sponsoring are 119780.,55,,
218,0.97,2267.031,2269.867,119781 and 119782.,55,,
219,0.97,2269.867,2279.644,"Those three bills are related to the work associated with fire station 31, a replacement for fire station 31.",55,,
220,0.97,2279.644,2280.711,"Again, there are three bills.",55,,
221,0.97,2280.711,2293.758,The first bill authorizes a lease for the temporary location of fire station 31 to a parking lot across the street at epic life church.,55,,
222,0.97,2293.758,2314.945,"The second bill authorizes FAS to purchase property for the permanent relocation of fire station 31, and the third bill does a number of things, a limited tax tax general obligation Fund and a loan to place into the fund.",55,,
223,0.97,2314.945,2318.282,The Interfund loan is $8.1 million.,55,,
224,0.97,2318.282,2332.163,It is a loan from the construction and instructions Fund and will be paid back at a later date by an Ltgo bond.,55,,
225,0.97,2332.163,2360.991,"Those, again, those three bills are considered necessary in routine and Councilmember Juarez will be talking about them shortly and sharing some support that we have received from local 27 and specifically related to the crisis necessity associated with the conditions at fire station 31.",55,,
226,0.97,2360.991,2370.768,"Oher items that came up last week for me, I chaired the watershed resource inventory area 9 meeting.",55,,
227,0.97,2370.768,2390.287,"I recently have become a Co-Chair of that regional Committee, and then I also held my virtual office hours last Wednesday and took virtual meetings with constituents from 2:00 to 6:00.",55,,

229,0.97,2399.63,2414.178,Really happy to announce that the West Seattle farmer's market reopened last week using social distancing protocols that were negotiated and agreed upon with King County public health and the Mayor's office.,55,,
230,0.97,2414.178,2417.581,"Nearly 1,000 people attended the Sunday farmer's market.",55,,
231,0.97,2417.581,2447.978,"Also, last week, participated with Councilmember Pedersen on the client meeting with the Seattle Department of transportation about the West Seattle bridge and then also, late last week, I sent a letter to Washington state asking they consider directing some of the traffic between South worth to downtown Seattle and consider trips from Fount La Roy to downtown.",55,,
232,0.97,2447.978,2470.201,I recognize that accommodating this request would not be simple given the shortage of slippage space at the dock but given that the bridge may not reopen it is important to consider options that have not been deemed feasible before.,55,,
233,0.97,2470.201,2488.052,"We know that during previous years in 1981, 1993, and 2002, Eastbound ferry traffic was diverted to downtown instead of going to Laroy on a temporary basis.",55,,
234,0.97,2488.052,2518.048,"There will be probably over the next couple of weeks, a series of requests to various jurisdictions who have the ability to help West Seattleites in identifying new transit needs to help mitigate the impacts of having the bridge closed and you'll be hearing more from me on my efforts there.",55,,
235,0.97,2518.048,2519.116,So thank you.,55,,

258,0.97,2658.055,2663.494,I want to thank the superintendent for that.,58,,
259,0.97,2663.494,2668.899,I'm not the chair of transportation but Mr. Pedersen can work with that.,58,,

285,0.97,2846.71,2858.422,The reason why this is important is because we have been talking to them and assisting with us and working with parks to talk about how we have more safe streets and they presented some plans to us and I'm guessing that they have met.,58,,
286,0.97,2858.422,2863.794,My understanding is they have met with some of my colleagues as well.,58,,
287,0.97,2863.794,2876.84,Basically talking about the three strategies or about how we can start reducing dangerous crowding on the sidewalks and parks.,58,,
288,0.97,2876.84,2894.691,"Adaptation to talk about sidewalk expansions, a lot of businesses want S-Dot to lift restrictions so they can start putting small tables outside, having a better way to be able to serve pick up food outside, they have Car-Free recreational route that reduces speeding.",58,,
289,0.97,2894.691,2919.683,"It has been great meeting with them and getting their ideas and sitting down or talking to--not sitting down, but talking to the superintendent about how we can incorporate some of the ideas now that we know we'll be sheltering in place in all of May and weather is getting better, more than ever we have to open up more space so people can get out and move around, particularly the children not in school.",58,,
290,0.97,2919.683,2932.195,"So one of the things that we looked at is we looked at Oakland, California, including the nation with 74 miles of open streets.",58,,
291,0.97,2932.195,2936.967,"You know, we would like to strive for more open streets and working with parks with that.",58,,

293,0.97,2949.913,2958.956,"Again, S-Dot, along with parks, is collecting data on user streets and satisfaction.",58,,
294,0.97,2958.956,2972.636,"I'm happy to say, though I didn't get a chance to walk through there, two blocks away we have a street closed in my neighborhood, a safe street, and wonderful to see a lot of families out there this weekend.",58,,
295,0.97,2972.636,2982.679,"Runners, people with their Strollers walking, I did not know there were so many dogs and children in my neighborhood.",58,,

297,0.97,2983.08,3002.666,"I think that is it, except for the fire station, and I want to thank Councilmember Herbold, thank you so much for staying on top of this and on a side note, I know this has all been difficult for all of us, trying to do our jobs from home, but I think we're doing a good job.",58,,

420,0.97,4075.037,4102.398,"Our desire is to engage in a conversation over the next few days here with the office and Hsd to talk about the pressing issues that we see from homeless service providers as the Desc and E-mail to the city last Friday, the Covid related crisis is coming into focus now since we have had two months of experience taking action to prevent the spread of the virus among our clients and the broader community.",69,,
421,0.97,4102.398,4119.482,"He goes on to talk about the issues around meal delivery, needing to put individuals who are currently in shelter into individual rooms, the cost of hotel rooms potentially and the cost of staffing to make sure those services are ongoing for individuals and meals can be delivered.",69,,
422,0.97,4119.482,4161.79,"I think that in the next few days, I'm optimistic that we will be able to engage in a robust conversation with Hsd, with the office of housing, with the office and most importantly the folks on the front line providing services to those in shelters and talk about the need for us to quickly allocate existing funds out the door to De-Densefy the remaining individuals who need individual rooms, to ensure that there is sufficient support for food assistance to those living in various places, meal delivery to support the housing and to those that are the most vulnerable and ensure there is sufficient funding for staff.",69,,
423,0.97,4161.79,4194.823,"So with the support and I think agreement from the executive, our amendment would hold back 1.4 million of the Cbdg funds allocated in this round of the cares act to ensure there is engagement with the homeless service providers, to understand what the funding needs are that they have for Covid response and identify the sources to meet the needs and with that, perhaps I will pause to allow for Amy Gore to walk through any of the amendment details if that is desired since it came in this morning at 10:00 A.M.",69,,
424,0.97,4194.823,4199.361,And I'll close with close comments which they are to build today.,69,,
425,0.97,4199.361,4200.362,"Thank you, Councilmember Mosqueda.",70,,
426,0.97,4200.362,4216.378,"I'll go ahead and ask Amy on the line to walk us through the amendments and take, perhaps, some questions from Councilmembers about the amendment or the substance of the bill.",70,,
427,0.97,4216.378,4216.946,"Miss Gore, please?",70,,
428,0.97,4216.946,4222.918,"Thank you, Councilmember, can you hear me okay?",71,,
429,0.97,4222.918,4224.053,We can.,72,,
430,0.97,4224.053,4224.453,Fantastic.,73,,
431,0.97,4224.453,4234.863,"So as Councilmember Mosqueda mentioned, I sent around a substitute Council bill 119783 about 20 minutes ago.",73,,
432,0.97,4234.863,4238.701,The substitute bill does three things.,73,,
433,0.97,4238.701,4247.109,"First, it adds food support for unsheltered persons to the uses of funds for the emergency service grant moneys that we are accepting and appropriating.",73,,
434,0.97,4247.109,4261.156,"The second thing that it does is adds meal delivery to permanent supportive housing to uses of funds for the older Americans act grant, money that we are accepting.",73,,
435,0.97,4261.156,4276.772,The original bill just talks about meal delivery to individuals that are participating in the congregate meal programs but doesn't discuss the potential of those deliveries going to individuals who might be home bound in permanent support housing.,73,,
436,0.97,4276.772,4285.547,It changes the use of the funds a little bit to allow for that action.,73,,
437,0.97,4285.547,4297.526,The major change that the substitute bill does is change the funding allocations for the CDBG funds.,73,,
438,0.97,4297.526,4316.311,It ACCEPTS all 5.6 million of the CDBG funds but takes 1.4 million of those funds and does not appropriate them and then Redistricted the appropriation for the remaining activities that are funded through CDBG.,73,,
439,0.97,4316.311,4327.056,"That would Westbound a reduction and homelessness prevention from the proposed 1.5 million in appropriations to approximately $705,000.",73,,
440,0.97,4327.056,4336.465,It would reduce rental assistance that is going to the home base program that is being administered by United way.,73,,
441,0.97,4336.465,4343.238,"It would reduce that appropriation from 1.5 million to $705,000.",73,,
442,0.97,4343.238,4357.186,"It would increase the building stability Fund, which is the rental assistance that will go to the office of housing, affordable housing portfolio to cover lost rent.",73,,
443,0.97,4357.186,4363.158,It would change from 1.1 million to 1.4 million.,73,,
444,0.97,4363.158,4373.068,"And then Finally, the small business stabilization fund would be reduced slightly from 1.5 million to 1.4 million.",73,,
445,0.97,4373.068,4389.952,"The 1.4 million that is not appropriated, the idea is that after the discussions that Councilmember Mosqueda mentioned, that Council would appropriate the 1.4 million in future action.",73,,
446,0.97,4389.952,4395.257,"Thank you so much, Aimle.",74,,
447,0.97,4395.257,4400.362,"If Amy, if I may summarize some points on this.",74,,
448,0.97,4400.362,4407.069,Can I open it up for questions really quickly and then you can sort of clean up if you need to.,75,,
449,0.97,4407.069,4413.776,"Councilmember Herbold, I saw you raise your hand, please.",75,,
450,0.97,4413.776,4414.743,You're on mute.,75,,
451,0.97,4414.743,4429.992,"First off, I want to thank Councilmember Mosqueda and central staffer Amy Gore for fulfilling one of the things I was trying to figure out how to do but was unable to figure out how to do.",76,,
452,0.97,4429.992,4438.901,And that is namely to fund some meal delivery to supportive housing projects.,76,,
453,0.97,4438.901,4447.576,We had been looking at the Esg source and found that that was not an allowed source of funds for the purpose.,76,,
454,0.97,4447.576,4454.216,So glad you were able to figure out how to do that.,76,,
455,0.97,4454.216,4467.329,"To the decision on holding off on appropriating some of the funds, the CDBG funds, I have some concerns, particularly the reduction in rent assistance.",76,,
456,0.97,4467.329,4504.566,"We know that the funded home base program took 7,000 applications a couple of weeks ago and they're only anticipating being able to fund about 2,000 households out of 7,000 people who applied in a 48-Hour period, and I believe that was based on the anticipation of the allocation of Cbdb funds to add to the home base program.",76,,
457,0.97,4504.566,4535.797,"I appreciate that the intent is not to never appropriate them, but to have a conversation about whether or not it is the best appropriation of them, but I am concerned, because I feel like we have already ear marked--we haven't gone through the legislative process, but through an application process for home base, we have a sense of how great the need is for these funds.",76,,
458,0.97,4535.797,4548.443,I'm concerned about delaying the availability of these funds while we have another conversation about whether or not it is the best use of the funds.,76,,
459,0.97,4548.443,4549.244,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",77,,
460,0.97,4549.244,4557.886,I'm trying to figure out who would be the most appropriate to answer the question.,77,,
461,0.97,4557.886,4561.29,"Councilmember Mosqueda, do you have additional information or do you want Amy to?",77,,
462,0.97,4561.29,4567.796,"I'm happy to and then, Amy, if you have anything else to add, that would be helpful, too.",78,,
463,0.97,4567.796,4569.564,Thank you for Articulating that.,78,,
464,0.97,4569.564,4591.787,"As you said, there is pressing need from everything from food assistance to rental assistance, small business assistance and as we're hearing from the front line care providers for those who are trying to De-Densefy the shelter services, the ongoing need for folks to get moved into individual rooms and trying to strike the balance is exactly the concern that we came up.",78,,
465,0.97,4591.787,4608.036,"In talking to some folks who were working on trying to get people into individual rooms and the meal delivery services, I raised the concern about rental assistance and being a big priority for us with the entire Council.",78,,
466,0.97,4608.036,4616.411,One of the things that we think is important is not saying it won't be used.,78,,
467,0.97,4616.411,4646.942,"We'll be allocating the dollars as we see the 13 million going out from the state dollars and ongoing conversations on how to Reallocte the funds, we have heard that there is possibly funding at Hsd already to be funding a De-Densification strategies within the shelters.",78,,
468,0.97,4646.942,4652.981,It was suggested we hold back the 1.4.,78,,
469,0.97,4652.981,4659.388,"Don't allocate is specifically to Dedensification, which is my desire.",78,,
470,0.97,4659.388,4669.364,"Knowing there are Eviction protections and rental protections in place and B, there is ongoing funds and to move forward with any additional rental assistance we can get out the door.",78,,
471,0.97,4669.364,4679.207,"Ideally on Monday, but to know that we do have the 1.4 just in case things don't coming together over the next two days here to ensure that there is De-Densification.",78,,
472,0.97,4679.207,4692.621,"The real important issue, and I know the executives office is aware of this as we talk to the county partners, is the desire to make sure that we identify the funding that is needed and if we need the 1.4, I think we all would have a conversation about where that should probably go.",78,,
473,0.97,4692.621,4731.426,"My desire would be that the 1.4 ultimately go back into rental assistance as we have talked about here, knowing it is one small piece of a larger pie, but when we look at the folks that are in shelters still, we know we have about 500 individuals that need to get into the individual rooms, we have a need for ongoing meal assistance and personnel support, and when I hear that there is potentially funding already existing at Hsd, I think that is really positive and would want to work with the executive to release that 1.4 quickly, but I think they and we have a shared desire that we get the rental assistance dollars out the door as soon as possible.",78,,
474,0.97,4731.426,4740.502,"We also want assurances if there is not that funding or the conversation doesn't materialize, that we help move people out of the congregate shelter settings as quickly as possible.",78,,
475,0.97,4740.502,4748.343,One report that I heard late last week as we were waiting for some of the questions to be answered that we submitted on Monday was that we're about two weeks away.,78,,
476,0.97,4748.343,4755.484,We're two weeks behind in seeing some of the data points that we have seen from long-term care facilities already.,78,,
477,0.97,4755.484,4784.479,"If individuals don't get moved into individual beds or individual rooms, we're getting to a crisis point where people start contracting Covid-19 at a higher rate and I want on applaud the human service provider organizations on the front line that kept the numbers relatively low, but we also recognize that the folks that are in shelters still, having them six feet apart in beds and assuming people will stay six feet apart and not contract Covid at some point in the day is not working out.",78,,
478,0.97,4784.479,4796.091,We're playing with a little bit of a fire here as we think about how we get folks as quickly as possible into that individual room setting and away from congregate shelters.,78,,
479,0.97,4796.091,4810.005,You have my commitment that it is a concern shared by other Council colleagues that we get as much funding out in rental assistance as possible and we do it with urgency.,78,,
480,0.97,4810.005,4810.438,Great.,79,,
481,0.97,4810.438,4826.188,I know that we also have Tracy Ratcliffe and Jeff Simmons on the line related to this particular bill so wanted to certainly give them an opportunity to add anything that they think is important to this conversation at this point.,79,,
482,0.97,4826.188,4827.155,Just for clarification.,80,,
483,0.97,4827.155,4836.598,United way does have a million dollars of funding that we provided and we did that through reallocation for the future housing levy.,80,,
484,0.97,4836.598,4843.672,They have a million dollars that they're using meet the needs of city residents that have applied so far.,80,,
485,0.97,4843.672,4850.545,"Obviously the legislation is supposed to provide another $700,000 in the short-term to allow them to continue to meet the need.",80,,
486,0.97,4850.545,4852.614,Just so you all know that.,80,,
487,0.97,4852.614,4853.582,Great.,81,,
488,0.97,4853.582,4857.619,"Chef, anything you would like to add?",81,,
489,0.97,4857.619,4859.154,Not at this time.,82,,
490,0.97,4859.154,4860.021,Okay.,83,,
491,0.97,4860.021,4917.479,"So I think Councilmember Mosqueda, I want to appreciate the work that you have done with the executive to get more information and sort of zero in on this particular appropriation need and I think what you're hearing from Councilmember Herbold, which I think you agree with and are also aligned with, which is that we don't want to create any sort of undo delay or delay certainly that would result in negative consequences to the people who are relying on the services through the funding of the city of Seattle and I am hearing you say that that is not the goal and that really, we need to see some motivation on behalf of the executive to go ahead and advance the conversation in due haste to come up with a clear solution to get these dollars out the door.",83,,
492,0.97,4917.479,4932.294,My hope is that that will be able to be accomplished and that we'll see a good proposal for appropriation for the dollars come through quickly.,83,,
493,0.97,4932.294,4943.271,I just wanted to hear from you Councilmember Mosqueda to hear your thinking on how quickly you think the turn around on this could be or hope it would be.,83,,
494,0.97,4943.271,4944.439,"Thank you, Council President.",84,,
495,0.97,4944.439,4949.377,My hope is that we will have clarification by the end of this week.,84,,
496,0.97,4949.377,4954.449,I know that the office is committed to engaging with service providers this week.,84,,
497,0.97,4954.449,4980.175,"It was Friday when folks began to receive a number of comments about the reality on the ground as it relates to those who are trying to provide services that are still in shelters and as the reality is shared and people realize the tight constraints people have, you know, potentially not being able to operate within the next month, I know that that is a real concern for the city at large.",84,,
498,0.97,4980.175,4988.316,"I believe that within the next, a few days, we should be able to have the ongoing conversations and hopefully report back on Monday the conversations we have heard.",84,,
499,0.97,4988.316,5012.741,"Again, if the Council is satisfied with the outcomes of the engagement with the service providers and the funding identified for a decent De-Densification I think we can quickly on the 1.4 million allocation and release it appropriately as we all desire.",84,,
500,0.97,5012.741,5022.584,"I want to thank folks, this would be a compliment to the hotel services and De-Densification services that the county is running which are focused on isolation and quarantine or Inq.",84,,
501,0.97,5022.584,5030.191,"We want to make sure that the beds are saved for those who may be experiencing Covid, showing symptoms, are contagious themselves.",84,,
502,0.97,5030.191,5041.836,That is different from the effort to try to really be preventive and to get some of those individuals who are still in congregate settings into individual rooms.,84,,
503,0.97,5041.836,5055.316,"When we spend money, if we're able to get folks into individual rooms, a lot of the funding, the three quarters are reimbursed later, identifying other sources is a fine conversation to engage in.",84,,
504,0.97,5055.316,5055.75,I appreciate that.,84,,
505,0.97,5055.75,5063.191,We want to be smart with the dollars and use as much opportunity as we can to get reimbursement from the Feds.,84,,
506,0.97,5063.191,5068.696,My hope is we'll be able to come back to you next week and talk about the release of the 1.4.,84,,
507,0.97,5068.696,5073.301,Feeling pretty optimistic at this point in the morning but I know there is a pressing need.,84,,
508,0.97,5073.301,5078.606,We'll keep you all updated.,84,,
509,0.97,5078.606,5079.24,Thank you.,85,,
510,0.97,5079.24,5083.044,"Councilmember Herbold, you had another question?",86,,
511,0.97,5083.044,5083.912,I do.,87,,
512,0.97,5083.912,5103.598,I really support the under lying goals as expressed by Councilmember Mosqueda to use city,87,,
513,0.97,5103.832,5131.759,"Similar to the other issue that I raised earlier, I was going down a little bit with the rabbit hole and how to have those conversations about the need to shift our De- Densification approach away from the intensifying for shelters into other congregate care settings but instead from shelters into hotel rooms.",88,,
514,0.97,5131.759,5168.93,"And I had been thinking about Reallocating some of the funds specifically I was interested in Reallocating the funds for the councils homes for good program because the executive was, is proposing in this bill to back out the general fund dollars that the Council provided and instead use the Federal relief dollars as a way of making the program funding more sustainable.",88,,
515,0.97,5168.93,5194.556,"I was thinking, well, we funded that program, let's hear $750 for the intensification program focused on providing hotel rooms but the thing I am struggling with is I don't see, we could earmark money but if the executive doesn't want to spend them that way I don't see a willingness on the part of the executive to buy hotel rooms for this purpose.",88,,
516,0.97,5194.556,5198.76,Every time we have asked they have said that's what the county is doing.,88,,
517,0.97,5198.76,5212.574,"So, have you in your conversations with the executive heard a willingness to start buying hotel rooms for this very important purpose?",88,,
518,0.97,5212.574,5218.446,You are exactly Articulating the concerns I have as well.,89,,
519,0.97,5218.446,5238.9,"I think the understanding of why these hotel rooms is evolving for the executive, I think there is a difference between what they believe to be open rooms available from the King County program and defining those King County rooms as high IQ is very important.",89,,
520,0.97,5238.9,5245.106,We need isolation and quarantine rooms but it's very different from what you and I are talking about with a more Preventative strategy.,89,,
521,0.97,5245.106,5267.428,"I will say I think they are aware of the concerns now more than ever, especially because of the ongoing conversations we've had over the last four days about intent to put forward, I think the service providers, specifically others who have been weighing in since Friday have provided a more robust picture of the reality on the ground.",89,,
522,0.97,5267.428,5284.345,I am hoping that means between now and the next few days with Hst and executive's office being involved and conversations with people who paint this picture for us we will see a movement toward purchasing rooms.,89,,
523,0.97,5284.345,5288.149,On a short-term basis.,89,,
524,0.97,5288.149,5292.02,"Yes, it is resource intense as have been described in ""the Seattle times"" but it also helps save lives.",89,,
525,0.97,5292.02,5298.126,I think that is the biggest thing that people are really concerned with right now.,89,,
526,0.97,5298.126,5310.471,"If in the next 3 to 4 weeks we can allocate additional funds that Ideally will be three quarters reimbursed by the Feds, and we save lives, that would be a Win-Win.",89,,
527,0.97,5310.471,5325.987,"My hope is that between you and me and I would like to involve others on the councils well, we continue to sort of underscore and make the push for these dollars to be used exactly as you just described.",89,,
528,0.97,5325.987,5359.087,"I would say this probably more of an understanding of what the need is now, given the providers weighing in and last for days and that is exactly why we want to bring forward the amendment and at this point hold back the 1.4 so those conversations are ongoing and we have assurance that they don't come to fruition we have 1.4 as a down payment but you're right, it's a tough decision but these issues I think in the last few days have really painted a new stark reality for our friends in terms of where the allocations should go.",89,,
529,0.97,5359.087,5360.221,Thank you.,90,,
530,0.97,5360.221,5366.327,Any other questions or comments on the presentation?,90,,
531,0.97,5366.327,5375.903,We have counsel central staff with us so any other questions for them or concerns on this particular bill?,90,,
532,0.97,5375.903,5383.444,"I don't hear any, thank you.",90,,
533,0.97,5383.444,5386.914,Thank you for your work on the background leading up to this.,90,,
534,0.97,5386.914,5399.66,"Seeing there are no more questions or comments about this bill if you are free, go about the rest of your work for the day and I want to thank you again for taking the time to call in this morning.",90,,
535,0.97,5399.66,5401.929,I appreciate it and all of the work you are doing.,90,,
536,0.97,5401.929,5406.367,Anything else on your report or can we continue?,90,,
537,0.97,5406.367,5411.873,"We can continue, thank you very much.",91,,
538,0.97,5411.873,5415.943,"I want to echo the appreciation for central staff, especially Amy Gore, thank you for her work over the weekend.",91,,
539,0.97,5415.943,5416.944,Thank you.,92,,
540,0.97,5416.944,5417.979,"Okay, we will move on through.",92,,
541,0.97,5417.979,5423.885,We are close to being done.,92,,
542,0.97,5423.885,5425.253,"Council member Pedersen, the floor is yours.",92,,
543,0.97,5425.253,5426.087,"Good morning, colleagues.",93,,
544,0.97,5426.087,5437.865,"On this afternoon, full city council agenda, there are no items . In addition our Committee for transportation, utilities is canceled for this week.",93,,
545,0.97,5437.865,5451.279,This past Wednesday I joined a conference call with nearly 20 district 4 community Council leaders representing neighborhoods in district 4.,93,,
546,0.97,5451.279,5485.279,"Priorities they discussed included crime prevention, pedestrian safety, public input on real estate projects, Covid- 19 pandemic, homelessness, the new district improvement area, city budget, bus service, concerns about up zones, concerns about displacement, economic displacement, normally our office is like many offices, will attend community Council meetings each month with social distancing requirements necessitated this conference call.",93,,
547,0.97,5485.279,5491.319,It was great to not only hear from them but also able to hear each other's concerns.,93,,
548,0.97,5491.319,5497.158,This is great to support each other across communities.,93,,
549,0.97,5497.158,5512.24,"We will continue to have our virtual office hours every week with individual constituents who would like to reach out, they can sign up on the Council Website.",93,,
550,0.97,5512.24,5519.28,I do have some amendments and I will organize how we discuss that this morning.,93,,
551,0.97,5519.28,5520.147,Thank you.,93,,
552,0.97,5520.147,5529.49,"Thank you, any comments or questions for Councilmember Pedersen on his report?",94,,
553,0.97,5529.49,5529.891,All right.,94,,
554,0.97,5529.891,5534.562,Hearing none we will go ahead and move to the final report which is mine.,94,,
555,0.97,5534.562,5547.174,"So, I will answer going through that, we have someone on the line who will be walking us through the counsel bill I have on the agenda.",94,,
556,0.97,5547.174,5558.119,"The Governance and education committee that is regularly scheduled for May 2020 is canceled consistent with the stay home, stay healthy order.",94,,
557,0.97,5558.119,5563.424,I have two items on the agenda this estimate the first is on the introduction and refer Colander.,94,,
558,0.97,5563.424,5569.83,Counsel bill 119762 is now reintroduced as bill 119 788.,94,,
559,0.97,5569.83,5574.168,To reflect the bill title changed my rental payment plan bill.,94,,
560,0.97,5574.168,5580.708,"It is my hope that the full council will take final action on this Re-Introduced bill next Monday, 11.",94,,
561,0.97,5580.708,5589.817,I to alert you that we had to do a reintroduction of the bill for a bill title change.,94,,
562,0.97,5589.817,5594.822,After cross walking it with the governor's proclamation.,94,,
563,0.97,5594.822,5604.832,"So the second item is Kosovo 119 784 and again, we have counsel central staff coming with us today to walk us through this substitute bill.",94,,
564,0.97,5604.832,5609.337,And she will be available to answer questions regarding the various amendments.,94,,
565,0.97,5609.337,5613.574,Before I handed over I want to share a few things about this bill.,94,,
566,0.97,5613.574,5620.247,On March 3 the Mayor declared a civil emergency in Responseto the pandemic.,94,,
567,0.97,5620.247,5621.082,Covid-19.,94,,
568,0.97,5621.082,5629.79,By March 14 she had declared a moratorium on residential Evictions.,94,,
569,0.97,5629.79,5632.093,Governor Inslee declared a similar moratorium on Evictions on March 18.,94,,
570,0.97,5632.093,5659.487,Both Eviction orders were extended now to June 4. in those early weeks in March it became clear that this crisis would have a widespread lasting impact and so my office began the work and identified two areas of protection that the Council could enact now to help people stay in their homes throughout this pandemic and in the aftermath of the pandemic.,94,,
571,0.97,5659.487,5678.906,"So, while neither of these bills prohibits nor puts a permanent moratorium on Evictions, both of the bills that I have introduced are intended to help tenants have more time and flexibility to ultimately stay housed as they get back to business.",94,,
572,0.97,5678.906,5693.721,Today we will consider counsel bill 119 784 which would create an additional defense for those in Eviction proceedings similar to the bills we had and Pre- existing just cause Eviction ordinance.,94,,
573,0.97,5693.721,5706.434,"I have some amendments for consideration today, one of which is pretty technical.",94,,
574,0.97,5706.434,5714.442,And before I sort of walk through those I will ask Asher to walk us through the substitute bill and then address the amendments and we will go ahead and take up some questions.,94,,
575,0.97,5714.442,5725.686,"I want to thank you for we do that, I want to thank Council member Herbold who as we know has been a tireless advocate on behalf of tenants for many, many years.",94,,
576,0.97,5725.686,5742.136,"And she has been just really helpful to me in thinking through how to craft this bill in a way and the other bill as well, in a way to make sure it has maximum protection for tenants will also balancing the needs of property owners in this context.",94,,
577,0.97,5742.136,5753.714,I want to thank her for all of her good thinking and partnership on many of the changes that are reflected in the substitute bill that will be before us now.,94,,
578,0.97,5753.714,5768.929,"So, I will handed over to Asha to have us walk through the changes in the counsel bill and the amendments and we will, we will address the amendments respectively.",94,,
579,0.97,5768.929,5772.633,Good morning.,95,,
580,0.97,5772.633,5773.601,Good morning.,96,,
581,0.97,5773.601,5779.74,As a Council President described this as a substitute bill for 119 762 and it does a couple things.,97,,
582,0.97,5779.74,5788.115,"The changes between this bill and the previous bill are four major things, the change.",97,,
583,0.97,5788.115,5806.167,"The first is we moved the when this would be available from, during and with its six months after the civil emergency two only kick in six months after the end of the Mayor's moratorium on residential Evictions.",97,,
584,0.97,5806.167,5826.053,"Specifically since that moratorium has now been extended, to match the Mayor's assuming there are more extensions, June 4, if there are additional extensions of the moratorium this defense will kick in after six months after this end.",97,,
585,0.97,5826.053,5827.054,"So, that's the first change.",97,,
586,0.97,5827.054,5833.794,"That is one of the items that required a title change, that is why we are using the substitute bill.",97,,
587,0.97,5833.794,5848.375,The second major change is that the original bill had required that the failure to pay rent be linked to a financial hardship related to the Covid-19 emergency.,97,,
588,0.97,5848.375,5859.787,This bill removes that piece of Causation and essentially says if you are required to vacate within the effective period of the bill you can use this defense.,97,,
589,0.97,5859.787,5871.932,The third major change is more of a technical correction in that the original bill had Referenced some ten-day pay or vacate notices as the basis of the Eviction action.,97,,
590,0.97,5871.932,5887.948,Due to some changes in the state Legislature that occurred in 2019 ten-day notices are no longer associated with failure to pay rent so all of those references have been corrected to refer to 14 day pay or vacate notices.,97,,
591,0.97,5887.948,5902.763,"And then, the last change is not necessarily a major one that there are several sections in the original bill that it asked the governor to in-state estate white Eviction moratorium which is now been done.",97,,
592,0.97,5902.763,5919.346,And that related to the effective an additional ordinance which was the Evictions bill but since introduction of this new bill that is no longer a concern because that bill has gone into effect.,97,,
593,0.97,5919.346,5920.281,Those of the major changes.,97,,
594,0.97,5920.281,5924.551,We also made several additions to the new bill.,97,,
595,0.97,5924.551,5941.001,The first is to require that any Eviction notice that goes out has to have specific information on it that lets tenants know about their rights in terms of their ability to raise this defense to Eviction.,97,,
596,0.97,5941.001,5956.617,If the notice does not properly contain that information it allows the permit of construction and inspection to let the landlord know that notice is not valid and they would have to reissue it going forward.,97,,
597,0.97,5956.617,5972.499,Secondly it includes attorneys fees signaling to the court that if left to their discretion that attorneys fees should not be awarded to landlords in this situation.,97,,
598,0.97,5972.499,5984.278,"The court has discretion about whether to award those are not so this bill doesn't require that there are, it makes it clear to the court that the preferences that those fees not be awarded.",97,,
599,0.97,5984.278,6003.53,"There are some updates, recitals and legislative findings, making some grammatical corrections and updating the bill in terms of when it was originally introduced to development so things like the expansion of the Eviction moratorium and extension of the governor stay home, stay healthy order.",97,,
600,0.97,6003.53,6016.643,It includes a clause just to cover in case provisions of the bill are struck in court.,97,,
601,0.97,6016.643,6018.212,The remaining provisions will still be in effect.,97,,
602,0.97,6018.212,6030.591,It also included some language about the court providing installment plans after the tenant was able to successfully assert defense.,97,,
603,0.97,6030.591,6039.5,But that we will talk about in relation to one of the amendments.,97,,
604,0.97,6039.5,6063.724,"So, the amendments, that you have for your consideration, the first one is sponsored by Council member Gonzalez as she mentioned, it is to make grammatical corrections, revise some references to dates and that we are Compliant with the governor's order on the open public meetings act.",97,,
605,0.97,6063.724,6072.132,The second is sponsored by Council member Pedersen and would carve out an exemption similarly.,97,,
606,0.97,6072.132,6091.752,"The third which is currently designated as 3K or three B, which is procedural in terms of whether the second amendment Úpasses or fails, requires that the tenant engage in good faith effort to exit rental assesses funds.",97,,
607,0.97,6091.752,6097.024,This could be something like the Homebase fund or something else.,97,,
608,0.97,6097.024,6106.967,And then proposed amendment 4 which was circulated on Friday would remove that installment plan edition that I just mentioned is in the bill.,97,,
609,0.97,6106.967,6110.571,That is sponsored by Council President Gonzalez.,97,,
610,0.97,6110.571,6117.277,And Leslie I'm working on finalizing one additional proposed amendment from Councilmember Pedersen.,97,,
611,0.97,6117.277,6120.581,About some reporting requirements.,97,,
612,0.97,6120.581,6137.598,They would ask Sda to report back on the use of this defense as well as the number of Evictions that are being filed in court during this time period.,97,,
613,0.97,6137.598,6141.702,"Thank you, Aisha, so much for that hesitation.",98,,
614,0.97,6141.702,6148.408,And for the amendment you circulated describing the bill as you just presented about.,98,,
615,0.97,6148.408,6150.811,Thank you for that.,98,,
616,0.97,6150.811,6178.238,"So, I am going to go ahead and just walk us through some of my amendments, and take any questions about those and then I know that Council member Pedersen has some amendments and I will let him describe his amendments and then I will happily share with you all, you will get my thoughts on those limits.",98,,
617,0.97,6178.238,6185.946,"As was described, amendment one is largely technical changes as she described those and I don't think those were controversial.",98,,
618,0.97,6185.946,6187.214,We will leave it at that.,98,,
619,0.97,6187.214,6229.59,"I also have a second amendment, amendment 4 on the agenda, this amendment is as described would remove the requirement to have court ordered payment plans in large part because we engaged with some of the lawyers who do representation in the Evictions defense area and they shared insights about how some clients particularly those who are most vulnerable and would need the greatest level of protection would really experience a negative impact as a result of this particular amendment.",98,,
620,0.97,6229.59,6237.764,We want to sort of let our payment plan bill stand on its own.,98,,
621,0.97,6237.764,6259.519,If a court SEES that they have access to different types of relief forthe tenant we want to allow the court to use whatever those beliefs might be including waving rent or pursuing some other type of relief on behalf of the tenant.,98,,
622,0.97,6259.519,6266.927,But we want to allow for that to occur independently in the court proceedings.,98,,
623,0.97,6266.927,6271.698,That is sort of the essence of that particular amendment.,98,,
624,0.97,6271.698,6280.04,I am happy to take any questions about my amendments in particular.,98,,
625,0.97,6280.04,6284.044,Any questions or comments on my amendments?,98,,
626,0.97,6284.044,6291.018,"Okay, hearing none I will handed over to Council member Pedersen who has a few amendments of his own.",98,,
627,0.97,6291.018,6291.652,Council member Pedersen.,98,,
628,0.97,6291.652,6292.619,Thank you Council President.,99,,
629,0.97,6292.619,6319.579,"Colleagues, I appreciate what Councilmember Gonzalez has done with this legislation and taking the extra time and care to work out the details and proposals and the city government to prevent Evictions and harm that comes with those, I'm proud join my counsel colleagues and the Mayor on the relief programs with more relief programs coming.",99,,
630,0.97,6319.579,6325.085,"Meeting with you, the C.A.R.E.S.",99,,
631,0.97,6325.085,6344.004,"Act, several million dollars in additional Eviction prevention and rental assistance and I want our compassionate policies also to be sustainable and constituents have contacted my office both in favor of the legislation and opposed to it.",99,,
632,0.97,6344.004,6394.554,"And to reconcile those opposing views I put forward these amendments which I believe will enable us to look at the data along the way and you have these amendments, they do not garner sufficient support today, I think it's important to these ideas, to discuss them, respectfully, I think it's really healthy that we are able to have this discussion, especially when we are restricted from having certain public meetings, having the public come in to the meetings, I want to hear these issues in the form of amendments so they are very specific, three amendments as Aisha said, I want to thank several staff for their work on these, it's very similar to what we did for the ban on winter Evictions.",99,,
633,0.97,6394.554,6402.529,"We exempted small landlords, these are landlords who own for fewer units.",99,,
634,0.97,6402.529,6426.887,"The second amendment on the good faith effort, this is to show that tenants are making a Good-Faith effort to try to access these rental assistance programs that we are providing for this purpose because the whole point is to prevent the Eviction and not just have it is only a defense later but to prevent it in the first place.",99,,
635,0.97,6426.887,6451.478,"We are amending this, we are revising this amendment, to add an additional pass for showing something similar to this which is to self certify or self declaration that the person is suffering financial hardship so that will make the amendment before you right now much more flexible for the tenants.",99,,
636,0.97,6451.478,6458.785,"That language will be certainly provided shortly, we are working on the final details this morning.",99,,
637,0.97,6458.785,6466.493,Allowing self certification like we are doing for the utility discount program.,99,,
638,0.97,6466.493,6489.182,"The other amendment is reporting requirement basically asking the executive to come back in a couple months in the middle of the six month period and report on the limitation, the ordinance, terrified as much detail as they had and is available so we are tracking and seeing the effect this is having.",99,,
639,0.97,6489.182,6494.721,"Those are the three amendments, I'm happy to answer any questions and ashes here, as well.",99,,
640,0.97,6494.721,6547.607,"Before I open up for questions I want to sort of Cue up my reaction to some of these . On amendment two, a small landlord exemption by exempting landlords with four or fewer properties from this bill, I am not supporting that amendment in large part because I believe given the severity of the crisis and the pandemic we know that all tenants, all people who are required to pay rent during the month may be suffering from financial hardship that makes it difficult for them to pay rent and so I think that is true regardless of the size of the complex.",100,,
641,0.97,6547.607,6548.808,And the size of the unit.,100,,
642,0.97,6548.808,6580.24,"And my goal here is to really make sure that this defense which is time captain nature is accessible to the greatest number of people possible, again, we are creating a Pathway for tenants to be able to argue in court that the reason they are unable to pay rent is because they have encountered financial economic hardship as a result of the economic crisis that we are currently experiencing.",100,,
643,0.97,6580.24,6592.652,I really want to make sure that as many tenants as possible are able to access that defense so Unfortunately I can't support amendment number 2 for those reasons.,100,,
644,0.97,6592.652,6617.477,"In terms of amendment three a and 3B, I have not yet seen the language as described by Councilmember Pedersen, I'm interested in a softening of that language and would not be opposed to an option for people to declare that they have suffered a financial hardship and therefore are unable to pay rent.",100,,
645,0.97,6617.477,6642.202,"We do check in with the tenant advocate specifically at the King County housing justice project who mentioned and told us today that in effect people will, tenants will, be making this argument about financial hardship in court if they access that defense.",100,,
646,0.97,6642.202,6655.015,"And so, there wasn't a strong opposition to Council member Pedersen's proposal to pursue that particular amendment.",100,,
647,0.97,6655.015,6664.124,"So, again, I have to see the link which of the amendment, I'm interested in seeing it.",100,,
648,0.97,6664.124,6737.864,"And looking forward to receiving that language before I take a final position on whether or not I can support the amendment around access to rental assistance as an alternative a certification of financial hardship that makes it difficult to pay rent . My concern about the rental assistance program is that not everybody is able to access rental assistance programs as defined by the Federal Government and by the state dollars, there are Swaths of categories of people who have been categorically excluded from benefiting from those types of programs that I want to make sure that we are not sort of tying ourselves to those Qualifiers and thereby having the result of walking out the same categories of people print early if Undocumented immigrants from Accessing this defense if they are unable to ever say that they been able, in good faith, try to get rental assistance, they are inherently not ever able to access rental assistance because those dollars and programs are unavailable to them.",100,,
649,0.97,6737.864,6746.406,I don't want to have the unintended consequence of them not being able to access this as a defense.,100,,
650,0.97,6746.406,6747.941,In the course of an Eviction proceeding.,100,,
651,0.97,6747.941,6762.222,So that is my underlying concern about the amendment as was introduced but I'm happy to take a look at any revisions that soften and create an alternative Pathway for folks to consider.,100,,
652,0.97,6762.222,6781.141,"On the amendment 5, we've been consistent in wanted to get data and evaluating the effectiveness of many of our policy choices and have no objection to having the executive Department that is responsible for enforcement and monitoring programs to create a report.",100,,
653,0.97,6781.141,6794.954,That is where my stand is on the limits as proposed I'm happy to open it up for questions and comments from my colleagues.,100,,
654,0.97,6794.954,6797.757,Any questions or comments?,100,,
655,0.97,6797.757,6799.626,All right.,100,,
656,0.97,6799.626,6800.894,I am hearing none.,100,,
657,0.97,6800.894,6820.947,"So, we will go ahead and look for the additional language from you, Councilmember Pedersen, looking forward to seeing it and we will continue to work with you between now and 2:00 when you finalize that particular language.",100,,
658,0.97,6820.947,6828.254,"One last thing, Collies, from me, is a exciting opportunity to sign up for a proclamation.",100,,
659,0.97,6828.254,6852.912,"So, this is, this week, the week of May 3, through May 9, municipal clerks week, the city clerk is the Charter public office that subscribes to professional code of conduct and oath of office which together with the city of Seattle serve as a and Ideation upon which the office stands.",100,,
660,0.97,6852.912,6879.639,This is an opportunity to recognize the tremendous work that all of our employees in the municipal clerks office do day in and day out to provide the very important services to the people of the city of Seattle and to each of us so many of us interface and interact with the city clerks office on a daily basis . They are invaluable to our operations.,100,,
661,0.97,6879.639,6893.052,And are critically important to making sure that the public has access to us and we are being held up humble to the public.,100,,
662,0.97,6893.052,6906.466,"I will move forward a proclamation, presenting a proclamation this afternoon to the city clerk staff in that draft of the proclamation has been circulated to all of you.",100,,
663,0.97,6906.466,6907.467,I think within the last hour.,100,,
664,0.97,6907.467,6916.976,"And consistent with past practices we will do a quick roll call for those of you who would like to sign, have your name added to the proclamation.",100,,
665,0.97,6916.976,6921.948,You can signify by saying aye.,100,,
666,0.97,6921.948,6924.984,Any questions about the proclamation before I go through the roll call?,100,,
667,0.97,6924.984,6926.786,Or have the clerk go through the roll call?,100,,
668,0.97,6926.786,6930.39,"All right, great.",100,,
669,0.97,6930.39,6938.765,"I want to say, give my comments to the city clerks.",101,,
670,0.97,6938.765,6945.071,I fear the service to be amazing and I appreciate them so much.,101,,
671,0.97,6945.071,6945.471,Thank you.,101,,
672,0.97,6945.471,6947.874,Thank you for staying that.,102,,
673,0.97,6947.874,6948.975,They do amazing work.,102,,
674,0.97,6948.975,6963.923,"Let's go ahead, clerks, if you can get your pencils ready will call the role on having Council members and their names to the proclamation that recognizes municipal clerk week.",102,,
