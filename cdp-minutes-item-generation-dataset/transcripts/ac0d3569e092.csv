17,0.97,120.92,126.059,My initial inclination had been to have the committee and the Department rely on the materials prepared by central staff.,1,,

49,0.97,282.382,284.05,I have helped people as they have cried.,3,,
50,0.97,284.05,287.887,I have helped pull purchase possessions through the mud.,3,,
51,0.97,287.887,292.859,I have transported people only to help them move again as a have to go to the same brutal process.,3,,
52,0.97,292.859,306.806,"I have seen Sweeps derail people's job searches, destroy hard-won security, disrupt support networks, interrupt medical treatment, these documents, cherished mementos, and desperately needed work tools.",3,,
53,0.97,306.806,313.713,But also those Harms pale beside the trauma I have seen being inflicted.,3,,
54,0.97,313.713,324.057,"I am very grateful for the increased scrutiny this committee has been giving to the navigation team, which has enabled you to begin to see what people living outside in their concerned neighborhoods have been saying all along.",3,,
55,0.97,324.057,328.661,The navigation team is failing to navigate anyone to shelter and services and help.,3,,
56,0.97,328.661,336.235,They are instead effectively Criminalizing poverty and causing trauma to people trying to survive in public spaces.,3,,
57,0.97,336.235,342.775,It is time and past time to stop funding this wasteful harmful program.,3,,
58,0.97,342.775,352.485,And focus instead on building deeply affordable housing and connecting people to services and resources where they are while they are trying to survive outside.,3,,
59,0.97,352.485,354.687,I've yet to talk anyone who wants to be living outside.,3,,

62,0.97,364.764,365.932,The Sweeps are not helping that happen.,3,,
63,0.97,365.932,369.769,"Now that you are beginning to see that, it would be inexcusable for you to allow this to continue.",3,,
64,0.97,369.769,381.614,"For it to continue to spend our scarce financial resources, causing trauma and disruption in the lives of our most vulnerable neighbors.",3,,

72,0.97,400.666,401.3,And formally homeless myself.,5,,
73,0.97,401.3,405.705,I have also done a lot of work on the ground in past years.,5,,
74,0.97,405.705,406.305,Surrounding Kimmitt Removals.,5,,
75,0.97,406.305,417.35,"Unfortunately, because of the accelerated NOTE notice Sweeps schedules, it has been difficult to do outreach to the community and really help neighbors.",5,,
76,0.97,417.35,426.025,"When there has been notice for Sweeps, it has been a very interesting process to watch over the past year.",5,,
77,0.97,426.025,431.063,I have been involved especially on some of the larger encampment Removals.,5,,
78,0.97,431.063,435.868,The Fremont sweep from last year as well as the has a resolve Kimmitt removal.,5,,
79,0.97,435.868,450.383,"Something that I noticed and something that was very straightforward was that these numbers of available shelter, that is what they are coming into a huge Kimmitt with.",5,,
80,0.97,450.383,456.055,They might come into an Kimmitt with 60 or 70 people living there and split it up into portable zones in order to fill the quota.,5,,
81,0.97,456.055,460.493,So they are not technically breaking the rules but they are operating around him.,5,,
82,0.97,460.493,464.23,That is incredibly problematic.,5,,
83,0.97,464.23,474.841,"So I would propose that now that we have a new counsel, that we move forward in a way that we are looking at what our policies are surrounding encampment Removals.",5,,
84,0.97,474.841,478.811,We haven't taken a look at that really since 2017.,5,,
85,0.97,478.811,484.717,I think it was a mistake for the review board to be dissolved at the end of 2018.,5,,
86,0.97,484.717,495.728,I think we should review starting that up again as well as he can the process of really looking into what is going on here in the an Kimmitt Removals.,5,,
87,0.97,495.728,498.497,I am more than happy to lend my experience to that.,5,,

92,0.97,509.709,510.71,I work for Lehigh.,7,,
93,0.97,510.71,513.546,We are alarmed at the high number of Sweeps.,7,,
94,0.97,513.546,524.156,"Very few successful shelter placements by the navigation team, especially given that 96% of these redeemed exempt from the 72 hour notice.",7,,
95,0.97,524.156,531.731,Only 24% of the contacts made were referred to shelter and only 6% actually showed up to shelter.,7,,
96,0.97,531.731,541.574,It has Unfortunately become apparent that this work is a sweep operation.,7,,
97,0.97,541.574,545.945,Displacing people and deepening their homelessness and trauma instead of a shelter referral operation.,7,,
98,0.97,545.945,550.182,Lehigh works very closely with the navigation team to provide referrals to the villages we operate.,7,,
99,0.97,550.182,556.989,I like and appreciate the team members who I work with.,7,,
100,0.97,556.989,557.79,This is not about them.,7,,
101,0.97,557.79,563.029,It is about the misguided direction they are receiving and the misuse of the funding they receive.,7,,
102,0.97,563.029,570.97,"This direction appears to be shifting, moving people from one miserable such into another.",7,,
103,0.97,570.97,573.472,It worsens the crisis instead of getting people inside.,7,,
104,0.97,573.472,579.111,My name is Teresa Holman and I am from Lehigh.,8,,
105,0.97,579.111,592.725,"We are getting a lot of requests from people that, I was just a post in a council meeting where a couple came up to me and said we are in tent city and we just want to move.",8,,
106,0.97,592.725,593.793,I know this isn't about that.,8,,
107,0.97,593.793,597.43,I want to let you know that there is a strong desire for people to move into houses.,8,,
108,0.97,597.43,599.432,"And the sooner we can get them bills, the better.",8,,
109,0.97,599.432,602.702,We are having a problem also with appropriate referrals.,8,,
110,0.97,602.702,616.716,"So in communities where we have children where they are supposed to be clean and sober and we have referrals that are being made were they are not drug dependent, right?",8,,
111,0.97,616.716,617.85,So that has been a problem.,8,,
112,0.97,617.85,623.422,We are interested in working Tgether to solve this but the numbers are worrisome.,8,,
113,0.97,623.422,636.035,"So we just wanted to move on that as quickly as possible and whatever Lehigh can be doing to help with that, we appreciate we will be building more tiny House villages.",8,,
114,0.97,636.035,639.071,"The sooner we can get that done, the better.",8,,
115,0.97,639.071,640.272,We thank you for your support.,8,,

124,0.97,675.808,687.62,And we have seen those deaths accelerate along with the Sweeps.,10,,
125,0.97,687.62,690.222,We know Sweeps kill.,10,,
126,0.97,690.222,695.461,They drive people into desperation.,10,,
127,0.97,695.461,701.534,They drive people from bad conditions into worse conditions.,10,,
128,0.97,701.534,710.142,"If there was enough shelter and housing for everyone, the Sweeps would be unnecessary.",10,,
129,0.97,710.142,720.519,"And since there is not enough housing and shelter for everyone, the Sweeps are unconscionable.",10,,
130,0.97,720.519,726.625,You must do better.,10,,
131,0.97,726.625,727.293,There are alternatives.,10,,
132,0.97,727.293,734.967,You can be doing something Besides chasing homeless people around.,10,,

143,0.97,768.267,779.011,I read a report on a local news Blog and I was appalled with the lack of results.,13,,
144,0.97,779.011,781.48,And the fact that the city cannot do any better than that.,13,,
145,0.97,781.48,783.315,To offer people help.,13,,

359,0.97,1875.506,1883.615,This is your front-line job but it is not happening.,38,,
360,0.97,1883.615,1884.015,Six people.,38,,
361,0.97,1884.015,1887.285,I cannot take this.,38,,
362,0.97,1887.285,1896.261,There's going to be ample opportunity for us to drill down into Cross-Examining what the presentation provides today.,39,,
363,0.97,1896.261,1901.933,But I would like to let them get through the presentation and then we can open it up to presentations and commentary.,39,,
364,0.97,1901.933,1908.206,I do appreciate that you probably speak for some other members of the committee.,39,,
365,0.97,1908.206,1920.184,But I want the presentation to finish before otherwise we will be here all afternoon.,39,,
366,0.97,1920.184,1922.02,I didn't hear with the last sentence was.,40,,
367,0.97,1922.02,1928.826,"I thought I heard you say that everybody has, gets access to referral?",40,,
368,0.97,1928.826,1934.065,Every individual that the team engages with is offered shelter.,41,,
369,0.97,1934.065,1939.47,Every individual at the navigation team engages with is offered shelter?,42,,
370,0.97,1939.47,1939.671,Okay.,42,,
371,0.97,1939.671,1947.578,Recognizing that there are people in Encampments that the team does not have a chance to engage with.,42,,
372,0.97,1947.578,1962.193,That the team is not sent out to get Meds that are not subject to the 72 hour notice.,42,,
373,0.97,1962.193,1971.402,Recognizing that the team is not required to be engaged for the CBT and by police Removals.,42,,
374,0.97,1971.402,1988.219,"So the universe of people that the navigation team actually engages with appears to be very, very small.",42,,
375,0.97,1988.219,1997.729,"Every individual that the team engages with, including those that we partner with in CBT, for that work is offered shelter, storage, and supportive services.",43,,
376,0.97,1997.729,2005.136,"In 2019, the navigation team.",44,,
377,0.97,2005.136,2006.371,If you could pass for a moment.,45,,
378,0.97,2006.371,2011.009,"I want to say to everyone in the gallery, the Presenters listened patiently to everyone's public commentary.",46,,
379,0.97,2011.009,2012.51,So did the members of this Committee.,46,,
380,0.97,2012.51,2015.413,"Trust me, there's going to be tough questions asked of all of the Presenters.",46,,
381,0.97,2015.413,2022.153,We are going to deep dive into this presentation.,46,,
382,0.97,2022.153,2026.023,We just ask that members of the gallery please extend the same courtesy and respect to the representatives from Hst.,46,,
383,0.97,2026.023,2035.166,I would ask that you extend the same courtesy to members that have diverging views.,46,,
384,0.97,2035.166,2040.838,I want to recognize Councilmember Sawant for another question.,46,,
385,0.97,2040.838,2042.14,"I appreciate that, chair Lewis.",47,,
386,0.97,2042.14,2044.675,I have also understand that position you are in.,47,,
387,0.97,2044.675,2046.077,I want to do one more thing.,47,,
388,0.97,2046.077,2055.319,"Specifically on the interaction, every person being offered shelter.",47,,
389,0.97,2055.319,2057.088,That is simply not true.,47,,
390,0.97,2057.088,2062.36,We have one person sitting here right now who says they have never been offered shelter during the Sweeps.,47,,
391,0.97,2062.36,2076.407,"I know this is not an anecdotal inference here because I have talked to many hundreds homeless people, not one person has said to me that the Sweeps helped them.",47,,
392,0.97,2076.407,2078.009,They all say they hurt them.,47,,
393,0.97,2078.009,2085.95,So I would really urge you with the chairs penetration to take that into account and not have a tone deaf presentation.,47,,
394,0.97,2085.95,2088.085,It is Data-Driven.,48,,
395,0.97,2088.085,2091.622,What I am saying is Data- driven.,48,,
396,0.97,2091.622,2095.493,"Thank you, Mr. chair.",49,,
397,0.97,2095.493,2101.599,"Just put a finer point on the Data-Driven analysis that we have in front of you, believe me, we do want to hear the rest of your presentation.",49,,
398,0.97,2101.599,2119.484,But I think that we are having a hard time accepting that statement that Councilmember Herbold asked for . We see on the under located rate of referrals that there have only been 24% of the population who had been contacted by the navigation team.,49,,
399,0.97,2119.484,2123.588,"Again, this is the navigation team performance measures.",49,,
400,0.97,2123.588,2131.596,It is not taking into account any other entity that has reached out to the folks experiencing homelessness.,49,,
401,0.97,2131.596,2136.267,Only 24% of those had been offered a referral to shelter.,49,,
402,0.97,2136.267,2137.535,We will get into this later.,49,,
403,0.97,2137.535,2139.17,But only 6% had actually arrived at that shelter.,49,,
404,0.97,2139.17,2147.278,"So I think we can circle back to this after the presentation but our concern, my concern, I will speak for myself.",49,,
405,0.97,2147.278,2156.687,Everyone we come into contact with is offered shelter is just not reflected in the rate of referral to shelters according to the navigation teams on performance Metrics.,49,,
406,0.97,2156.687,2159.457,"I have also proposed, Mr.",49,,
407,0.97,2159.457,2162.36,"Chair, I want to make sure that we are being clear with the public.",49,,
408,0.97,2162.36,2175.339,"When we have the presentation in front of us, navigation team referral processes and my understanding if I am looking at this data is that this is not specific to the navigation team.",49,,
409,0.97,2175.339,2177.775,It is more a process slide as it relates to shelter programs.,49,,
410,0.97,2177.775,2178.309,If I'm correct.,49,,
411,0.97,2178.309,2184.248,We know that there is not 35% exit rate to permanent housing.,49,,
412,0.97,2184.248,2186.284,Just individuals who have been referred from the navigation team.,49,,
413,0.97,2186.284,2193.391,"In fact, the point that is still from my perspective not clear from the information that has been provided.",49,,
414,0.97,2193.391,2202.633,"Just to clarify, it needs a different title.",49,,
415,0.97,2202.633,2204.602,"Specific to the shelter process, is that correct?",49,,
416,0.97,2204.602,2208.206,My next comments talk about that exact thing.,50,,
417,0.97,2208.206,2208.639,Thank you.,50,,
418,0.97,2208.639,2210.241,"Jeff, do you have something to clarify?",51,,
419,0.97,2210.241,2214.845,I want to make sure we are clear on the materials provided.,52,,
420,0.97,2214.845,2217.148,I apologize if the label was not clear enough.,52,,
421,0.97,2217.148,2222.019,"The, I do understand the navigation team offers shelter during every engagement that happens.",52,,
422,0.97,2222.019,2232.797,"As a person is approached, they are told we have the opportunity to enter shelter and that represented the number of referrals occurring.",52,,
423,0.97,2232.797,2235.466,The number of people that say I would like to go to shelter.,52,,
424,0.97,2235.466,2236.867,You get the chance to do that.,52,,
425,0.97,2236.867,2243.975,I think there is an important difference between those two items.,52,,
426,0.97,2243.975,2252.083,We do know from testimony that often takes multiple engagements with people that have often had challenging interactions with various symptoms or are in a dramatic movement at the time.,52,,
427,0.97,2252.083,2254.752,Takes many touches for them to accept that.,52,,
428,0.97,2254.752,2259.39,So there's an important distinction between offered and the number that except as well.,52,,
429,0.97,2259.39,2261.192,Thank you.,53,,
430,0.97,2261.192,2269.967,Several of the points that you are raising are further in our presentation.,53,,
431,0.97,2269.967,2270.801,I thank you for that.,53,,
432,0.97,2270.801,2275.473,973 referrals to shelter.,53,,
433,0.97,2275.473,2285.816,"And an analysis, a recent analysis of other city funded average providers showed the navigation team referral rate section comparable to that of other city funded average programs.",53,,
434,0.97,2285.816,2295.726,"So when we talk about the utilization rate, Seattle shelters overall have a 97 percent utilization rate.",53,,
435,0.97,2295.726,2301.832,The receiving referred individuals and operating almost full capacity.,53,,
436,0.97,2301.832,2310.207,"Of those that enter shelter and receive support, we are seeing a 35% successful exit rate to personal housing.",53,,
437,0.97,2310.207,2315.913,The navigation team plays a key role in the systems effort to reduce on sheltered homelessness and exit people to permanent housing.,53,,
438,0.97,2315.913,2319.517,"On the next slide, to clarify that",53,,
439,0.97,2319.517,2326.657,"To clarify, my statement is accurate that this is actually a reflection of the shelter systems as a whole.",54,,
440,0.97,2326.657,2340.371,"I would assume that the 97% usage rate includes mats on the floor shelters and tiny homes, is that correct?",54,,
441,0.97,2340.371,2348.946,"But we do have, I do have a couple of data points specific to Lake Union village, which is 100% now team referral that has a 36% exit rate to permanent housing.",55,,
442,0.97,2348.946,2356.487,In the navigation center also navigation team only referrals has an exit rate of 32% access to permanent housing.,55,,
443,0.97,2356.487,2359.557,"Director Johnson, what is the number 978?",56,,
444,0.97,2359.557,2366.263,You mentioned the word process.,57,,
445,0.97,2366.263,2367.865,Which is the title of the slide.,57,,
446,0.97,2367.865,2374.238,This is meant to show the process that moves people from on sheltered homelessness to housing.,57,,
447,0.97,2374.238,2388.385,The 973 individuals at 97% usage rate is meant to show that we have a pretty much full shelter system.,57,,
448,0.97,2388.385,2397.094,And so it takes significant work to get individuals inside those shelters.,57,,
449,0.97,2397.094,2404.702,We are thing for the navigation team has some Set-Aside beds there held for the navigation team referrals.,57,,
450,0.97,2404.702,2406.103,Tara just mentioned one of those programs.,57,,
451,0.97,2406.103,2417.848,And then we are trying to also highlight that 35% of those that exit the shelter programs are Exiting into permanent housing.,57,,
452,0.97,2417.848,2419.65,The navigation referrals are part of that flow.,57,,
453,0.97,2419.65,2421.552,So this slide is really there to talk about process.,57,,
454,0.97,2421.552,2431.061,And talk about but these important navigation team referrals are doing.,57,,
455,0.97,2431.061,2431.862,What is 973?,58,,
456,0.97,2431.862,2440.171,That is the number of unique referrals to shelters that the navigation team had in 2019.,59,,
457,0.97,2440.171,2441.505,"Referrals, not people who arrived?",60,,
458,0.97,2441.505,2450.948,"If we will take a 35% rate and try to extrapolate how many people that were not only referred to shelter but accepted shelter and then exited permanent housing, it will not be 35%.",61,,
459,0.97,2450.948,2460.09,"It will be 35% of, assuming it is the same across all populations that are in that bed.",61,,
460,0.97,2460.09,2466.997,It is going to be 35%.,61,,
461,0.97,2466.997,2467.598,That is correct.,62,,
462,0.97,2467.598,2468.599,A very small portion.,63,,
463,0.97,2468.599,2469.8,It is difficult to do.,64,,
464,0.97,2469.8,2475.706,"But the 6% of shelter referrals were, they were confirmed.",64,,
465,0.97,2475.706,2480.811,Through Hmi us into a shelter within 48 hours.,64,,
466,0.97,2480.811,2492.189,"Now what we know is that when we look out seven days, 14 days, that many of those shelter referrals have made it to shelter.",64,,
467,0.97,2492.189,2496.126,But the Snapshot that we are trying to play close attention to is immediacy of that referral.,64,,
468,0.97,2496.126,2497.528,That is looking at the 48 hours.,64,,
469,0.97,2497.528,2502.132,So it will be difficult to just take the 6% and make assumptions across the board.,64,,
470,0.97,2502.132,2505.202,The flight is not intended to make those kinds of leaps.,64,,
471,0.97,2505.202,2518.949,But it is intended to just show an attempt to document the referral process and the important role the navigation team makes in that referral process.,64,,
472,0.97,2518.949,2519.45,Councilmember?,65,,
473,0.97,2519.45,2520.851,Did you have a question as well?,65,,
474,0.97,2520.851,2529.56,I had one question but now I have two questions because of what I just heard acting director Johnson say.,66,,
475,0.97,2529.56,2531.562,They just called into question the number.,66,,
476,0.97,2531.562,2541.205,"I am looking at the article that is titled, is Seattle navigation team producing results?",66,,
477,0.97,2541.205,2543.574,That is something that has been recorded in public testimony.,66,,
478,0.97,2543.574,2559.99,"And you said that the 6% moving it to shelters is not something that is accurately reflected in the results of the navigation teams work because it is talking about immediate results, results coming after 2448 hrs.",66,,
479,0.97,2559.99,2576.307,"I, to be honest with you, I don't know how to verify your numbers because you and your Department and the Mayor's office have done countless reports in my committee last year.",66,,
480,0.97,2576.307,2577.107,And the year before.,66,,
481,0.97,2577.107,2578.576,Now you're doing the same thing here.,66,,
482,0.97,2578.576,2580.344,Where we have no way of Verifying the numbers.,66,,
483,0.97,2580.344,2583.013,"So, if I take the words.",66,,
484,0.97,2583.013,2598.028,"Take the number at face value, it is still more troubling to me because when you sweep someone, that moment, but happens to them in their lives, that is what is important.",66,,
485,0.97,2598.028,2602.099,"In other words, what answer do you have to this question of, what happens to them in the ensuing 48 hours?",66,,
486,0.97,2602.099,2603.701,Those two days could be devastating for them.,66,,
487,0.97,2603.701,2611.475,Somebody who uses their Hard- earned $130 to have a Mattress and then the Mattress is destroyed or lost or taken away?,66,,
488,0.97,2611.475,2612.843,What did they do in those two days?,66,,
489,0.97,2612.843,2628.792,"I feel like we have to at least make an attempt to not only have a Cavalier approach, I am not saying anything is been done willfully but you have to have a different approach to this.",66,,
490,0.97,2628.792,2629.727,Than my original question.,66,,
491,0.97,2629.727,2635.466,It was sort of a question slash comment.,66,,
492,0.97,2635.466,2639.303,"The slide that we see up there, I have seen that slide many times.",66,,
493,0.97,2639.303,2652.216,"It is not about the navigation team, it is at least unintentionally misleading.",66,,
494,0.97,2652.216,2658.589,"It says navigation team referral processes, if you are not 70 who has seen the slide many times, heard a lot about it or talked to dozens of people, you wouldn't know.",66,,
495,0.97,2658.589,2660.391,This is not a result of an navigation team.,66,,
496,0.97,2660.391,2661.692,That is the intention of it.,66,,
497,0.97,2661.692,2667.898,To appear to give some data about the navigation team.,66,,
498,0.97,2667.898,2668.699,That is not true.,66,,
499,0.97,2668.699,2669.9,In this slide you clearly see.,66,,
500,0.97,2669.9,2673.203,"In 2019, the programs are primarily referrals from the navigation team.",66,,
501,0.97,2673.203,2673.771,97% and 35%.,66,,
502,0.97,2673.771,2676.673,Obviously other programs are more successful than the suites.,66,,
503,0.97,2676.673,2678.409,Those numbers are better.,66,,
504,0.97,2678.409,2683.714,And I know it is close to 100%.,66,,
505,0.97,2683.714,2684.982,We do not have shelter space.,66,,
506,0.97,2684.982,2687.184,"But at the very least, I think you owe us.",66,,
507,0.97,2687.184,2701.732,You have more honest slides and don't use slides that give numbers that are not about navigation.,66,,
508,0.97,2701.732,2704.835,"Councilmember Mosqueda, this will be the last question now.",67,,
509,0.97,2704.835,2709.64,I want to allow the Presenters to get through the presentation at which point we can ask questions until our heart's content.,67,,
510,0.97,2709.64,2710.14,Councilmember Mosqueda.,67,,
511,0.97,2710.14,2713.644,"Thank you, council member.",68,,
512,0.97,2713.644,2714.211,I appreciate that.,68,,
513,0.97,2714.211,2724.354,I appreciate the clarification that this is not navigation team only outcomes.,69,,
514,0.97,2724.354,2726.056,If you look at the second and third Icons.,69,,
515,0.97,2726.056,2732.663,"However, it was stated that these, this 793 individuals was referrals from the navigation team.",69,,
516,0.97,2732.663,2736.733,I am struggling to see where the number comes from.,69,,
517,0.97,2736.733,2749.046,I look at attachment a and I understand 973 is the total for each quarter of the total referrals to shelter categories.,69,,
518,0.97,2749.046,2749.98,That is a duplicated number.,69,,
519,0.97,2749.98,2754.651,So are we looking at a duplicated number at 973?,69,,
520,0.97,2754.651,2757.254,That will would not necessarily show individuals as it says on the slide?,69,,
521,0.97,2757.254,2761.959,I am not clear what document you are referring to?,70,,
522,0.97,2761.959,2762.76,The audit report?,71,,
523,0.97,2762.76,2764.795,So my understanding is that you have 973 individuals.,72,,
524,0.97,2764.795,2772.703,"If I look at the quarterly breakdown of total referrals to shelter, it totals 973.",72,,
525,0.97,2772.703,2782.279,"How to me, that is an understandable way for you to have arrived at that 973 number.",72,,
526,0.97,2782.279,2786.316,"If you are looking at referrals to shelter, it says Indiiduals.",72,,
527,0.97,2786.316,2786.717,You know?,72,,
528,0.97,2786.717,2798.729,"The conversations we have had of the last two years around data potentially being duplicated or not provided in a uniform manner and, I want to make sure I am clear.",72,,
529,0.97,2798.729,2805.802,973 referrals that are potentially located is that correct?,72,,
530,0.97,2805.802,2811.508,You are asking about that now.,73,,
531,0.97,2811.508,2812.509,Thank you for that.,73,,
532,0.97,2812.509,2814.244,I see what you're talking about with the discrepancy.,73,,
533,0.97,2814.244,2816.146,We will look into that and get back to you.,73,,
534,0.97,2816.146,2817.414,Thank you for pointing that out.,73,,
535,0.97,2817.414,2819.216,I see now what you are referring to pick,73,,
536,0.97,2819.216,2824.354,"Based on having what you are looking at for attachment a, 973 would be the total indicated referrals.",74,,
537,0.97,2824.354,2831.562,"There are individuals that may be encountered or the month and when you look at that number of people that actually arrived at shelter when you get to the located number, they do not always match.",74,,
538,0.97,2831.562,2835.666,You have individuals that accept a referral to shelter.,74,,
539,0.97,2835.666,2840.37,And then make it there and reappear on the street.,74,,
540,0.97,2840.37,2842.84,"Again, except a referral to shelter and arrived at the shelter.",74,,
541,0.97,2842.84,2846.577,So 80 duplicated number will only count for the individual wants.,74,,
542,0.97,2846.577,2852.983,The located number one account every time the person accepted a referral.,74,,
543,0.97,2852.983,2854.351,"In this case, only the referral.",74,,
544,0.97,2854.351,2854.885,Accepting that referral.,74,,
545,0.97,2854.885,2864.094,This is information that is delivered over the course of a year.,75,,
546,0.97,2864.094,2865.963,That is the other piece that the report talks about.,75,,
547,0.97,2865.963,2866.263,Fantastic.,75,,
548,0.97,2866.263,2866.964,Thank you.,75,,
549,0.97,2866.964,2871.034,You guys can proceed with your presentation.,76,,
550,0.97,2871.034,2879.509,The navigation team engages and builds relationships with people seven days a week.,77,,
551,0.97,2879.509,2884.882,This slide shows the total number of engagements from navigation team services.,77,,
552,0.97,2884.882,2895.192,Both duplicated and duplicated across the navigation team.,77,,
553,0.97,2895.192,2897.995,This data illustrates the repeated touch points we have with individuals experiencing homelessness.,77,,
554,0.97,2897.995,2909.606,"As we have mentioned before, each person in their situation is unique and our goal is to assist people in taking steps forward to saying yes to accepting shelter and supportive services.",77,,
555,0.97,2909.606,2926.657,"For many, the guest comes with a unique, nation of timing of the offer, engagement with supportive services and other stabilizing factors, and the right shelter being available at the time of the offer.",77,,
556,0.97,2926.657,2928.458,To meet that individuals needs.,77,,
557,0.97,2928.458,2943.34,"We connect with individuals over time and with compassion, giving them the time they need to get to their own personal yes and accepting alternatives to safer living.",77,,
558,0.97,2943.34,2944.141,Councilmember Herbold.,78,,
559,0.97,2944.141,2946.576,I am struggling so much to understand what that means.,79,,
560,0.97,2946.576,2952.916,You are talking about a slow approach when that will produce outcomes for individuals.,79,,
561,0.97,2952.916,2961.992,"But yet, we know 96% of that Removals done are exempt from any notice requirements.",79,,
562,0.97,2961.992,2966.997,I can't marry those two statements.,79,,
563,0.97,2966.997,2981.111,"I think what is important for us to remember is that our job as outreach provider, not just the navigation team, but the city's other 10 funded outreach providers, our job is to meet people where they are at in the moment.",80,,
564,0.97,2981.111,2985.048,Often our offers of shelter are declined.,80,,
565,0.97,2985.048,2995.125,People aren't ready for it because of their own unique barriers.,80,,
566,0.97,2995.125,3001.431,"People have personal choice and so even though shelter beds are available, that individual has to be willing and able to say yes in any given moment that the offer comes.",80,,
567,0.97,3001.431,3007.738,"Later in the slide, I will touch on the Dearborn Cloverleaf removal that happened a few weeks ago.",80,,
568,0.97,3007.738,3011.141,That is an interesting illustration.,80,,
569,0.97,3011.141,3015.245,There were Proximally 39 individuals at that site.,80,,
570,0.97,3015.245,3021.351,Both before the operation happened and during that were offered shelter services.,80,,
571,0.97,3021.351,3026.857,"Over the course of several days, only 10 of those individuals Excepted a referral.",80,,
572,0.97,3026.857,3033.93,Here you have an active process for removal where it has to happen for public safety.,80,,
573,0.97,3033.93,3035.899,And Cleanliness of environments.,80,,
574,0.97,3035.899,3039.269,Primarily public safety is what drove that need for that removal.,80,,
575,0.97,3039.269,3048.545,"But out of individuals who were offered a sincere bed, bed waiting, only 10 accepted.",80,,
576,0.97,3048.545,3049.78,That is every individuals personal choice.,80,,
577,0.97,3049.78,3066.797,"So our goal is to build relationships, Express compassion overtime to help use Motivational interviewing techniques, to help find out what will help move that individual to accept a Yes the next time that the offer comes.",80,,
578,0.97,3066.797,3068.965,"Is a member Herbold, did you have a follow-up?",81,,
579,0.97,3068.965,3069.666,I did not.,82,,
580,0.97,3069.666,3074.905,I understand that there was complexity to the relationship building aspect of outreach.,82,,
581,0.97,3074.905,3077.874,And where people are at.,82,,
582,0.97,3077.874,3081.411,As it relates to accepting offers of shelter.,82,,
583,0.97,3081.411,3097.427,"But my question was, how can you both say that you are offering people shelter when 96% of the income it's Removals are exempt from prior notice requirements.",82,,
584,0.97,3097.427,3105.435,The prior notice is the time necessary to build the relationships that you're talking about.,82,,
585,0.97,3105.435,3108.839,That make it more likely that people accept shelter.,82,,
586,0.97,3108.839,3124.955,"If you are not required to take that time, how can we possibly Úsay that the offers of shelter have occurred and are an opportunity, the people have a chance.",82,,
587,0.97,3124.955,3128.358,That they have the hours necessary to take advantage of.,82,,
588,0.97,3128.358,3135.699,One of the exciting developments that happens mid 2019 with the on boarding of the system navigators to the navigation team.,83,,
589,0.97,3135.699,3139.369,Is are specially trained outreach workers.,83,,
590,0.97,3139.369,3150.48,"That are embedded within the navigation team, we have a system navigator on call spots to respond to construction work in real time.",83,,
591,0.97,3150.48,3155.385,So that is the way offers of shelter are made.,83,,
592,0.97,3155.385,3161.758,System navigators are able to arrive on site when the visual asks for that.,83,,
593,0.97,3161.758,3162.893,Or ACCEPTS the offer to come.,83,,
594,0.97,3162.893,3168.465,We provide every opportunity we can to help connect people with services.,83,,
595,0.97,3168.465,3172.302,Even when prior notice is not required.,83,,
596,0.97,3172.302,3185.081,One of the things we provide in our Q1 advisor report with the table of obstructions that were not required to have advanced notice.,83,,
597,0.97,3185.081,3188.952,"Even some of those not required, we provide advanced notice.",83,,
598,0.97,3188.952,3196.693,"We also, we notice outreach was provided at over 30% of those sites within the two weeks prior to that site being removed.",83,,
599,0.97,3196.693,3204.634,"Again, that is illustrating our dedication to the compassionate service aspect while we were maintaining accessibility of public rights-of-way.",83,,
600,0.97,3204.634,3207.637,And reducing public health risks.,83,,
601,0.97,3207.637,3209.739,Associated with the income it's.,83,,
602,0.97,3209.739,3212.709,Councilmember Mireles?,84,,
603,0.97,3212.709,3221.618,You said that you gave the example recently of 39 individuals being offered but only 10 accepting.,85,,
604,0.97,3221.618,3226.256,"So when you are offering 39 people shelter, how do you confirm that there are 39 shelter beds available?",85,,
605,0.97,3226.256,3236.633,"With our low acceptance rate, so you see that the gap there between the number of individuals offered, we offer shelter at Dearborn.",86,,
606,0.97,3236.633,3240.87,So someone earlier mentioned a zoning on site.,86,,
607,0.97,3240.87,3251.281,"When we zone a large site for a removal, what we are doing is ensuring that we have the number of beds necessary to complete that zone.",86,,
608,0.97,3251.281,3254.317,"And as soon as those beds are full, the whole operation would stop,",86,,
609,0.97,3254.317,3255.952,Absolutely stop.,87,,
610,0.97,3255.952,3267.497,"If you're talking to people out on sites and you operate 39, how do you know that you have 39 beds to offer?",88,,
611,0.97,3267.497,3267.897,Sorry.,89,,
612,0.97,3267.897,3275.405,"So my question was, if you are offering 39 people shelter, how do you know that there are 39 beds available for them?",89,,
613,0.97,3275.405,3280.11,"On many occasions, we have had outreach go to the site several times fire to an event.",90,,
614,0.97,3280.11,3287.517,So we have a strong sense that the people have been offered multiple times on the day of the event.,90,,
615,0.97,3287.517,3295.925,"But we will often do is, we have already kind of structured according to what we have on average with beds each day.",90,,
616,0.97,3295.925,3300.23,We will create a zone knowing that the average period prior we maybe had 10 beds.,90,,
617,0.97,3300.23,3313.109,So that zone would only kind of encompass what we have on average.,90,,
618,0.97,3313.109,3316.279,'s of the data we have says there's an average of six beds available per day.,91,,
619,0.97,3316.279,3319.683,So I am trying to reconcile how we would know that we had 39 beds available.,91,,
620,0.97,3319.683,3322.152,"If we have six beds, we would zone to a six bed.",92,,
621,0.97,3322.152,3323.153,It might very.,92,,
622,0.97,3323.153,3329.659,But that is how we work our zones to say on average what we have is what we are going to zone two.,92,,
623,0.97,3329.659,3336.166,We move the clean and expanded a number of days to accommodate the body of work.,92,,
624,0.97,3336.166,3339.669,We may have a cleanup that is a one-day process.,92,,
625,0.97,3339.669,3344.074,We may have a cleanup that is three or four days.,92,,
626,0.97,3344.074,3348.578,So we can accommodate the ability to offer.,92,,
627,0.97,3348.578,3358.521,The important thing to remember is that we know going in on any day how many beds are available for that operation.,93,,
628,0.97,3358.521,3359.689,How do you know that?,94,,
629,0.97,3359.689,3364.594,We receive.,95,,
630,0.97,3364.594,3371.768,"So if that is the case, it seems to me that there shouldn't be a situation where you are moving people from a site without a bed to put them in.",96,,
631,0.97,3371.768,3381.678,"But the rate, but it is, Removals are up but referrals are flat.",96,,
632,0.97,3381.678,3382.112,Acceptance is flat.,96,,
633,0.97,3382.112,3389.819,So I am trying to recognize and reconcile the information we have.,96,,
634,0.97,3389.819,3391.421,"Frankly, we have people who decline.",97,,
635,0.97,3391.421,3393.923,We make offers and we have people who say they are not ready.,97,,
636,0.97,3393.923,3395.725,That is why we go back as many time.,97,,
637,0.97,3395.725,3397.927,We want the opportunity to Reengage and Reconnect with those people.,97,,
638,0.97,3397.927,3405.235,"We know, our hope is, it is a matter of time until people make the decision that they are ready to accept shelter.",97,,
639,0.97,3405.235,3405.435,,98,,
640,0.97,3405.435,3409.706,Councilmember Sawant?,99,,
641,0.97,3409.706,3420.65,"I want to profess a note that the underlying problem, why this is all happening, to echo the Testimonies.",100,,
642,0.97,3420.65,3423.953,The lack of affordable housing and immediate solutions.,100,,
643,0.97,3423.953,3434.464,"I want to note that it is really important that the city Council, at least a majority of the city Council, voted on a strong ordinance for expanding tiny House villages.",100,,
644,0.97,3434.464,3438.368,Now we have the task of funding the extended right we have.,100,,
645,0.97,3438.368,3452.782,"But I just wanted to know that, while the bureaucrats and employees of these departments are being grilled, the buck stops with the officials.",100,,
646,0.97,3452.782,3454.384,I want to make the note of that.,100,,
647,0.97,3454.384,3459.923,Also how wrong it was of the Mayor to delay the funding for the lead program.,100,,
648,0.97,3459.923,3465.762,"I want to note that in the face of tremendous data for success with the lead program, that has been delayed.",100,,
649,0.97,3465.762,3469.799,I am glad they played a role along with the public defenders and pushing forward.,100,,
650,0.97,3469.799,3475.705,I want to say that in advance.,100,,
651,0.97,3475.705,3485.748,"On those specific points you raised, I would like to hear from you, you put a special emphasis on the relationship and Compassin.",100,,
652,0.97,3485.748,3486.983,I completely agree with that.,100,,
653,0.97,3486.983,3499.095,"The problem is that because Sweeps have not had a beneficial effects on homeless neighbors, it is the other way around.",100,,
654,0.97,3499.095,3509.239,You will recall that the reach program quit the navigation team precisely in that letter.,100,,
655,0.97,3509.239,3517.313,They make it clear that it is her Cicely because their relationships and trust with the homeless neighbors with being eroded dramatically.,100,,
656,0.97,3517.313,3521.885,That is why they quit the program.,100,,
657,0.97,3521.885,3526.256,Because the way it is being run was not actually conducive to building the trust.,100,,
658,0.97,3526.256,3532.462,"I feel like the reality, the opposite of what you're saying and what you're saying is what we like to aspire to.",100,,
659,0.97,3532.462,3541.137,"The second thing in terms of, just to note, why are the vast majority of Sweeps happening?",100,,
660,0.97,3541.137,3543.773,That has not been answered.,100,,
661,0.97,3543.773,3549.345,The last thing is very important.,100,,
662,0.97,3549.345,3552.749,I hear this over and over again from the human services Department and from the Mayor's office.,100,,
663,0.97,3552.749,3553.683,That homeless people refuse shelter.,100,,
664,0.97,3553.683,3560.39,"First of all, we don't have Statistics to show how many times that is actually happened.",100,,
665,0.97,3560.39,3562.258,We have people saying that they were never offered shelter.,100,,
666,0.97,3562.258,3574.003,"But I think beyond that, you have to understand, it has to be brought out into the open that a lot of times when people refuse shelter, it is because they know it doesn't work for them.",100,,
667,0.97,3574.003,3591.354,"And I will urge you and I'm happy to send you the specific link from the Seattle Channel, to watch one of the committee meetings that I chaired last year and the year before.",100,,
668,0.97,3592.789,3595.992,"We had a homeless neighbors from the encamped, which is being swept over and over again.",100,,
669,0.97,3595.992,3601.831,"Where they said the reason they stopped accepting shelter, it was a young couple that said they stopped accepting shelter, because the stuff got stolen over and over again.",100,,
670,0.97,3601.831,3605.735,This alternate was not working because it was a solution for a few days and they were uprooted again.,100,,
671,0.97,3605.735,3612.442,"The encampment, even though it is outside and brutal, still they had friends and neighbors they were with.",100,,
672,0.97,3612.442,3620.35,They didn't want to be uprooted unless it was more permanent housing.,100,,
673,0.97,3620.35,3621.951,Councilmember Mosqueda?,101,,
674,0.97,3621.951,3625.722,I am aware you want to get us through the presentation.,102,,
675,0.97,3625.722,3630.927,I think we are on page five with 11 slides.,103,,
676,0.97,3630.927,3632.996,There was one comment I want to fully understand.,104,,
677,0.97,3632.996,3634.964,We can come back to it at the end.,104,,
678,0.97,3634.964,3636.833,But I wonder if there is an immediate response.,104,,
679,0.97,3636.833,3643.272,I want to say you are in a tough position.,104,,
680,0.97,3643.272,3646.743,I apologize that you are in this position to attest for something that is a city program.,104,,
681,0.97,3646.743,3654.05,So this question is not directed to you as individuals.,104,,
682,0.97,3654.05,3656.052,It is more a question about the entire program.,104,,
683,0.97,3656.052,3658.087,So thank you for being here along with director Johnson.,104,,
684,0.97,3658.087,3660.59,I am looking for anybody to help answer this question.,104,,
685,0.97,3660.59,3683.112,"In saying that we make an offer to all of the individuals who we are sweeping or that an offer of shelter is put out there for every location where sleep will occur, and the question that Council member Ross asked, house that reconciled with the very few limited numbers of beds each day?",104,,
686,0.97,3683.112,3700.129,"If on average in the last quarter we saw five mats on the ground, six beds in enhanced shelter, and one tiny House bills, we are talking about 12 beds total on average.",104,,
687,0.97,3700.129,3703.966,"Each one of these locations, each one of these 303 locations has more than 12 people I assume.",104,,
688,0.97,3703.966,3711.441,"So when you say that we are making an offer of shelter, it doesn't sound to me like we are making a meaningful offer of shelter.",104,,
689,0.97,3711.441,3723.719,"If we are knowing that in asking people, would you like to go to shelter, we are already assuming that a number of them will not go because of either trauma or the fact that they can't stay there with their loved ones or pet or kids.",104,,
690,0.97,3723.719,3727.423,It doesn't feel like it is a meaningful offer.,104,,
691,0.97,3727.423,3730.359,"So my question is, how is this lawful?",104,,
692,0.97,3730.359,3743.072,How is this in compliance with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that said you have to have a place for people to stay inside.,104,,
693,0.97,3743.072,3750.947,There has to be an of shelter beds and housing available as an alternative to sleeping on the sidewalk or in and Cam it.,104,,
694,0.97,3750.947,3754.784,It is unconstitutional to punish people for sleeping on the sidewalk when there are not enough shelter beds.,104,,
695,0.97,3754.784,3759.689,I don't understand how what we are doing is lawful if we are knowing that there is not a beds.,104,,
696,0.97,3759.689,3761.791,It is not a meaningful offer of shelter.,104,,
697,0.97,3761.791,3766.028,I will direct that at director Johnson.,104,,
698,0.97,3766.028,3774.003,The court case you are referring to was specifically Referencing arresting people for sleeping outdoors.,105,,
699,0.97,3774.003,3775.571,That is not happening in Seattle.,105,,
700,0.97,3775.571,3781.677,So that goodness that is outside of the Purview of our work.,105,,
701,0.97,3781.677,3787.517,"But to answer your question, beds are required for 72 hour in cabinet Removals.",105,,
702,0.97,3787.517,3805.401,"So the key point that we touched on earlier is that when those beds are full, if we are doing a 72 hour in cabinet removal and our available beds are full, we get the number of Yeses.",105,,
703,0.97,3805.401,3806.035,The whole operation stops.,105,,
704,0.97,3806.035,3807.036,It does not go forward.,105,,
705,0.97,3807.036,3810.039,But you aren't doing a 72 hour removal.,106,,
706,0.97,3810.039,3813.709,96% of what you're doing is exempt.,106,,
707,0.97,3813.709,3814.377,This is the frustration.,106,,
708,0.97,3814.377,3820.616,"Because I appreciate, as Councilmember Mosqueda said, you are in a tough position.",106,,
709,0.97,3820.616,3823.719,But the reality is that this all feels very Disingenuous.,106,,
710,0.97,3823.719,3826.322,I'm going to be candid.,106,,
711,0.97,3826.322,3828.791,This feels very Disingenuous.,106,,
712,0.97,3828.791,3841.17,"96% of what, the income is happening, they are exempt from counsel rules around the 72 hour notice.",106,,
713,0.97,3841.17,3853.382,And now you're using that as a justification for what you are doing.,106,,
714,0.97,3853.382,3854.35,I have to be honest.,106,,
715,0.97,3854.35,3860.456,"To say that the Ninth circuit is about arresting people and since we are not doing it, it's okay, is not right.",106,,
716,0.97,3860.456,3862.658,"The fact is, people are getting pushed off the streets.",106,,
717,0.97,3862.658,3864.093,There is nowhere for them to go.,106,,
718,0.97,3864.093,3869.599,We are spending an incredible amount of money having people from one place to another without actually providing services to them.,106,,
719,0.97,3869.599,3872.468,Without actually getting people into shelters.,106,,
720,0.97,3872.468,3875.137,We are losing Metrics of success.,106,,
721,0.97,3875.137,3885.815,"How much garbage we have cleaned up and property we have cleaned up, rather than the true metric of success which should be how many lives are we saving and how many people are we getting into housing.",106,,
722,0.97,3885.815,3887.884,That is what are Performance- based outcomes should be focused on.,106,,
723,0.97,3887.884,3897.26,"I haven't heard anybody talk about the real outcomes we are looking for, which is about protecting people instead of just property and trash cleanup.",106,,
724,0.97,3897.26,3901.731,I hear you.,107,,
725,0.97,3901.731,3906.402,And the work ahead of us is twofold.,107,,
726,0.97,3906.402,3906.836,So yes.,107,,
727,0.97,3906.836,3911.407,It is about connecting people to the services they need.,107,,
728,0.97,3911.407,3916.112,"And it is about making sure that our sidewalks, parks, trails, recreational areas are clear of debris.",107,,
729,0.97,3916.112,3916.913,"Sharps, garbage, human waste.",107,,
730,0.97,3916.913,3920.449,So that is not even getting cleaned up.,107,,
731,0.97,3920.449,3922.818,It is the people.,107,,
732,0.97,3922.818,3928.457,"Often, we are cleaning areas without having someone move.",108,,
733,0.97,3928.457,3932.128,So it is both.,108,,
734,0.97,3932.128,3943.572,"And I think we are paying a lot of attention, rightfully so, on what happens with individuals.",108,,
735,0.97,3943.572,3944.34,That is critically important.,108,,
736,0.97,3944.34,3954.684,"I know it is critically important to the human services Department, who is taking on the full responsibility of the work over the last year.",108,,
737,0.97,3954.684,3958.954,You guys changed the budget so the human services Department would be fully responsible for all aspects of the navigation team.,108,,
738,0.97,3958.954,3966.529,"But part of that work is also logistical, coordination.",109,,
739,0.97,3966.529,3968.497,Cleanup efforts to make sure that the city is clean.,109,,
740,0.97,3968.497,3969.899,That parks are usable.,109,,
741,0.97,3969.899,3973.369,That sidewalks are possible.,109,,
742,0.97,3973.369,3986.449,And there is a lot of efforts so the obstruction work you're talking about is very much about accessibility.,109,,
743,0.97,3986.449,3991.454,Making sure that debris and dangerous materials were removed from city side walks and city parks.,109,,
744,0.97,3991.454,3998.127,I would like to offer that some of the comments you are making are addressed as we go further on.,110,,
745,0.97,3998.127,4005.835,"If it is okay to proceed, I want to thank director Johnson for mentioning the litter removal work that we do.",110,,
746,0.97,4005.835,4007.703,We don't have a slide that talks about that.,110,,
747,0.97,4007.703,4019.148,But that work is in service of the people that are actually living in and can't that are not scheduled for removal.,110,,
748,0.97,4019.148,4025.287,We go in and not only offer outreach services but remove debris so that the living conditions at the location are better for the individuals in real time.,110,,
749,0.97,4025.287,4028.224,So I appreciate that you call that out.,110,,
750,0.97,4028.224,4040.569,"I have advanced the slide to start talking about Removals, which there are lots of focus on at the table.",110,,
751,0.97,4040.569,4059.088,"So you will notice in 2019 the number of 72 hour Removals increased, decreased between quarters 2 and 4. chemist subject to that process are the largest, most unsafe Encampments that have them greatest risk to public safety.",110,,
752,0.97,4059.088,4065.494,"It also requires significant resources with respect to time, labor, and equipment to conduct the removal.",110,,
753,0.97,4065.494,4069.999,Often take multiple days to complete.,110,,
754,0.97,4069.999,4084.38,Outreach by the navigation team and other city funded outreach providers occur before and during a 72 hour encampment cleanups.,110,,
755,0.97,4084.38,4086.315,And shelter is offered to 100% of those individuals.,110,,
756,0.97,4086.315,4088.884,"As we said previously, if shelter beds are full, the work would stop.",110,,
757,0.97,4088.884,4092.254,"If we advanced to the next slide, this shows obstruction work.",110,,
758,0.97,4092.254,4100.93,You will notice an increase between quarters two and three.,110,,
759,0.97,4100.93,4105.634,This increase in obstruction work is attributed to the expansion of now team operations to seven days per week.,110,,
760,0.97,4105.634,4109.939,As well as to a focused effort to address obstructions earlier.,110,,
761,0.97,4109.939,4119.648,To prevent them from growing into larger and more unsafe sites that require more resources.,110,,
762,0.97,4119.648,4122.051,Councilmember Herbold?,111,,
763,0.97,4122.051,4150.112,"As it relates specifically to the obstruction work you're doing, I in theory understand and support the efforts to to immediate Removals when things are truly obstructions and true hazards actually Impeding the public's ability to treat sidewalks and active use of parks.",112,,
764,0.97,4150.112,4161.257,We don't have any way of confirming that is how you are going to classify these locations.,112,,
765,0.97,4161.257,4165.261,We requested the obstructions which warranted the notice requirements.,112,,
766,0.97,4165.261,4168.998,This was a reporting requirement of this proviso report.,112,,
767,0.97,4168.998,4169.598,This was not provided.,112,,
768,0.97,4169.598,4176.505,We are trying to exercise our oversight as a body.,112,,
769,0.97,4176.505,4184.813,And the legislation that Council member O'Brien proposed actually looked very much like what you say you are doing.,112,,
770,0.97,4184.813,4191.787,Yu don't have any way of knowing.,112,,
771,0.97,4191.787,4194.189,The legislation allowed for immediate Removals on sidewalks and street right of ways.,112,,
772,0.97,4194.189,4203.699,But we don't today have any way of confirming that it is what is happening.,112,,
773,0.97,4203.699,4207.436,So that is why we have asked for that information so that we can exercise appropriate oversight role.,112,,
774,0.97,4207.436,4223.686,"I ask you, what do you recommend we do in understanding our responsibility and our interest in making sure that things are not being classified as obstructions and immediate hazards?",112,,
775,0.97,4223.686,4231.527,As a way to basically get around the Requiremens for advanced notice.,112,,
776,0.97,4231.527,4243.138,"The requirements that Encampments not be removed unless there is, I mean, to me there is a built-in incentive and I really hope that is not what is happening.",112,,
777,0.97,4243.138,4250.512,The fact that 72 hour Removals can only happen if there is available shelter and we know there is very little available shelter.,112,,
778,0.97,4250.512,4264.493,"To me that creates a situation, a bond for you guys where you are Incentivized to classify things as obstructions and immediate hazards because you don't have the shelter to offer.",112,,
779,0.97,4264.493,4274.203,That is a way for you to be able to do the work without having what I think we all collectively agree is a limitation on that work.,112,,
780,0.97,4274.203,4277.072,It is an important imitation on that work.,112,,
781,0.97,4277.072,4281.51,A limitation on work based on people's basic human rights.,112,,
782,0.97,4281.51,4291.487,"Based on what you say is most important to you, which is holding the importance of this work and the impact it has on people.",112,,
783,0.97,4291.487,4296.925,I appreciate your question.,113,,
784,0.97,4296.925,4302.731,About descriptions of obstructions that weren't an exception.,113,,
785,0.97,4302.731,4305.701,I am eager to hear the answer.,114,,
786,0.97,4305.701,4307.102,That is addressed on the next slide.,115,,
787,0.97,4307.102,4325.954,"S the Database that stores Oerations and information, as requested in the table in the proviso, it does not contain the level of detail about the site conditions that I think you were looking for.",115,,
788,0.97,4325.954,4329.458,That detailed information does exist but it exists separately from that Database.,115,,
789,0.97,4329.458,4331.66,It exists in what is called site journals.,115,,
790,0.97,4331.66,4341.637,"We have in the slide, as part of the first page of the site Journal, the site journals are posted Online.",115,,
791,0.97,4341.637,4344.473,They are publicly accessible.,115,,
792,0.97,4344.473,4356.085,So the picture up there is part of the Journal from the obstruction removal that happened at fourth and you Slur.,115,,
793,0.97,4356.085,4361.69,This whole site Journal that contains information and detailed information about the site prior to removal.,115,,
794,0.97,4361.69,4363.592,It is posted up on the Website.,115,,
795,0.97,4363.592,4373.902,The link is embedded in the Powerpoint electronic version.,115,,
796,0.97,4373.902,4376.872,And so that is where you can see the site characteristics.,115,,
797,0.97,4376.872,4387.116,I know it is hard to see up there but if you go Online you can see the site characteristics for the obstructions.,115,,
798,0.97,4387.116,4389.585,That might be the level of Granularity you are looking for.,115,,
799,0.97,4389.585,4392.02,"Unfortunately, in pulling data for the table, it doesn't exist in the Database.",115,,
800,0.97,4392.02,4394.69,And so I want to point out that this is where it exists.,115,,
801,0.97,4394.69,4400.162,Is publicly accessible to you all but also to the general public who are interested.,115,,
802,0.97,4400.162,4402.264,Is that something you can provide?,116,,
803,0.97,4402.264,4410.339,Councilmember Juarez and Council member morale us and Councilmember Sawant.,117,,
804,0.97,4410.339,4412.741,I have a quick question first.,117,,
805,0.97,4412.741,4427.956,"In the site Journal spreadsheet you have, there is health conditions identified at the site.",117,,
806,0.97,4427.956,4431.059,Is this information Aggregated in any way?,117,,
807,0.97,4431.059,4433.095,Made available in any kind of public dashboard?,117,,
808,0.97,4433.095,4447.543,Is there a way to store it and view the information not only for us as Councilmembers but members of the public to understand better and more broadly the nature of these in Chemnitz?,117,,
809,0.97,4447.543,4460.656,I think it does get to the information Councilmembers Councilmember Herbold and Councilmember Sawant have alluded to.,117,,
810,0.97,4460.656,4464.293,We want to be more forward facing about the nature of the camps being deemed obstructions.,117,,
811,0.97,4464.293,4477.739,"So I just wanted to, this is more a question about how this data currently is being provided in ways that we can make it more accessible and easier to break down and aggregate,",117,,
812,0.97,4477.739,4481.41,That is something that we can definitely look into.,118,,
813,0.97,4481.41,4490.285,"If a higher level of detail is needed, we can work with our data analyst to devise a way to make sure that it is easily portable.",118,,
814,0.97,4490.285,4494.489,In a way that is easy to understand.,118,,
815,0.97,4494.489,4496.625,We are glad to work on that.,118,,
816,0.97,4496.625,4496.892,Think.,119,,
817,0.97,4496.892,4500.496,Councilmember Juarez.,119,,
818,0.97,4500.496,4501.296,Thank you.,120,,
819,0.97,4501.296,4502.965,I know you have been pulling this information.,120,,
820,0.97,4502.965,4504.733,I want to reiterate what Councilmember Mosqueda said.,120,,
821,0.97,4504.733,4505.734,It is not easy.,120,,
822,0.97,4505.734,4507.135,We don't mean this personally.,120,,
823,0.97,4507.135,4522.417,"Because we as Councilmembers pointed out, of course Councilmember Herbold.",120,,
824,0.97,4522.417,4526.255,It is our duty to respond to our districts on the ground and working with that now team.,120,,
825,0.97,4526.255,4532.361,"As well, going to the site Journal and the sheet, these are basic ones.",120,,
826,0.97,4532.361,4533.262,When was it developed?,120,,
827,0.97,4533.262,4534.229,Who developed it.,120,,
828,0.97,4534.229,4540.602,Is there an opportunity to Revisit the checklist?,120,,
829,0.97,4540.602,4541.336,That is one section.,120,,
830,0.97,4541.336,4542.771,The other section of looking at it.,120,,
831,0.97,4542.771,4545.574,I have seen these before.,120,,
832,0.97,4545.574,4547.509,When you have the site characteristics and health conditions.,120,,
833,0.97,4547.509,4556.151,"You have criminal activity, open alcohol, I am wondering how subjective they are and who makes the decision.",120,,
834,0.97,4556.151,4556.785,What that means.,120,,
835,0.97,4556.785,4558.153,So that was a two-part question.,120,,
836,0.97,4558.153,4559.588,Thank you.,120,,
837,0.97,4559.588,4566.094,We work strictly by the world set.,121,,
838,0.97,4566.094,4571.733,Which defines many of these different characteristics.,121,,
839,0.97,4571.733,4576.505,"So as you all will know, the 1701 provides eight different points that we use.",121,,
840,0.97,4576.505,4586.415,"That pretty much are alluded to or, I don't have a better word.",121,,
841,0.97,4586.415,4589.017,That we focus on in order to do our body of work.,121,,
842,0.97,4589.017,4599.595,"So one of the things that is really important to say is that we want you to feel that we have great integrity, which is why we also photo Journal.",121,,
843,0.97,4599.595,4613.742,"Every single site we go to, there is a minimum of six photographs taken at every single site so it begins to give you some idea of what that site looks like before we start in the engagement.",121,,
844,0.97,4613.742,4616.244,And photos are taken as we leave the site.,121,,
845,0.97,4616.244,4623.352,So every field coordinator is trained to to the body of work.,121,,
846,0.97,4623.352,4624.186,By the same standards.,121,,
847,0.97,4624.186,4626.421,"But we are getting at is, when was this developed?",122,,
848,0.97,4626.421,4628.256,Who developed it?,122,,
849,0.97,4628.256,4634.563,"We have an opportunity knowing what we know, since we declared the war on homelessness in 2015, can we do that?",122,,
850,0.97,4634.563,4637.366,Those are Wonky questions we have.,122,,
851,0.97,4637.366,4639.635,This was developed first in 2016.,123,,
852,0.97,4639.635,4642.27,It was developed by me.,123,,
853,0.97,4642.27,4644.873,With the help of the health Department at that time.,123,,
854,0.97,4644.873,4648.777,It has been reviewed several times.,123,,
855,0.97,4648.777,4656.084,We are about to move to a form that allows us to Prioritize better.,123,,
856,0.97,4656.084,4660.155,The new App 2.0.,123,,
857,0.97,4660.155,4666.595,The work was advised by the health community as to how to Reformat this form.,123,,
858,0.97,4666.595,4671.099,And we will continue to photo Journal as well.,124,,
859,0.97,4671.099,4678.607,I have a quick follow-up based on Councilmember Juarez's question.,125,,
860,0.97,4678.607,4685.514,I actually had a similar observation.,126,,
861,0.97,4685.514,4686.815,"Councilmember Juarez, of the different categories.",126,,
862,0.97,4686.815,4687.983,My favorite one is disorganized.,126,,
863,0.97,4687.983,4691.219,That could describe my desk Emma which could be swept without notice I guess.,126,,
864,0.97,4691.219,4697.993,That I would just want to ask more broadly about the different conditions.,126,,
865,0.97,4697.993,4700.729,Are they waited the same?,126,,
866,0.97,4700.729,4701.53,Are they waited differently?,126,,
867,0.97,4701.53,4702.998,They are weighted the same.,127,,
868,0.97,4702.998,4712.14,"So hazardous materials and fires awaited, chemical waste, it is weighted the same as disorganized?",128,,
869,0.97,4712.14,4716.411,So what she was whispering is the new Prioritization is weighted to Frontally.,129,,
870,0.97,4716.411,4720.849,That is one of the things that the House committee brought to our attention.,130,,
871,0.97,4720.849,4726.154,It needs to be more critical in our thinking.,130,,
872,0.97,4726.154,4727.556,So vulnerability of the community has heavier weights.,130,,
873,0.97,4727.556,4731.46,The new system will be rolled out.,130,,
874,0.97,4731.46,4732.661,Thank you.,131,,
875,0.97,4732.661,4741.77,Council member morale us?,132,,
876,0.97,4741.77,4752.781,"I, well I feel like I need to preface this by saying that as a former Seattle human rights Commissioner and 70 who has been advocating against this operational method for a while, you probably sense my frustration that we are still engaging in this activity at all.",133,,
877,0.97,4752.781,4765.36,"But now that we have a Database in place, we have had some requests for a bit more input on the kind of data that would help us with our Oversights role.",133,,
878,0.97,4765.36,4785.08,"My question to you is, if you have got the data here and we would like to see it in a way that is more helpful, I would like to request that you include this analysis and summary in your quarterly reports to us so that we don't have to ask for it every time.",133,,
879,0.97,4785.08,4789.751,Is just something that is regularly made available to us so we can engage in our oversight role of what this process is doing.,133,,
880,0.97,4789.751,4791.72,Thank you.,134,,
881,0.97,4791.72,4794.789,Councilmember Sawant?,135,,
882,0.97,4794.789,4796.491,I want to echo what you said.,136,,
883,0.97,4796.491,4801.129,Some of the criteria that is disorganized that could apply to housed people.,136,,
884,0.97,4801.129,4806.902,So that your desk won't get swept.,136,,
885,0.97,4806.902,4808.236,Mine is disorganized and won't be swept.,137,,
886,0.97,4808.236,4809.838,I don't mean to be Facetious.,137,,
887,0.97,4809.838,4816.211,This is what our homeless neighbors face because they are homeless.,137,,
888,0.97,4816.211,4820.248,I think it is important that you draw out some of the criteria that the navigation team seems to use.,137,,
889,0.97,4820.248,4823.251,"In my view, it is not humane.",137,,
890,0.97,4823.251,4832.16,"Because, I mean, how do you stay organized when you have nothing going for you?",137,,
891,0.97,4832.16,4834.829,I don't think that is a fair criteria.,137,,
892,0.97,4834.829,4836.865,Or explain what you mean by that.,137,,
893,0.97,4836.865,4846.408,"But my question is, just a follow-up from the questioning from Councilmember Herbold.",137,,
894,0.97,4846.408,4847.242,Maybe I missed it.,137,,
895,0.97,4847.242,4876.204,"But if you are not allowed to do 72 hour notice Removals, without shelter available, and given that there is little to no shelter available at any given moment given the crisis in our city, then mathematically, the question is, does that mean that virtually all of the Removals happening are happening on the obstruction in the name of obstruction?",137,,
896,0.97,4876.204,4878.773,And so that brings back the same question.,137,,
897,0.97,4878.773,4887.349,"How do you a fine, defined, obstruction?",137,,
898,0.97,4887.349,4899.628,"We are talking about the citywide operation of Sweeps, per my early being conducted without noticed and primarily and presumably tilling with the question of pretext of obstruction.",138,,
899,0.97,4899.628,4905.934,"How, it is hard to imagine that every single sweep that happens in that way is justifiable from an obstruction standpoint.",138,,
900,0.97,4905.934,4908.203,You mentioned a couple of points.,139,,
901,0.97,4908.203,4913.041,I am glad that the site Journal in its current state is posted.,139,,
902,0.97,4913.041,4921.75,We are on the cusp.,139,,
903,0.97,4921.75,4933.561,"In engaging in continuous quality improvement, our improvement in our data collection that happened in 2019, some of the technological advances have been instrumental in our ability to report higher- quality data to you.",139,,
904,0.97,4933.561,4934.963,That we are continuing that continuous improvement.,139,,
905,0.97,4934.963,4939.234,We are on the cost of a new weighted Prioritization system.,139,,
906,0.97,4939.234,4943.471,"In March, we hoped to launch our navigation App 2.0.",139,,
907,0.97,4943.471,4952.647,I will be excited to bring not work back to you and to show you this is an old form from the beginning of the navigation teams work.,139,,
908,0.97,4952.647,4960.555,We are engaged in that quality improvement and I will be excited to show you the enhancements that we are making.,139,,
909,0.97,4960.555,4976.271,"Objections, the definition of what obstruction is, in the 1701, instruction is defined as tenants personal property, debris, other objects related to an encampment that are in a city park.",140,,
910,0.97,4976.271,4984.112,Or on public sidewalks that interfere with the pedestrians and transportation services or public Right-Of-Way.,140,,
911,0.97,4984.112,4988.984,Or interfere with as early as necessary or essential to the intended use of public property or facilities.,140,,
912,0.97,4988.984,5002.897,"I think when I think about obstruction, what really Resonates most for me is the accessibility piece for areas that might have limited mobility access needs.",140,,
913,0.97,5002.897,5010.405,"In 2000 and, we were the, we were contacted by a downtown employer whose employees use a wheelchair.",140,,
914,0.97,5010.405,5014.142,"Was having to drive in the street, in the busy street during the time.",140,,
915,0.97,5014.142,5019.047,Because the sidewalk was impassable with their chair.,140,,
916,0.97,5019.047,5022.05,They wrote to us and asked for assistance and not.,140,,
917,0.97,5022.05,5032.66,"For me, that access issue is at the core of what the city has responsibility for for all of its citizens.",140,,
918,0.97,5032.66,5044.172,"It is not for us to say, is a sidewalk passable enough for someone with unlimited site or mobility issues?",140,,
919,0.97,5044.172,5045.907,It is an important access issue.,140,,
920,0.97,5045.907,5046.474,The obstruction mark.,140,,
921,0.97,5046.474,5050.545,It does help the city maintain access for all individuals.,140,,
922,0.97,5050.545,5050.779,Yes.,141,,
923,0.97,5050.779,5055.083,Councilmember Herbold followed by Councilmember Mosqueda.,141,,
924,0.97,5055.083,5060.922,I would request that the executives consider defining obstruction as it relates to parks.,142,,
925,0.97,5060.922,5072.3,As only those instances that interfere with a planned program or programmed park use.,142,,
926,0.97,5072.3,5078.773,Or those places within a park that are defined as a critically sensitive area.,142,,
927,0.97,5078.773,5084.279,I am not asking that you stop encampment Removals and parks.,142,,
928,0.97,5084.279,5097.192,"I am asking that you consider giving prior notice, doing outreach, only doing the Removals if there is available shelter.",142,,
929,0.97,5097.192,5100.895,And committing to storage requirements.,142,,
930,0.97,5100.895,5109.571,"And in doing that for Encampments and parks when they are not in the middle of a playground or Ballfield, when they are not in a environmentally critical area.",142,,
931,0.97,5109.571,5113.541,That is a reasonable question and request.,142,,
932,0.97,5113.541,5118.546,I respectfully request that you consider that.,142,,
933,0.97,5118.546,5119.414,Change to your protocols.,142,,
934,0.97,5119.414,5120.615,Thank you for that feedback.,143,,
935,0.97,5120.615,5122.45,We will follow up with you on that.,143,,
936,0.97,5122.45,5124.652,Council member?,144,,
937,0.97,5124.652,5127.522,"Thank you, Mr. chair.",145,,
938,0.97,5127.522,5137.465,"That, what happens to an individual when they are on a sidewalk in a public place them in a part, but type of citation is given to them?",145,,
939,0.97,5137.465,5140.735,Last year we had a presentation talked about the number of citations given.,145,,
940,0.97,5140.735,5145.807,I think it was in conjunction with another element of the budget discussion from last year.,145,,
941,0.97,5145.807,5150.111,But I am wondering what happens to these individuals?,145,,
942,0.97,5150.111,5151.679,Are they given a citation?,145,,
943,0.97,5151.679,5159.587,"Currently, parks is not making exclusions from parks.",146,,
944,0.97,5159.587,5164.292,We make exclusions for any homelessness or on housed activities.,146,,
945,0.97,5164.292,5165.693,And parks they are not doing that.,146,,
946,0.97,5165.693,5176.271,You have to follow up with parks to learn more about the exclusion balls.,146,,
947,0.97,5176.271,5177.705,That relates to the parks Department.,147,,
948,0.97,5177.705,5181.109,What about the individuals who are a part of the community police teams and the patrol officers?,147,,
949,0.97,5181.109,5188.182,We have not had person cited for being on a sidewalk or obstructing.,148,,
950,0.97,5188.182,5188.883,Not in 2019.,148,,
951,0.97,5188.883,5190.084,Not that I am aware of.,148,,
952,0.97,5190.084,5198.426,"Again, we can follow up to be, to see if there has been any in 2020.",149,,
953,0.97,5198.426,5211.406,"When individuals are approached for obstruction related issues, with belongings that are Impeding the right of way, there is a request that they move, and a conversation that happens.",150,,
954,0.97,5211.406,5215.91,"The request is offered, we offer storage of belongings.",150,,
955,0.97,5215.91,5223.618,Offered have our system navigators come into outreach and make offer of shelter.,150,,
956,0.97,5223.618,5236.531,"For individuals that don't want a system navigator to come on site, they do receive a card with shelter information on it should they choose to access on their own.",150,,
957,0.97,5236.531,5239.667,We also allow people time to move their belongings.,150,,
958,0.97,5239.667,5243.471,"So the conversation is, Hey, your belongings are Impeding the sidewalk.",150,,
959,0.97,5243.471,5245.139,We will have to ask you to move.,150,,
960,0.97,5245.139,5248.977,We can give you time to pack up.,150,,
961,0.97,5248.977,5249.978,Would you like storage?,150,,
962,0.97,5249.978,5252.247,Are you interested in shelter?,150,,
963,0.97,5252.247,5254.082,Would you like a system navigator to come on-site?,150,,
964,0.97,5254.082,5259.354,We are finding that individuals are willing to comply with that move.,151,,
965,0.97,5259.354,5269.998,Some do accept the offer for the system navigator to come and have a meaningful conversation.,151,,
966,0.97,5269.998,5273.568,You can proceed with your presentation.,152,,
967,0.97,5273.568,5273.968,Thank you.,153,,
968,0.97,5273.968,5282.543,So we have talked about shelter referrals and that is what is illustrated on the slide.,154,,
969,0.97,5282.543,5285.113,It shows referrals to shelter.,154,,
970,0.97,5285.113,5293.488,"Paired with shelter enrollment data, the referral is defined as an individual that has said yes to a specific shelter bed.",154,,
971,0.97,5293.488,5309.537,And enrollment in the green on the slide is defined as the number of individuals that complete an intake at shelter within 48 hours from the time of a referral taking place.,154,,
972,0.97,5309.537,5314.175,"In late 2019, we have the ability for our system navigators to offer transportation.",154,,
973,0.97,5314.175,5317.645,We didn't have that ability prior to that.,154,,
974,0.97,5317.645,5323.685,"So there was a question on whether, what happens is not 48 hours?",154,,
975,0.97,5323.685,5328.222,"Once an individual except shelter beds, it is their choice how they get there.",154,,
976,0.97,5328.222,5328.856,The timing.,154,,
977,0.97,5328.856,5331.659,When they choose to arrive.,154,,
978,0.97,5331.659,5342.036,"That bed is communicated Rectally to the shelter, letting them know the bed is now taken by an individual who the individual is.",154,,
979,0.97,5342.036,5351.179,"The approximate time they will show up, so it is on an individual's own choice how they arrive.",154,,
980,0.97,5351.179,5357.585,We are pleased that now the system navigators are able to transport individuals and that is important to reduce transportation barriers.,154,,
981,0.97,5357.585,5360.088,Very real transportation barriers for people.,154,,
982,0.97,5360.088,5363.558,That people have getting from a site to a shelter.,154,,
983,0.97,5363.558,5368.963,We can transport belongings.,154,,
984,0.97,5368.963,5372.5,So the goal is to make it as easy as possible.,154,,
985,0.97,5372.5,5375.97,Not only for people to say yes to that shelter referral but to help them get there.,154,,
986,0.97,5375.97,5377.338,To help them get the Right-Of- way.,154,,
987,0.97,5377.338,5381.142,We know the immediacy of that next step is often very important.,154,,
988,0.97,5381.142,5389.55,I have a quick question as this relates to the tiny House villages and the transitional Encampments.,155,,
989,0.97,5389.55,5403.498,"So during the conversation over the last couple of weeks on the permitting ordinance, we heard a lot of testimony and talk to a lot of Stakeholders to vintage the transitional Encampments.",155,,
990,0.97,5403.498,5412.707,"So I wondered if you could give us a brief overview of how many transitional Encampments, or merely take have team referrals.",155,,
991,0.97,5412.707,5417.745,Then comment on the low vacancy rate.,155,,
992,0.97,5417.745,5425.52,"It seems like that one minute you affirmed it was accurate, one opening per day from the tiny House village system.",155,,
993,0.97,5425.52,5434.228,It X Lucidly takes NAV referrals.,155,,
994,0.97,5434.228,5436.13,Maybe this is beyond the scope of your presentation.,155,,
995,0.97,5436.13,5440.368,Is it because we have a bottleneck of folks moving on to that point to the permanent supportive housing?,155,,
996,0.97,5440.368,5445.773,We have a lot of folks stuck in that transitional period and that is creating a demand issue?,155,,
997,0.97,5445.773,5447.675,Or a supply issue?,155,,
998,0.97,5447.675,5467.829,"And if that is the case, would additional transitional Encampments be a, something that would be useful for getting more folks into placement based on NAV team contact?",155,,
999,0.97,5467.829,5475.503,We do know from our work with individuals that tiny House villages are the most sought after resource.,156,,
1000,0.97,5475.503,5480.141,"All, they are also the most recently available resource.",156,,
1001,0.97,5480.141,5491.319,Hst is evaluating the mix of its investments and I will let director Johnson speaks to the system.,156,,
1002,0.97,5491.319,5493.888,So the availability of a shelter bed is definitely an issue.,157,,
1003,0.97,5493.888,5504.966,And it is part of our work to consistently work towards adding to the capacity of our emergency housing.,157,,
1004,0.97,5504.966,5505.299,Availability.,157,,
1005,0.97,5505.299,5508.336,We do that into parts.,157,,
1006,0.97,5508.336,5510.204,We do that by creating more shelter beds.,157,,
1007,0.97,5510.204,5513.241,By creating more tiny House villages.,157,,
1008,0.97,5513.241,5517.745,A variety of different kinds or types of emergency shelter.,157,,
1009,0.97,5517.745,5530.591,But we also do that by trying to make sure that there is a movement out of shelters into housing.,157,,
1010,0.97,5530.591,5541.469,"What we are seeing with the tiny House villages as terrorist just said, they are the resource that, when available, people are most likely to say yes to.",157,,
1011,0.97,5541.469,5551.879,"This is an environment, a Non- congregate Impairments where and individual has a roof overhead, hard walls, it is not a congregate shelter space.",157,,
1012,0.97,5551.879,5557.551,It is also all of the enhancements of many of our enhanced shelters.,157,,
1013,0.97,5557.551,5558.452,So it has case management.,157,,
1014,0.97,5558.452,5558.953,Has hygiene.,157,,
1015,0.97,5558.953,5559.253,Has meals.,157,,
1016,0.97,5559.253,5564.659,It has a variety of the enhancements that we want in place for all of our shelters.,157,,
1017,0.97,5564.659,5570.298,"But it is, some of the shelters aren't possible due to some of the more basic shelters.",157,,
1018,0.97,5570.298,5571.565,Do today use during the day.,157,,
1019,0.97,5571.565,5575.67,Or size restrictions.,157,,
1020,0.97,5575.67,5584.178,"What is exciting is, I just had the opportunity to meet with Lehigh.",157,,
1021,0.97,5584.178,5598.793,What they were able to share is some of the data that shows that tiny House villages overall are Exiting people into permanent housing at the same or slightly higher rate than any of our enhanced shelters.,157,,
1022,0.97,5598.793,5614.208,"When you add in movement across the shelters or transitional housing, then that throughput, those programs, it reaches close to 60%.",157,,
1023,0.97,5614.208,5629.023,"So we are seeing that number one, this is a resource that people living in shelters, that were engaged to the navigation team, we are saying that there are the services that we know people need.",157,,
1024,0.97,5629.023,5629.857,Available at the sites.,157,,
1025,0.97,5629.857,5635.596,And we are seeing the throughput that we want in this programs.,157,,
1026,0.97,5635.596,5654.849,Those three elements put together make us both encouraged by the programs we have existing but also have us looking at how we might be able to add more.,157,,
1027,0.97,5654.849,5655.449,Councilmember Mosqueda?,158,,
1028,0.97,5655.449,5657.885,"Thank you, Mr. chair.",159,,
1029,0.97,5657.885,5659.72,The chairs point is really well taken.,159,,
1030,0.97,5659.72,5663.891,"When he is asking, where is the bottleneck?",159,,
1031,0.97,5663.891,5686.714,"And we know that there are only five mats on the floor, one tiny House village available, on average in the last quarter, then really, it does seem like the navigation team is not able to navigate people anywhere.",159,,
1032,0.97,5686.714,5688.516,If the number of beds is so low.,159,,
1033,0.97,5688.516,5693.421,"So let's assume best intentions that if there were the ability to get folks into available beds, then there would be a higher success rate.",159,,
1034,0.97,5693.421,5699.727,"But now, my concern is, the navigation team isn't able to navigate people into the shelters without opening.",159,,
1035,0.97,5699.727,5707.034,We have $7.67 million total for the navigation team if you break that down over a quarter.,159,,
1036,0.97,5707.034,5709.904,It is $1.919 million.,159,,
1037,0.97,5709.904,5720.848,"If we were only able to get 45 individuals into shelters, that breaks down to around $42,600 per person.",159,,
1038,0.97,5720.848,5721.248,In that quarter.,159,,
1039,0.97,5721.248,5727.121,"I mean, we think that it would be a much, I think it would be a really great answer to the chairs question.",159,,
1040,0.97,5727.121,5740.167,How could we better utilize that $1.9 million a quarter and allocate it to creating the tiny homes.,159,,
1041,0.97,5740.167,5742.57,To creating the enhanced shelters that we now have high success rates.,159,,
1042,0.97,5742.57,5743.971,Not to mention the affordable housing we need.,159,,
1043,0.97,5743.971,5752.747,"That I feel like for us, as we have a die leg about how to best utilize public dollars, I think it is an answer to the question that you have asked.",159,,
1044,0.97,5752.747,5754.415,How do we help navigate people into shelter.,159,,
1045,0.97,5754.415,5763.424,It doesn't feel like we have created the tools for the program to be successful when we don't have the shelters available.,159,,
1046,0.97,5763.424,5769.797,"It doesn't feel like we are doing the right thing at this point we don't have enough shelters, when police are involved with moving folks from corner to corner.",159,,
1047,0.97,5769.797,5772.867,Because folks don't feel safe or because there is not a bed available for them.,159,,
1048,0.97,5772.867,5792.92,"Again, when you look at the total number of dollars Allocatd to this program, only 45 individuals that into shelter, I think the real financial cost comes into the call to question around whether we should be investing in tiny homes or enhanced shelters.",159,,
1049,0.97,5792.92,5809.637,"Secondly, I think that it is important for us to note that of the 45 people, we still don't have the data on how many of those got into permanent supportive housing or affordable housing.",159,,
1050,0.97,5809.637,5813.24,That is still a data point I would love for us to get on the quarterly basis as well.,159,,
1051,0.97,5813.24,5815.309,I applied you for including the number of open beds.,159,,
1052,0.97,5815.309,5817.344,I know you have heard from me for 2 years.,159,,
1053,0.97,5817.344,5819.146,Last quarter it was also something I asked for.,159,,
1054,0.97,5819.146,5822.016,Now in this report I see that we have gotten back about 5/4.,159,,
1055,0.97,5822.016,5822.449,I appreciate that.,159,,
1056,0.97,5822.449,5833.16,"But I think what helps us to underscore is that it is not possible to navigate people into shelters, let alone housing, we are not directing dollars in that way.",159,,
1057,0.97,5833.16,5843.337,"It appears that it would be a or use of dollars, versus the 40 foot $42,000 it has taken to get into one child.",159,,
1058,0.97,5843.337,5845.172,Two points of clarification if I could.,160,,
1059,0.97,5845.172,5853.881,The 45 is a number of people that we have confirmed have entered into shelter after a 48 hour period.,160,,
1060,0.97,5853.881,5861.288,It is not to say that any of our other engagements have not successfully resulted in a shelter placement.,160,,
1061,0.97,5861.288,5864.258,They could have taken more time.,160,,
1062,0.97,5864.258,5876.003,"But the data that you have your, the 45, it is not to say that in the fourth quarter the navigation team only resulted in 45 people going to shelters.",160,,
1063,0.97,5876.003,5878.072,But it is the data point that we have access to.,160,,
1064,0.97,5878.072,5878.906,Slightly imperfect data points.,160,,
1065,0.97,5878.906,5887.815,But it shows 45 individuals made it into shelter within a 48 hour period.,160,,
1066,0.97,5887.815,5891.886,"Secondly, you made the comment that the navigation team is not navigating to anything.",160,,
1067,0.97,5891.886,5903.063,"And the next slide, the type of services that individuals request when there is engagement.",160,,
1068,0.97,5903.063,5905.099,I know Tara will talk about this in more detail.,160,,
1069,0.97,5905.099,5912.006,"I wanted to highlight that while shelters and getting people indoors is our goal, it is not always someone else's goal.",160,,
1070,0.97,5912.006,5915.042,You might see they want a connection in case management.,160,,
1071,0.97,5915.042,5917.845,They may need a pair of socks or work boots.,160,,
1072,0.97,5917.845,5922.95,They may need to get a referral around employment.,160,,
1073,0.97,5922.95,5930.224,So it is critically important that we are helping people navigate towards shelter.,160,,
1074,0.97,5930.224,5932.126,Towards getting indoors.,160,,
1075,0.97,5932.126,5941.969,"The system navigators and the field cord meters are trying to help people access, navigate to a variety of different resources.",160,,
1076,0.97,5941.969,5945.673,I wanted to call that out.,160,,
1077,0.97,5945.673,5947.541,"Council member Mireles, did you have a question?",161,,
1078,0.97,5947.541,5947.942,I do.,162,,
1079,0.97,5947.942,5955.082,"So I am glad to hear that you agreed the demands for tiny home villages, that that is a good option for people.",163,,
1080,0.97,5955.082,5958.886,"Could you give us in a sense, how many shelters we need?",163,,
1081,0.97,5958.886,5961.755,How many tiny home villages we need?,163,,
1082,0.97,5961.755,5970.13,That would actually meet the needs?,164,,
1083,0.97,5970.13,5970.497,No.,165,,
1084,0.97,5970.497,5972.166,It would be a guess at this point.,165,,
1085,0.97,5972.166,5988.615,"I know by looking into our homeless management information system, that we have well over 20,000 households who are engaged in some kind of effort to seek help because of their housing instability.",165,,
1086,0.97,5988.615,5998.325,"We know that because effort to do a one night senses, we have a point in time count of how many people are living on sheltered in our community.",165,,
1087,0.97,5998.325,6012.94,"We also know through the kinds of engagement, we are able to have, how many folks we are engaged with on a regular basis to the navigation team.",165,,
1088,0.97,6012.94,6023.183,It would take analysis of all of those data points to understand exactly how much shelter would be helpful.,165,,
1089,0.97,6023.183,6028.355,And this is the point in the discussion about bottleneck.,165,,
1090,0.97,6028.355,6033.227,"If we built enough shelter, we would have another bottleneck, which would be at the front door of housing.",165,,
1091,0.97,6033.227,6040.234,"So you know, you will never hear me say, let's not get more shelter.",165,,
1092,0.97,6040.234,6052.246,We need more people to come indoors.,165,,
1093,0.97,6052.246,6053.981,But it does move the Goalpost in a way.,166,,
1094,0.97,6053.981,6055.649,It creates a different kind of bottleneck.,166,,
1095,0.97,6055.649,6063.09,What I'm trying to understand is how many of the newly authorized in Chemnitz we created we should plan to fund this year because it will be the next step to removing some of the bottleneck.,167,,
1096,0.97,6063.09,6065.793,We will I'm sure be having conversation about how many we will be funding.,167,,
1097,0.97,6065.793,6086.88,"The really important part is that if folks cannot sleep where they are causing obstruction, if they cannot sleep any place because that is considered camping and we are not allowing that anymore, if there are not enough shelter beds and places for people to go, where do you propose the homeless neighbors sleep when it is time for them to sleep at night?",167,,
1098,0.97,6086.88,6088.515,I don't necessarily have an answer to that.,168,,
1099,0.97,6088.515,6094.388,Except by saying we share your concern about the enrollment rate.,168,,
1100,0.97,6094.388,6095.255,We too want our enrollments.,168,,
1101,0.97,6095.255,6103.73,We would like every offer of shelter to be accepted and enrolled and to meet the goal of more people moving indoors.,168,,
1102,0.97,6103.73,6109.903,To where it is a safer alternative in supportive services.,168,,
1103,0.97,6109.903,6122.216,"I want to stress that the navigation team, that no entity within the city of Seattle is punishing people for sleeping overnight.",168,,
1104,0.97,6122.216,6127.955,That is not something that our city does.,168,,
1105,0.97,6127.955,6132.359,People Ae able to sleep through the overnight hours and the navigation team does not move individuals during the overnight hours.,168,,
1106,0.97,6132.359,6134.228,People are able to bed down and rest.,168,,
1107,0.97,6134.228,6136.663,That is a fundamental human rights.,168,,
1108,0.97,6136.663,6140.734,That the work of the navigation team absolutely supports.,168,,
1109,0.97,6140.734,6151.512,"When we talk about enrollment, I want to stress that referrals and enrollments, the goal of helping people move indoors is shared.",168,,
1110,0.97,6151.512,6158.385,The navigation team shares that responsibility with the 10 other funded outreach programs.,168,,
1111,0.97,6158.385,6159.586,That the city of Seattle funds.,168,,
1112,0.97,6159.586,6164.324,We all have that responsibility to help individuals say yes to shelter.,168,,
1113,0.97,6164.324,6168.595,To help them access other alternatives and other supports.,168,,
1114,0.97,6168.595,6175.602,"We talk about money well spent, it is important that we not just look at the part about getting people indoors.",168,,
1115,0.97,6175.602,6180.908,That is a core mission of the navigation team.,168,,
1116,0.97,6180.908,6186.813,But the other part we need to remember is the disability of our public sidewalks.,168,,
1117,0.97,6186.813,6187.214,Rights-of-way.,168,,
1118,0.97,6187.214,6194.788,As well as public health and Cleanliness of our green spaces.,168,,
1119,0.97,6194.788,6199.026,The work of the navigation team supports all of Seattle in many different ways.,168,,
1120,0.97,6199.026,6213.84,"I would stress that while we are all as a system of outreach providers doing better to increase the number of Yeses that we get, that the navigation team does serve the whole of Seattle.",168,,
1121,0.97,6213.84,6216.843,Dr. Johnson raised a point about enrollment.,169,,
1122,0.97,6216.843,6224.151,I want to stress that the process of matching a referral to an enrollment is a difficult process.,169,,
1123,0.97,6224.151,6228.722,It is likely that our moment numbers are higher than what we see here.,169,,
1124,0.97,6228.722,6233.06,The difficulty comes in two separate databases collecting this Infrmation.,169,,
1125,0.97,6233.06,6235.562,Holding them with privacy laws.,169,,
1126,0.97,6235.562,6238.231,Across each.,169,,
1127,0.97,6238.231,6247.14,So each of those databases also has allowed individuals to opt out of sharing information.,169,,
1128,0.97,6247.14,6247.341,Out.,169,,
1129,0.97,6247.341,6253.914,So the Cross-Referencing aspect of two different databases is very difficult.,169,,
1130,0.97,6253.914,6255.315,It is likely that this is higher.,169,,
1131,0.97,6255.315,6259.753,This is the best we can do.,169,,
1132,0.97,6259.753,6262.222,With individual that has allowed information to be shared.,169,,
1133,0.97,6262.222,6266.059,So that is an important point.,169,,
1134,0.97,6266.059,6268.495,Mike Councilmember Sawant had a question.,169,,
1135,0.97,6268.495,6269.496,Then Councilmember Mosqueda.,169,,
1136,0.97,6269.496,6272.099,"Thank you so much, chair.",170,,
1137,0.97,6272.099,6285.312,I appreciate you allowing myself and other members of the committee to weigh in . I have to give my apologies in advance.,170,,
1138,0.97,6285.312,6286.113,I might have to leave.,170,,
1139,0.97,6286.113,6289.816,I want to say a few things in relation to some of the points that have come up.,170,,
1140,0.97,6289.816,6292.452,Just because of the nature of the problems we face in our city.,170,,
1141,0.97,6292.452,6294.655,It is not just erected at the human services Department.,170,,
1142,0.97,6294.655,6300.327,You know my points are larger in terms of what our duties are as a Council.,170,,
1143,0.97,6300.327,6315.609,"I just, I mean I strongly agree with Councilmember Mosqueda who said we should be using resources not on programs that are proven to not work but on programs proven to work.",170,,
1144,0.97,6315.609,6326.153,I am all for we direct ring public funds away from Sweeps and into tiny House villages.,170,,
1145,0.97,6326.153,6333.46,But it also compels me to remind the Council and members of the public that our movement has been fighting for that.,170,,
1146,0.97,6333.46,6339.566,"Unfortunately, the cancel has not supported the measures.",170,,
1147,0.97,6339.566,6342.002,The people's budget movement in my office have been fighting for that.,170,,
1148,0.97,6342.002,6349.976,Last year we had a concrete proposal to use the million spent on Sweeps instead to use for counsel for tiny House villages.,170,,
1149,0.97,6349.976,6353.18,This was 2019.,170,,
1150,0.97,6353.18,6359.92,2008 Kim my office propose to use millions spent on Sweeps for affordable housing.,170,,
1151,0.97,6359.92,6360.687,The council voted no.,170,,
1152,0.97,6360.687,6368.195,"In 2017, the movement proposed the funds to prohibit Sweeps.",170,,
1153,0.97,6368.195,6368.995,The council voted no.,170,,
1154,0.97,6368.995,6377.104,"In 2017, notably, the people's budget movement also successfully organized a peaceful occupation of this city hall overnight, which many of us worked hard on.",170,,
1155,0.97,6377.104,6380.407,It is a very successful peaceful disobedience.,170,,
1156,0.97,6380.407,6384.01,We proposed a proviso for Sweeps.,170,,
1157,0.97,6384.01,6384.678,The council voted no.,170,,
1158,0.97,6384.678,6397.924,I am in earnest here urging the Council to take progressive measures on this and not simply just direct these questions to the human services Department.,170,,
1159,0.97,6397.924,6399.393,Presumably they are not elected officials.,170,,
1160,0.97,6399.393,6399.659,We are.,170,,
1161,0.97,6399.659,6402.929,And I want also publicly announce having heard what I just heard.,170,,
1162,0.97,6402.929,6405.399,That my office is happy.,170,,
1163,0.97,6405.399,6406.6,We will be doing this now.,170,,
1164,0.97,6406.6,6414.674,To bring us a supplemental budget to bring Sweeps to tiny House funding.,170,,
1165,0.97,6414.674,6416.81,We will do that.,170,,
1166,0.97,6416.81,6425.118,I wanted to say that in public view because I want the public to make sure the Council is accountable on the things.,170,,
1167,0.97,6425.118,6425.919,It is not enough.,170,,
1168,0.97,6425.919,6436.463,"It is good that we are having this very tough discussion but at the same time, it is not enough to put the book on somebody else's plate.",170,,
1169,0.97,6436.463,6438.064,We have to step up and do this.,170,,
1170,0.97,6438.064,6442.769,"Unfortunately, we have had a track record on this that is of not having done that.",170,,
1171,0.97,6442.769,6444.538,I hope that we do that in the future.,170,,
1172,0.97,6444.538,6454.181,I am encouraged by the fact that we just passed the moratorium legislation and a tiny House zoning which came from the movement in my office.,170,,
1173,0.97,6454.181,6459.186,I hope that bodes well with you two.,170,,
1174,0.97,6459.186,6459.986,Councilmember Mosqueda?,171,,
1175,0.97,6459.986,6473.6,"So director Johnson, you made a comment and I believe you also echoed it about the number of individuals referred to shelter beds is not all you do.",172,,
1176,0.97,6473.6,6480.34,My point was a navigation team that is working with those who are on sheltered.,172,,
1177,0.97,6480.34,6488.348,The ideal goal is to give folks shelter.,172,,
1178,0.97,6488.348,6500.694,"We also required of the 10 organizations that I believe you are Referencing, for them to have the primary goal to the extent that these organizations have to have 60% of the individuals that they work with referred to shelter.",172,,
1179,0.97,6500.694,6503.363,It doesn't appear we are holding ourselves to that same standard.,172,,
1180,0.97,6503.363,6507.334,All of these services are on the slide are great.,172,,
1181,0.97,6507.334,6509.402,I'm glad we were able to do some of those.,172,,
1182,0.97,6509.402,6521.948,"But we seem to have different standards of success for the navigation team versus entities like the Seattle Club, youth care, urban leg.",172,,
1183,0.97,6521.948,6531.358,These are just some of the organizations that we have contracted with where they have a requirement that they get 60% of the individuals that they are working with into shelters.,172,,
1184,0.97,6531.358,6537.364,"So yes, I understand that shelters are not the only thing we judge ourselves by.",172,,
1185,0.97,6537.364,6538.665,Why the discrepancy?,172,,
1186,0.97,6538.665,6541.935,The 60% is a systemwide target.,173,,
1187,0.97,6541.935,6546.172,It is not a mandate to the human services Department.,173,,
1188,0.97,6546.172,6556.583,It is a systemwide target that out reach providers get 60% of them referrals moved to shelter.,173,,
1189,0.97,6556.583,6558.351,This pay get affected by performance contracts?,174,,
1190,0.97,6558.351,6562.756,There is no performance pay reduction if they complete the target.,175,,
1191,0.97,6562.756,6568.795,"Again, this is a systemwide target that has been done Countywide.",175,,
1192,0.97,6568.795,6574.0,We put the targets into all of our outreach contracts.,175,,
1193,0.97,6574.0,6575.001,It is not a mandate.,175,,
1194,0.97,6575.001,6589.816,"But I believe Tara shared earlier ways that on average, the navigation team's success rate is similar to those other outreach programs.",175,,
1195,0.97,6589.816,6596.923,So we tried to keep ourselves to the exact same standard as our contracted outreach programs.,175,,
1196,0.97,6596.923,6604.631,The one thing that is not standard is the kind of data that we collect.,175,,
1197,0.97,6604.631,6615.208,So there's a lot more data collected on the navigation team then collected by any other outreach program.,175,,
1198,0.97,6615.208,6618.778,You will read notes that we track every single interaction a navigation team has with an individual.,175,,
1199,0.97,6618.778,6619.245,We do.,175,,
1200,0.97,6619.245,6620.447,Eight that as an interaction.,175,,
1201,0.97,6620.447,6626.553,We do not require that level of data from our contracted outreach teams.,175,,
1202,0.97,6626.553,6634.527,"We look at data from them, we are just getting a Snapshot of information for the referrals they make to shelter.",175,,
1203,0.97,6634.527,6641.434,We are not getting the every single direction that they make with an individual that finally gets them to say yes.,175,,
1204,0.97,6641.434,6650.577,So there is some the standardization in the kind of data that is collected.,175,,
1205,0.97,6650.577,6652.779,Much more scrutiny.,175,,
1206,0.97,6652.779,6656.549,And data expectation on the navigation team then is expected in the contracted providers.,175,,
1207,0.97,6656.549,6661.488,I want to restate that 60% is not a mandate.,175,,
1208,0.97,6661.488,6662.355,It is a target.,175,,
1209,0.97,6662.355,6664.391,A systemwide target.,175,,
1210,0.97,6664.391,6678.605,A target that was sort of facilitated by our home and facilitated by the public Funders across the region.,175,,
1211,0.97,6678.605,6686.479,"Also, on the standardization around outreach.",176,,
1212,0.97,6686.479,6700.56,"For my question, I just want to confirm, I thought I heard a statement that we are increasing the number of Yeses but I want to again go to attachment A. the total referrals under located have fallen.",176,,
1213,0.97,6700.56,6716.209,"And our rate of referral to shelter has Fallen., and the understanding that we don't know how accurate this data is, the rate and number of people arriving at shelters has fallen.",176,,
1214,0.97,6716.209,6730.657,So I think that is important context setting because we know there are things that can be done to actually improve the outcomes associated with outreach.,176,,
1215,0.97,6730.657,6751.344,"One of the things that the city auditor in October 2018 identified, raising the same concerns as they made a recommendation that the executive provide a plan for ensuring the navigation team compliance with outreach standards of care.",176,,
1216,0.97,6751.344,6753.279,It laid out five elements that would ensure compliance.,176,,
1217,0.97,6753.279,6759.252,Including determining which members of the navigation team would be required to adhere to those standards of care.,176,,
1218,0.97,6759.252,6764.09,"Identifying the compliance measures, how and when the data will be collected.",176,,
1219,0.97,6764.09,6768.161,Determining how the measures will be reviewed and evaluated.,176,,
1220,0.97,6768.161,6777.704,I it was also contacted last year I sent correspondence to you from CCS.,176,,
1221,0.97,6777.704,6804.097,"They also had the concern that when these standards of care are not adhered to, what the results often is it that it affects the likelihood that people who are being referred from the navigation team are less likely to be successful in Accessing permanent housing.",176,,
1222,0.97,6804.097,6806.533,So much of what happened as part of the standard of care.,176,,
1223,0.97,6806.533,6807.7,It helps outreach be successful.,176,,
1224,0.97,6807.7,6817.31,Not just the acceptance of outrage on the front and into permanent housing on the Essing Backend.,176,,
1225,0.97,6817.31,6832.559,"I know that there was, we had correspondence, director Johnson, about whether or not the standards of care that were referred to in the auditor's report for the standards that were all using right now.",176,,
1226,0.97,6832.559,6833.359,That we were Revisiting.,176,,
1227,0.97,6833.359,6839.465,But the principal is still an important possible.,176,,
1228,0.97,6839.465,6842.936,It is standardization for the out reach providers.,176,,
1229,0.97,6842.936,6848.641,The ones part of the navigation team.,176,,
1230,0.97,6848.641,6853.68,Can you let me know whether or not there has been any progress made on the auditors recommendation?,176,,
1231,0.97,6853.68,6864.09,How be could do better at monitoring the quality of outreach services and adherence to best practices?,176,,
1232,0.97,6864.09,6864.657,Thank you.,177,,
1233,0.97,6864.657,6873.566,We did address the outreach standards of care and our Q1 document.,177,,
1234,0.97,6873.566,6877.704,We will be happy to follow up with you again and provide market education.,177,,
1235,0.97,6877.704,6885.979,I do appreciate director Johnson highlighting the ways that the navigation team outreach works the same.,177,,
1236,0.97,6885.979,6888.448,We hold ourselves to the same standards as our other outreach providers.,177,,
1237,0.97,6888.448,6893.853,The navigation team meets weekly with members of the outreach continuum.,177,,
1238,0.97,6893.853,6905.131,"We have met and had other meetings with outreach, other outreach providers to talk about things like standards of care and goals for the work we do.",177,,
1239,0.97,6905.131,6922.949,"We all offer, if you look at the service request and the types of services offered, it is a core value of outreach work to meet the needs of the person in front of you with what they are asking for right in the moment.",177,,
1240,0.97,6922.949,6927.086,All outreach city funded work is including the navigation work.,177,,
1241,0.97,6927.086,6941.367,At the same time we are working towards a long goal of helping someone accept a safer alternative.,177,,
1242,0.97,6941.367,6943.469,"When we talk about, did you have a follow-up question?",177,,
1243,0.97,6943.469,6948.942,"For the viewing public, for folks who may not have all of the reports, you stated that the issue was addressed in the first quarter report.",178,,
1244,0.97,6948.942,6958.885,And it was addressed as far as a statement that makes clear that you did not incorporate standards of care into contracts with outreach agencies.,178,,
1245,0.97,6958.885,6962.155,"Differ, you did not monitor compliance with these standards.",178,,
1246,0.97,6962.155,6971.497,And you either could not or did not provide information on implementation and how it may very.,178,,
1247,0.97,6971.497,6976.97,We haven't received clarification for why the standards have not been formally incorporated into agency contracts.,178,,
1248,0.97,6976.97,6986.512,You said it was addressed but I think it is important for folks around this table on the viewing public to hear how it was addressed.,178,,
1249,0.97,6986.512,6995.221,The average standards of care were a set of recommendations that were made in 2016.,179,,
1250,0.97,6995.221,7012.805,"So while those were not ever formally built into contract expectations, those standards of care were built into our 2007 team Rfp process where we asked outreach providers to specifically respond to key elements.",179,,
1251,0.97,7012.805,7021.247,We build our program model around the core values of the outreach standards of care.,179,,
1252,0.97,7021.247,7024.917,That is in the attachment with our quarter one document.,179,,
1253,0.97,7024.917,7035.928,"So while they were not contractually mandated, they infused into the work of outreach providers, including the work of the navigation team.",179,,
1254,0.97,7035.928,7036.496,That work continues.,180,,
1255,0.97,7036.496,7053.146,"I will just add that not only did we infuse that in spirit, we made funding decisions based on the standards of care and people's ability to respond to their ability to adhere to those standards.",180,,
1256,0.97,7053.146,7056.983,The funding positions were made and that was at the center of decision-making for outreach programs.,181,,
1257,0.97,7056.983,7060.853,They have not been implemented or mandated into our contract.,181,,
1258,0.97,7060.853,7065.992,But it was a useful tool as to who we contract with.,181,,
1259,0.97,7065.992,7068.795,Can we continue to the end of the presentation.,182,,
1260,0.97,7068.795,7077.37,I want to get to the slide on diversion strategies.,183,,
1261,0.97,7077.37,7079.038,I have questions and want to hear more.,183,,
1262,0.97,7079.038,7084.21,"Before moving on, I would like to ask is a member Herbold if you have any questions?",184,,
1263,0.97,7084.21,7085.578,You can proceed with the presentation.,185,,
1264,0.97,7085.578,7086.078,Thank you.,186,,
1265,0.97,7086.078,7090.917,So we are excited to offer diversion on the navigation team as an important thing.,186,,
1266,0.97,7090.917,7095.922,You talk about outcomes for individuals.,187,,
1267,0.97,7095.922,7105.731,This is one way the navigation team and Hst has committed dollars behind improving outcomes for people who are living outdoors.,187,,
1268,0.97,7105.731,7113.272,As you know the centralized diversion fund was depleted in 2019.,187,,
1269,0.97,7113.272,7118.811,Diversion is a service that is very useful and helps individuals bypass the shelter system.,187,,
1270,0.97,7118.811,7125.651,It then helps us not have those bottlenecks of exits.,187,,
1271,0.97,7125.651,7134.06,"We are looking for how to help someone supports, support them with permanent or temporary housing solutions.",187,,
1272,0.97,7134.06,7137.263,So they don't have to.,187,,
1273,0.97,7137.263,7138.664,For the shelter.,187,,
1274,0.97,7138.664,7149.041,"To support diversion, a Hst has committed $12,000 in flexible funds so system navigators can work with individuals on diversion strategies.",187,,
1275,0.97,7149.041,7157.984,"In quarter one of 2020, we have had a couple of successful diversion outcomes already.",187,,
1276,0.97,7157.984,7163.122,So we are very pleased for that.,187,,
1277,0.97,7163.122,7166.092,But I'm curious also as to what questions you have specifically related to diversion.,187,,
1278,0.97,7166.092,7177.937,"It looks like, the amount of money that has been presented all day, every day, unless that is a Typo, that is not super flesh.",188,,
1279,0.97,7177.937,7178.504,The diversion account.,188,,
1280,0.97,7178.504,7186.812,But I am wondering if that is a proof of concept of wanting to see how this strategy can work with the allegation team.,188,,
1281,0.97,7186.812,7196.122,Like if there has been any evidence so far of how successful diversion based interventions have been with the Naff team.,188,,
1282,0.97,7196.122,7200.226,"To put my cards on the table, I am a huge supporter of diversion.",188,,
1283,0.97,7200.226,7210.803,"From a lot of the people I've talked to, marries place in particular, I am emphasizing the diversion.",188,,
1284,0.97,7210.803,7212.838,A bigger part of what they would like to offer.,188,,
1285,0.97,7212.838,7215.841,To have folks bypass the shelter system entirely.,188,,
1286,0.97,7215.841,7222.348,"But that $12,000 is not a lot to move the needle.",188,,
1287,0.97,7222.348,7224.75,"I am curious to see what the outcomes are of the $12,000.",188,,
1288,0.97,7224.75,7225.818,And the potential Scalability of that.,188,,
1289,0.97,7225.818,7236.195,"I want to wonder, is that something that will kick off in 2020 and you will have information later?",188,,
1290,0.97,7236.195,7237.363,So that is exactly right.,189,,
1291,0.97,7237.363,7243.869,That is not a great deal of money.,189,,
1292,0.97,7243.869,7244.136,"$12,000.",189,,
1293,0.97,7244.136,7258.884,"Diversion, diversion is the practice of engaging with an individual and exploring all options.",189,,
1294,0.97,7258.884,7260.219,It might be available to the individual.,189,,
1295,0.97,7260.219,7267.66,And we have seen great successes in our community with a version.,189,,
1296,0.97,7267.66,7270.062,Thank you for highlighting it works with a variety of populations.,189,,
1297,0.97,7270.062,7274.367,"Whether it is young people, families, individuals, who are experiencing homelessness as well as individuals who are on the verge of Eviction.",189,,
1298,0.97,7274.367,7278.204,So it is a proven model of case management engagement.,189,,
1299,0.97,7278.204,7291.083,Paired with oftentimes just a small amount of client assistance that has proven to be incredibly successful in Bypassing the shelter system altogether and moving into the housing.,189,,
1300,0.97,7291.083,7298.524,"What we want to do test out here is, could we put diversion resources into the hands of our system navigators?",189,,
1301,0.97,7298.524,7306.666,Could we train those system navigators in the Act of or process of diversion.,189,,
1302,0.97,7306.666,7314.073,So that they were well-trained and could engage in people and a divers matter with cash assistance.,189,,
1303,0.97,7314.073,7315.641,Let's see what kind of results we have.,189,,
1304,0.97,7315.641,7320.146,"So just to go back to Reemphasized part of my question, that answered most of it.",190,,
1305,0.97,7320.146,7333.459,"But the one piece of clarification that I did want was, if this is Forward-Looking or if we have experience on how the diversion money is helpful, it is this year.",190,,
1306,0.97,7333.459,7335.261,It is new.,191,,
1307,0.97,7335.261,7342.401,The diversion claim assistance Installers are something that we have here in 2020.,192,,
1308,0.97,7342.401,7342.768,Okay.,193,,
1309,0.97,7342.768,7359.852,"So just a flag for going forward, that is something that I particularly have a strong interest in and want to get more information on how those diversion uses go as we approach 2020.",193,,
1310,0.97,7359.852,7364.824,Looking at Scaling that up as one of our strategies because I have seen how it has worked well and a lot of other contacts.,193,,
1311,0.97,7364.824,7368.794,"If that is something that can make the mission of the navigation team more Impactful, like to for that more.",193,,
1312,0.97,7368.794,7370.396,Councilmember Mosqueda?,193,,
1313,0.97,7370.396,7374.5,That is all for now.,194,,
1314,0.97,7374.5,7376.368,"Take you, Mr. chair on the diversion funding.",195,,
1315,0.97,7376.368,7380.806,Is is not the same pool that Pearl jam provided funding to?,195,,
1316,0.97,7380.806,7392.284,And Microsoft is providing funding that is basically additional funds to cover one month's rent.,195,,
1317,0.97,7392.284,7392.785,Two months rent?,195,,
1318,0.97,7392.785,7393.586,That is correct.,196,,
1319,0.97,7393.586,7394.22,These are separate.,196,,
1320,0.97,7394.22,7398.691,These are in addition to the centralized diversion funds that were funded through both Pivate and public sources.,196,,
1321,0.97,7398.691,7412.705,So is related right in that we still would like some information about how many people were able to access the fund?,197,,
1322,0.97,7412.705,7413.839,What was the total universe there?,197,,
1323,0.97,7413.839,7418.744,My understanding is that the money that Pearl jam already provided was depleted already.,197,,
1324,0.97,7418.744,7419.745,Microsoft has added funds.,197,,
1325,0.97,7419.745,7424.75,Ideally we would not be in a situation where we as a municipality are looking for private contributions.,197,,
1326,0.97,7424.75,7430.156,But we appreciate that they are bringing the funding and.,197,,
1327,0.97,7430.156,7432.558,I would like to know more about how the fund has been used.,197,,
1328,0.97,7432.558,7433.159,Mr. chair?,197,,
1329,0.97,7433.159,7436.228,Do you mind if I ask a quick follow-up question?,197,,
1330,0.97,7436.228,7448.641,"So while director Johnson, you certainly answered my question.",198,,
1331,0.97,7448.641,7451.777,You have been answering my question about the 60% requirement rate for referrals.,199,,
1332,0.97,7451.777,7463.889,I had been under the impression that it was a requirement for our contractors and perhaps had changed in terms of the language we used with some of our contractors in the past.,199,,
1333,0.97,7463.889,7479.104,"But my understanding was that the way that our contractors see that 60% requirement for referrals and other agency contracts we have with referrals into housing, it is very much seen as an indicator of success.",199,,
1334,0.97,7479.104,7484.376,"While it my Nippy a mandate, it really does feel like this is a key indicator that they will be judged on in future years.",199,,
1335,0.97,7484.376,7494.92,Can you confirm for us that the 60% mark for referrals into shelter or referrals into housing is not how people are?,199,,
1336,0.97,7494.92,7497.59,Or is it an element that you look at for future funding?,200,,
1337,0.97,7497.59,7504.897,"So it is just to try to be as clear as possible, it is not a mandate.",201,,
1338,0.97,7504.897,7511.403,It is not our reach contract.,201,,
1339,0.97,7511.403,7512.638,They are not paid for performance.,201,,
1340,0.97,7512.638,7524.416,"We are not withholding any money based on an outreach program's ability to get close to, surpass, be far from the 60% target.",201,,
1341,0.97,7524.416,7542.668,"That said, as a system, so when the city of Seattle, all other cities in King County making County government, they look at how our system as a whole is performing, we are Gauging it against the targets that we have set.",201,,
1342,0.97,7542.668,7545.638,So we are talking about success.,201,,
1343,0.97,7545.638,7547.039,To Berkeley not of an individual program.,201,,
1344,0.97,7547.039,7552.478,But of a program type of investment area.,201,,
1345,0.97,7552.478,7557.483,To understand and engage where they are against the targets we set.,201,,
1346,0.97,7557.483,7562.988,And we set aggressive targets.,201,,
1347,0.97,7562.988,7568.494,They set high ambitious targets.,201,,
1348,0.97,7568.494,7569.094,We continue.,201,,
1349,0.97,7569.094,7571.497,The targets have been in place for 3 years.,201,,
1350,0.97,7571.497,7577.703,I believe they were established before 2018.,201,,
1351,0.97,7577.703,7593.018,"And those targets, programs, performance, percentage, it depends on what kind of program it is.",201,,
1352,0.97,7593.018,7595.12,Percentage of people Exiting into permanent housing.,201,,
1353,0.97,7595.12,7605.564,"Those of the kinds of performance, that is the kind of performance data that public Funders do use, including the human services Department to make funding decisions.",201,,
1354,0.97,7605.564,7612.938,So it is not necessarily are people surpassing the target.,201,,
1355,0.97,7612.938,7621.714,"But we do look across a program area, all of the programs when there is an Rfp.",201,,
1356,0.97,7621.714,7623.382,We look at how this programs are performing.,201,,
1357,0.97,7623.382,7626.618,", the member Mireles?",202,,
1358,0.97,7626.618,7631.657,I am going to try another way to see if we can get an answer to the question.,203,,
1359,0.97,7631.657,7635.928,So you said the contractors don't pay for performance.,204,,
1360,0.97,7635.928,7639.765,"So one question is, that is not what they are.",205,,
1361,0.97,7639.765,7640.165,What are they?,205,,
1362,0.97,7640.165,7644.036,Then you said that instead you set targets.,205,,
1363,0.97,7644.036,7651.777,"For what you would like to see, and then you see the targets are used as performance data for the contracts.",205,,
1364,0.97,7651.777,7656.448,So it sounds like they are used.,205,,
1365,0.97,7656.448,7656.849,Those targets.,205,,
1366,0.97,7656.849,7657.649,We use them.,206,,
1367,0.97,7657.649,7664.189,I would say it is not a pay for performance.,206,,
1368,0.97,7664.189,7665.791,We are not withholding money out of the contracts.,206,,
1369,0.97,7665.791,7668.594,It is not a mandate that you hit 60% or you don't get paid.,206,,
1370,0.97,7668.594,7670.029,We do use the targets systemwide.,206,,
1371,0.97,7670.029,7674.6,To understand how outreach investments made by the city of Seattle and King County are performing.,206,,
1372,0.97,7674.6,7679.805,That information will be used for future contracts.,207,,
1373,0.97,7679.805,7686.512,"So we use that in Rfps, HUD uses that.",208,,
1374,0.97,7686.512,7691.383,We rank how projects are performed.,208,,
1375,0.97,7691.383,7705.564,So we very much use those targets and use performance to understand how program areas are performing.,208,,
1376,0.97,7705.564,7709.501,Maybe it is better if I use an example.,208,,
1377,0.97,7709.501,7714.44,Rapid Rehousing was a brand-new intervention.,208,,
1378,0.97,7714.44,7716.475,People were really nervous about us investing in rapid Rehousing.,208,,
1379,0.97,7716.475,7721.747,We did early rapid Rehousing pilots.,208,,
1380,0.97,7721.747,7735.427,What we were able to see in this pilots is that they performed well meaning that people remained in permanent housing and that the relative cost of that permanent housing exit was relatively low.,208,,
1381,0.97,7735.427,7748.24,So we weren't looking at any one individual program but we were looking across the entire system to say you know what?,208,,
1382,0.97,7748.24,7749.875,Investment in rapid Rehousing seem to be successful.,208,,
1383,0.97,7749.875,7751.577,We do the same thing across outreach.,209,,
1384,0.97,7751.577,7754.413,"Across emergency basic shelter, enhanced shelter, transitional housing, come and supportive housing.",209,,
1385,0.97,7754.413,7766.391,"So it is, those targets help us give a target indicator as to how well the system of advancements are performing.",209,,
1386,0.97,7766.391,7771.296,"Thank you, council member Peterson.",210,,
1387,0.97,7771.296,7771.797,Do you have a question?,210,,
1388,0.97,7771.797,7772.064,Yes.,211,,
1389,0.97,7772.064,7772.431,Thank you.,212,,
1390,0.97,7772.431,7775.3,Thank you for being here today.,213,,
1391,0.97,7775.3,7779.004,There are lots of tough questions.,213,,
1392,0.97,7779.004,7780.105,People want to solve the Prom.,213,,
1393,0.97,7780.105,7783.208,We are all in this work to engage together.,213,,
1394,0.97,7783.208,7784.643,Trying to make the system better.,213,,
1395,0.97,7784.643,7793.519,"And one of my first, the first thing I did on my first day on the job was actually a company's the navigation team was engaging with.",213,,
1396,0.97,7793.519,7799.224,People were experiencing homelessness.,213,,
1397,0.97,7799.224,7806.198,"What I observed were professionals, city employees, highly professional people trying to do their best under the difficult circumstances.",213,,
1398,0.97,7806.198,7812.838,The people living outside.,213,,
1399,0.97,7812.838,7819.344,I just appreciate the hard work you are trying to do and thank you for the work.,213,,
1400,0.97,7819.344,7820.946,I know you don't hear that enough.,213,,
1401,0.97,7820.946,7834.359,"In terms of the new, as you try to improve the program, to the Councilmembers who are pushing in that direction.",213,,
1402,0.97,7834.359,7847.139,"Defining obstructions, this new element of you being able to transport people now from the unauthorized and Chemnitz to shelters, that is a very new element.",213,,
1403,0.97,7847.139,7851.877,I remember you were thinking about that I can November of last.,213,,
1404,0.97,7851.877,7857.182,"Tell us about, when did that start?",213,,
1405,0.97,7857.182,7859.551,When do you expect to see results from the transportation division?,213,,
1406,0.97,7859.551,7863.889,"That began in late Q4, 2019.",214,,
1407,0.97,7863.889,7874.199,We continue to critique supports from the system navigators as to how that is having a real benefit.,214,,
1408,0.97,7874.199,7875.801,I am fortunate to receive their narrative.,214,,
1409,0.97,7875.801,7885.31,"Some narrative stories, about really the details about how the ways transportation has been Transformative and helping people access shelter.",214,,
1410,0.97,7885.31,7889.715,"Similar to diversion, I have been able to read the personal accounts from our system navigators.",214,,
1411,0.97,7889.715,7896.121,Of those also.,214,,
1412,0.97,7896.121,7897.256,We didn't bring those things today.,214,,
1413,0.97,7897.256,7898.69,Some do have personally identifying information.,214,,
1414,0.97,7898.69,7904.83,"But I know for our system of Gators, it really is of value for them to be able to help take that person the next step.",214,,
1415,0.97,7904.83,7906.431,On the journey.,214,,
1416,0.97,7906.431,7918.644,"And that diversion funding, a lot of us support and have seen it work with other providers.",215,,
1417,0.97,7918.644,7920.912,"So that is, like you said, that is new as well.",215,,
1418,0.97,7920.912,7930.055,This idea of empowering the system navigators with some dollars to help solve problems for people in the field.,215,,
1419,0.97,7930.055,7932.09,"That is, you are saying that just started this quarter.",215,,
1420,0.97,7932.09,7933.258,That started this quarter.,216,,
1421,0.97,7933.258,7940.299,I appreciate Dr. Johnson highlighting for all of us that it is not just a financial investment.,216,,
1422,0.97,7940.299,7942.634,Diversion is a way of doing work.,216,,
1423,0.97,7942.634,7957.349,"A conversation and oftentimes a very small dollar, client assistant dollars can have a successful diversion because it's about the broader Problem- solving within the Visuals.",216,,
1424,0.97,7957.349,7961.053,We will look forward to seeing how the outcomes are but these new elements of transportation and diversion.,217,,
1425,0.97,7961.053,7970.462,You mentioned earlier about the idea you have.,217,,
1426,0.97,7970.462,7972.364,Do you have access to the homeless management information system?,217,,
1427,0.97,7972.364,7975.567,Is that where you are getting the data for when people are going to the shelters?,217,,
1428,0.97,7975.567,7977.569,Or is that the data you don't have access to?,217,,
1429,0.97,7977.569,7981.206,Hst has access to each MIS information.,218,,
1430,0.97,7981.206,7992.818,"What we call internally a match back process, where we are pulling data from all of our navigation Apps, the referral we have made.",218,,
1431,0.97,7992.818,7997.322,The unique referrals and Cross- Referencing that to the Hmi s system.,218,,
1432,0.97,7997.322,8002.327,That's where we can get the advantages of privacy.,218,,
1433,0.97,8002.327,8009.034,It makes it hard for us to do the match back but it is the Hmi s and the Naff teams navigation Database.,218,,
1434,0.97,8009.034,8014.94,That is know if there's something that is needed to make those more accurate.,219,,
1435,0.97,8014.94,8016.341,Maybe the numbers will change.,219,,
1436,0.97,8016.341,8020.445,We are seeking accuracy with the data.,219,,
1437,0.97,8020.445,8021.847,We want to be helpful with that.,219,,
1438,0.97,8021.847,8028.687,"So in terms of the obstruction definition, I mean, we approach things differently.",219,,
1439,0.97,8028.687,8035.36,That is why the Council can be so strong.,219,,
1440,0.97,8035.36,8041.133,"The definition of obstruction, it sounds like it is a common theme we would like to get more information on.",219,,
1441,0.97,8041.133,8043.969,And see how that is defined.,219,,
1442,0.97,8043.969,8053.745,"So we can see, is there consensus on what is a reasonable, what is reasonably defined as aid obstruction.",219,,
1443,0.97,8053.745,8061.453,"It seems that there are fewer safeguards in terms of how the notification occurs, etc.",219,,
1444,0.97,8061.453,8065.49,I look forward to hearing more about that.,219,,
1445,0.97,8065.49,8066.358,Thank you so much.,219,,
1446,0.97,8066.358,8073.932,"I know a number of Council members have more appointments so at this point, I would like to adjourn this council meeting.",220,,
1447,0.97,8073.932,8079.704,I want to make a couple of closing remarks and kind of in my word map before I would like to go with us.,220,,
1448,0.97,8079.704,8084.109,We can follow these conversations off-line.,220,,
1449,0.97,8084.109,8094.753,"First, from the conversation we had earlier, I think I see two big systemic issues that we should work through and that I would like to work through with the Department in Councilmembers.",220,,
1450,0.97,8094.753,8104.93,I think the first one is that the very high decline rate for referrals and really drilling down into what the basis is for that high decline rate.,220,,
1451,0.97,8104.93,8109.334,What it is about our particular strategy and using the navigation team that is resulting in folks fusing services.,220,,
1452,0.97,8109.334,8109.568,Or not.,220,,
1453,0.97,8109.568,8111.036,Engaging with the navigation team.,220,,
1454,0.97,8111.036,8119.811,I want to look at the relation that that has to the supply of transitional Encampments and enhanced shelters.,220,,
1455,0.97,8119.811,8124.249,There was a conversation earlier when we were talking about that issue.,220,,
1456,0.97,8124.249,8132.357,Where I believe director Johnson said it would move the bottleneck to being at the front door of housing.,220,,
1457,0.97,8132.357,8146.571,"My analysis from the conversation today is the bottleneck is currently in Unsanctioned Encampments in our neighborhoods, parks, the areas that the cancer being cleared.",220,,
1458,0.97,8146.571,8149.975,Moving the bottleneck to transitional and Chemnitz would be a huge step in the right direction.,220,,
1459,0.97,8149.975,8155.347,So those are my two big Takeaways from the conversation.,220,,
1460,0.97,8155.347,8157.983,I really appreciate everyone coming and being prepared to answer difficult questions today.,220,,
1461,0.97,8157.983,8161.72,Really look forward to continuing this conversation and I want to thank everyone for their patience on the committee.,220,,
1462,0.97,8161.72,8166.691,"With that, before we adjourn, is there any other business?",220,,
1463,0.97,8166.691,8167.692,There doesn't appear to be.,220,,
1464,0.97,8167.692,8169.928,"To hearing know for the business, we are hereby adjourned.",220,,
1465,0.97,8169.928,8180.171,Thank you so much.,220,,
