589,0.8803859949111938,3004.3,3004.8,I'm sorry.,,,
590,0.8803859949111938,3004.8,3005.9,I forgot the other one.,,,
591,0.8991211652755737,3008.9,3018.1," So I'm just trying to think, what does it mean to fund this option for people to assure people that they will have right to counsel?",,,
592,0.8991211652755737,3018.1,3020.3,"Given that there are that many cases here, which I have to say.",,,
593,0.8991211652755737,3020.3,3023.9,"That's a lot more than I expected you to say, so thank you for that information.",,,
594,0.8991211652755737,3024.4,3025.1,You are.,,,
595,0.8991211652755737,3025.1,3028.5,"Yes, and thanks for the refresher at this point.",,,
596,0.8991211652755737,3028.5,3038.2,"The estimate is about 750,000 dollars annually, to be able to have the housing Justice project staff that many",,,
597,0.8932262063026428,3038.5,3044.5," Evictions, obviously, this year's estimate is a little different because of the moratorium currently.",,,
598,0.8932262063026428,3044.5,3051.5,I believe we are funding them at a six and six hundred and five thousand dollars.,,,
599,0.8932262063026428,3051.5,3055.3,And so that is the contract for 2021.,,,
600,0.8932262063026428,3055.3,3062.3,"So depending on if and when the moratorium ends, that might require adding more funds to get us up to the 750,000.",,,
601,0.8932262063026428,3062.3,3066.1,"But again, that will depend primarily on the the timing of the moratorium.",,,
602,0.8568393588066101,3070.5,3070.8, Thank you.,,,
603,0.8568393588066101,3071.2,3076.5,"And so, yeah, that would have allowed that those 1,200 estimated 1,200.",,,
604,0.8568393588066101,3076.5,3080.0,People would have somebody with them as they're going through the process.,,,
605,0.8568393588066101,3080.4,3080.8,Thank you.,,,
606,0.8568393588066101,3081.5,3089.0,"And and actually, after Ali comes and I would also invite maybe Edmund.",,,
607,0.8568393588066101,3089.0,3093.3,"I mean, all panelists are, of course, welcome to speak to these questions is a very important questions.",,,
608,0.8568393588066101,3093.3,3100.0,"But if Edmund from the experience of the housing, Justice project also wanted to speak is these are attorneys who have",,,
609,0.9027422070503235,3100.2,3110.7, Filipinos Georgetown experience with tenants experiencing eviction and what what a decisive difference it makes having trained legal representation.,,,
610,0.9027422070503235,3110.7,3112.0,I think that would also be useful.,,,
611,0.9027422070503235,3112.5,3113.2,Go ahead Ali.,,,
612,0.9027422070503235,3113.4,3114.8,Thank you Captain.,,,
613,0.9027422070503235,3114.8,3116.5,I thought I don't have anything to add to it.,,,
614,0.9027422070503235,3116.6,3118.0,Asha presented.,,,
615,0.9027422070503235,3118.3,3118.8,Thanks.,,,
616,0.9027422070503235,3118.9,3119.7,Okay.,,,
617,0.9027422070503235,3119.7,3120.9,Thank you Edmund.,,,
618,0.9027422070503235,3120.9,3121.7,Did you want to speak to this?,,,
619,0.9027422070503235,3122.0,3125.7,"Yeah, and thank you for first of all, taking this on.",,,
620,0.9027422070503235,3125.7,3127.6,"I think this is a really important issue, and I wanted to correct.",,,
621,0.9027422070503235,3127.6,3129.5,One thing or contract with the city is about.,,,
622,0.8804855346679688,3130.2,3135.4," Thousand actually this year, not 601 thing is that just answer the question.",,,
623,0.8804855346679688,3135.4,3142.4,We actually don't really know the scope of this problem because that's 500 number is how many filed evictions occurred.,,,
624,0.8804855346679688,3142.7,3147.7,"Washington is unique in that it doesn't have a court case, good filed until really late.",,,
625,0.8804855346679688,3148.2,3153.4,And so when you compare us to another state it looks like our numbers might be significant significantly lower.,,,
626,0.8804855346679688,3153.7,3159.9,"But if you go to a place like Maryland, for example, well, Maryland, the landlord can't even demand rent without filing something in.",,,
627,0.872313916683197,3160.8,3162.4," So there is all is, when you look at Baltimore.",,,
628,0.872313916683197,3162.4,3164.6,"They have 160,000 rent.",,,
629,0.872313916683197,3164.6,3170.3,"The man's effectively filed in their court, that then kind of trickled down into a certain number of evictions.",,,
630,0.872313916683197,3170.7,3174.1,We don't know how many tenants fall behind on their rent every month.,,,
631,0.872313916683197,3174.1,3178.7,We don't know how many landlords ask them to leave and that's the sort of the big unknown.,,,
632,0.872313916683197,3178.7,3183.1,I would say when we look at our internal numbers of like how many people that we don't include?,,,
633,0.872313916683197,3183.1,3186.3,"Just the file cases, what we look at, how many people came to us with a rental problem.",,,
634,0.872313916683197,3186.3,3189.3,"It starts approaching about 3,000 in Seattle.",,,
635,0.848939061164856,3190.2,3192.8, And that number again is just the people who come to us.,,,
636,0.848939061164856,3192.8,3194.5,So I don't know how many people are out there.,,,
637,0.848939061164856,3194.5,3199.7,"Also who have go to other organizations, go to other legal services or don't really go to anyone.",,,
638,0.848939061164856,3200.2,3208.7,"And I think the other big problem that we have ultimately in this is, how do we work with a lot of people who don't show up the court, which is always been the biggest problem.",,,
639,0.848939061164856,3208.7,3213.1,"I think the most vulnerable members we have, are the ones who don't show up to our services.",,,
640,0.848939061164856,3213.1,3215.3,Don't have contact with other organizations.,,,
641,0.848939061164856,3215.7,3218.0,And those are the people who have a language barrier.,,,
642,0.848939061164856,3218.2,3220.1,Those are the the tenants who are struggling.,,,
643,0.8545472025871277,3220.2,3224.3," Disability, who the first person who actually is the point of contact.",,,
644,0.8545472025871277,3224.3,3227.7,"Unfortunately, is usually the King County Sheriff, when they come there to a victim.",,,
645,0.8545472025871277,3228.3,3237.7,"And I think a lot of the big kind of Crux of all of this is like, this is sort of, I think is really feeding into a lot of our homelessness crisis right now.",,,
646,0.8545472025871277,3238.1,3246.6,"And when you think about just our numbers, there's about 11 thousand homeless persons on any given night generally, but we have a county of two million people.",,,
647,0.8545472025871277,3246.6,3250.0,"I mean that's that's not a ton of people, but we know how visible it is.",,,
648,0.8484741449356079,3250.2,3251.3, We know what a crisis is.,,,
649,0.8484741449356079,3251.3,3262.9,"In fact is it's just actually, it doesn't take a lot of people to be homeless for it to be very visible in your community and to have all of the other problems that come with that and to have basically the crisis and emergency that we've been in.",,,
650,0.8484741449356079,3263.3,3275.3,"So, even if you have 1200 people or you have been a fraction of that, just adding a thousands of people to that number is going to cause even bigger crisis, especially now, it doesn't take a million people to make a crisis.",,,
651,0.8484741449356079,3275.3,3278.9,It actually just takes a couple thousand or even less than that at this point.,,,
652,0.8484741449356079,3278.9,3280.0,This is why this is so,,,
653,0.764024019241333,3280.2,3281.6, Radical right here.,,,
654,0.764024019241333,3281.6,3289.4,"And I think when we did that report and losing home a couple of years ago with the Seattle women's commission, part of, it was just to shine a light on what was going on.",,,
655,0.764024019241333,3289.5,3291.4,There was a fiction that were happening for $10.,,,
656,0.764024019241333,3291.4,3300.5,We had tenants who would show up on the homelessness desk after they were evicted and really nobody's really counting on following up with those Trends to find out where they're going.,,,
657,0.764024019241333,3301.0,3310.1,"And I think it's ultimately, there's a lot of mental health issues that are going on, the dress that are basically being seen in that court and that court is not prepared to handle and there's also just a lot of",,,
658,0.7613250017166138,3310.2,3311.6, People who are losing their homes.,,,
659,0.7613250017166138,3311.6,3315.7,"For very little bits about amounts of money in the area, and that is a crisis.",,,
660,0.7613250017166138,3315.7,3317.6,And it's going to cause further problems.,,,

754,0.8815181851387024,3917.7,3921.7,San Francisco Boulder and and Baltimore have no income on it for their right to counsel.,,,
755,0.8815181851387024,3921.7,3932.0,"And Cleveland's 100% was the result of a long and protracted battle with the city council where ultimately, they were not really willing to go any further at least initially.",,,

757,0.8815181851387024,3933.3,3935.5,Not only is 100% income fresh.,,,
758,0.8971533179283142,3935.6,3938.4, But also requires the family to have children in order to be covered.,,,
759,0.8971533179283142,3938.4,3942.9,"So it is a much, much more limited right to counsel than what exists in pretty much.",,,

762,0.7837850451469421,3966.5,3974.3," And it found that 85 percent of those who had gotten Council were extremely low or low income 9%, were moderate income and only 6% were both moderate.",,,

765,0.7837850451469421,3983.2,3988.6,"And I think that's, you know, ultimately, what generally happens when you have a right to counsel regardless of the income limit or not.",,,
766,0.9001506567001343,3992.1,3998.2, I will second way John said and I think also councilmembers salons comments and I think absolutely Reese.,,,

773,0.9001506567001343,4021.6,4022.1,I've never seen,,,
774,0.8977234363555908,4022.1,4025.4, That it's a lot of times when people are struggling with addictions.,,,
775,0.8977234363555908,4025.4,4026.3,It's because of poverty.,,,
776,0.8977234363555908,4026.3,4027.9,It's because of those struggles.,,,
777,0.8977234363555908,4027.9,4046.6,"And so, in my experience, when we've had, we do technically, some type of means testing as it is, but it's mostly just a grant to comply with various grants, but the reality is we almost never ever have to turn anybody away and it's pretty rare that we get somebody who actually does fall above that 200% of federal poverty line that we generally use.",,,
778,0.8977234363555908,4046.6,4052.0,"Sometimes we'll just taken to other exceptions to that, but the route is like eviction like 90% of them.",,,

780,0.7374980449676514,4060.4,4070.7,I would suggest like avoiding trying to happy in sesame the best you can because it can have a pretty negative affect and ultimately stall out and I think it's really ultimately not something that's needed it.,,,

857,0.8526685237884521,4498.0,4502.3,And now we have this new strain and the CDC is estimating that within three months.,,,
858,0.8526685237884521,4502.6,4504.8,It's going to be the dominant strain in the nation.,,,
859,0.8891938924789429,4506.4,4508.1, And the eviction moratorium.,,,
860,0.8891938924789429,4508.1,4510.5,It's going to be really bad.,,,
861,0.8891938924789429,4510.9,4512.7,It's already really bad.,,,
862,0.8891938924789429,4512.7,4513.8,Right?,,,
863,0.8891938924789429,4513.8,4514.4,And Ariana.,,,
864,0.8891938924789429,4514.4,4519.0,I think you made an important point that a lot of the people who are newly becoming vulnerable.,,,
865,0.8891938924789429,4519.0,4521.9,It's because of the economic crisis and covid.,,,
866,0.8891938924789429,4521.9,4527.3,"People who used to have jobs, who are now unemployed, or underemployed and, and am I right?",,,
867,0.8891938924789429,4527.3,4533.5,In understanding Ariana that you used to be a UFC w21 shop steward at PCC.,,,
868,0.8891938924789429,4533.7,4534.6,Yes.,,,
869,0.8459716439247131,4535.8,4537.5," And I think yes, go ahead.",,,

878,0.9056820273399353,4575.5,4603.1,"Thank you for adding that Ariana for giving the also a national Nationwide perspective, on what what's happening to grocery store workers and you know the UFCW membership and and obviously having the union is crucial but it's also a massive crisis that grocery store workers are shouldering, you know, the by themselves along with other Frontline workers, and I think it's important to know, I think it's important you brought this up because the renter crisis doesn't exist by",,,
879,0.8837888836860657,4603.3,4604.6," So, somewhere else in the universe.",,,
880,0.8837888836860657,4604.6,4605.7,These are our workers.,,,
881,0.8837888836860657,4605.7,4619.2,"These are people who are keeping the rest of us safe, because we are able to do stay at home, but they aren't, and they are also facing the renter crisis the in, and that it's for its for them that we're fighting for the eviction moratorium.",,,
882,0.8837888836860657,4619.2,4625.3,So that was a very valuable point of view that you brought in and I know other panels.,,,

894,0.9093577265739441,4664.6,4670.9,"So, it's a pleasure to be here and I'm really pleased that Seattle is considering this legislation.",,,
895,0.9093577265739441,4672.2,4675.5,We really are seeing an incredible glance Groundswell around this issue.,,,
896,0.9093577265739441,4675.5,4676.3,My organization.,,,
897,0.9093577265739441,4676.3,4680.6,The National Coalition for civil right to counsel has been involved in all of the successful campaign.,,,
898,0.9093577265739441,4680.6,4682.2,So far that have established a right?,,,
899,0.9093577265739441,4682.2,4688.5,And I'm just going to talk for just a minute or two about why we do this and then talk about what's actually happening.,,,
900,0.9093577265739441,4688.5,4689.0,But basically,,,
901,0.9018914103507996,4689.7,4698.5," Like, when we talk about the downstream consequences eviction, like, basically, the first thing to say is like, everything is a consequence of eviction, be all of your basic human needs.",,,
902,0.9018914103507996,4698.5,4710.8,"Can basically be implemented whether it's access to your children schools, homelessness, your physical Liberty, by being arrested employment, loss health effects neighborhood effects, your neighborhood being commute, you know, devastated.",,,
903,0.9018914103507996,4710.8,4712.2,These are not theoretical.,,,
904,0.9018914103507996,4712.2,4714.2,"These are all been, studied by social scientists.",,,
905,0.9018914103507996,4714.2,4718.1,There's data demonstrating it all of these impacts happen as a result of evictions.,,,
906,0.9018914103507996,4718.1,4719.7,"And then of course, there's",,,
907,0.8005647659301758,4719.9,4722.6, State county and City Revenue loss from these consequences.,,,
908,0.8005647659301758,4722.6,4723.3,Potentially.,,,
909,0.8005647659301758,4724.0,4729.6,"This is an estimate that was done, nationally of the cost of evictions across the country and it's about 315 billion dollars.",,,
910,0.8005647659301758,4729.6,4732.6,That's what evictions cost us is a country through all of these.,,,
911,0.8005647659301758,4732.9,4744.3,"These costs that are that are Quantified on this particular slide and then during covid, we have additional consequences which are that basically evictions cause people to double up increases the spread of infection.",,,
912,0.8005647659301758,4744.3,4749.5,"And basically, that's why the CDC said, we need to have a moratorium because we cannot have people",,,
913,0.905627965927124,4749.7,4750.6, We're being evicted right now.,,,
914,0.905627965927124,4750.6,4757.4,It's too dangerous and both unsheltered homelessness and doubling up are greatly contributing to spreading covid.,,,
915,0.905627965927124,4757.4,4765.1,This is not also theoretical there have been studies done by academics in the last few months that have demonstrated and Quantified.,,,
916,0.905627965927124,4765.1,4770.2,Exactly how much eviction 'z actually spread that this the the prevalence of covid-19.,,,
917,0.905627965927124,4770.2,4777.2,"And I've also looked at exactly how much mortality it causes that, it's not theoretical that kills, people that are fictions kill people.",,,
918,0.905627965927124,4777.2,4779.4,They've actually looked at how an increase in the eviction made.,,,
919,0.9051449298858643,4779.6,4784.2," Leads to a certain number of deaths, which is when it when you see it, portrayed that starkly.",,,
920,0.9051449298858643,4784.2,4786.3,It really shows you exactly what we're talking about here.,,,
921,0.9051449298858643,4786.5,4790.7,There are also covid itself has created just a morass of legal issues.,,,
922,0.9051449298858643,4790.7,4794.5,The federal moratorium has a has a number of issues legally.,,,
923,0.9051449298858643,4794.5,4796.6,It has exceptions and has limitations.,,,
924,0.9051449298858643,4797.2,4802.9,It has some things that are subject to interpretation landlords are pressing legal claims in court.,,,
925,0.9051449298858643,4802.9,4805.3,The tenants do not know how to defend related to the moratorium.,,,
926,0.9051449298858643,4805.3,4807.6,The moratorium is constantly changing.,,,
927,0.9051449298858643,4807.6,4809.3,We expect actually the CDC moratorium.,,,
928,0.8926994204521179,4809.7,4812.6," Time to change soon its parameters to change soon, hopefully to get better.",,,
929,0.8926994204521179,4812.6,4833.5,"But that again will lead to another round of legal questions that come up the moratorium nature and far as what they cover constantly changes in Washington state, where sometimes you've had city and county and state level moratorium at the same time, expecting a tenant to know what protections apply to them or even actually expecting the courts to understand what law applies at.",,,
930,0.8926994204521179,4833.5,4835.3,"The moment, is really asking too much.",,,
931,0.8926994204521179,4835.7,4839.2,This is really the domain of tenant attorneys to keep up with this sort of thing.,,,
932,0.9050333499908447,4839.8,4845.7," And then when courts are holding hearings, the in-person hearings are fraught with due process problems.",,,
933,0.9050333499908447,4845.7,4849.0,They a lot of tenants don't have access to the technology to use them.,,,
934,0.9050333499908447,4849.0,4851.5,They don't know how to introduce evidence on Zoom.,,,
935,0.9050333499908447,4851.9,4853.8,The courts have problems with dropped connections.,,,
936,0.9050333499908447,4853.8,4857.8,And then when they hold hearings in person that goes back to the original problem.,,,
937,0.9050333499908447,4857.8,4861.5,"We were trying to avoid in the first place, which is concentrating people in a small indoor space.",,,
938,0.9050333499908447,4861.5,4869.7,"So either way whether it's in this goes to, I think the councilwoman's point about the moratorium eviction should not be happening right now, right to counsel, and",,,
939,0.8957829475402832,4869.8,4873.2, As the secondary to the fact that the court shouldn't be open at all.,,,
940,0.8957829475402832,4873.2,4888.4,"Although even if they were not open, even if there was a complete moratorium, you would still need a right to counsel because landlords simply file illegal evictions or not file, but they take illegal illegal eviction activity by locking people out turning off their water and power, and so on.",,,
941,0.8957829475402832,4888.4,4890.3,"And so, you still need counsel to deal with.",,,
942,0.8957829475402832,4890.3,4892.8,Even the situations that happen outside of the courtroom.,,,
943,0.8957829475402832,4893.0,4899.6,"You've already heard statistics specific to Seattle and Washington about race, but, you know, these are National statistics about how much more this",,,
944,0.8862931132316589,4899.8,4910.7," Impacts communities of color and this data from the Census really just shows how often, you know, with the top being black tenants in the bottom being white, tenants, How likely they are to say, they're not able to pay rent.",,,
945,0.8862931132316589,4910.7,4917.3,"The red bars are basically unlikely to pay rent and you can see those bars for black, tenants nationally or twice as high as they are for white tenants.",,,
946,0.8862931132316589,4917.3,4922.0,"So this is covid has really made things which were already inequitable, even seriously worse.",,,
947,0.8862931132316589,4922.0,4923.9,"So where we are right now, on?",,,
948,0.8862931132316589,4923.9,4928.3,"Right to counsel is we're seeing, you know, really the cresting of this movement.",,,
949,0.8763447403907776,4930.0,4934.0," We have seven jurisdictions, which had passed it, which we already talked about.",,,
950,0.8763447403907776,4934.2,4935.4,And this year alone.,,,
951,0.8763447403907776,4935.4,4945.5,We have five states already that have introduced Statewide legislation including Washington state where there was a hearing last week some of these bills we actually have a real chance of passing this year.,,,
952,0.8763447403907776,4946.0,4948.0,So we're really excited about that.,,,
953,0.8763447403907776,4948.2,4958.4,"There's also a city level activity and there's Federal, there have been Federal bills filed by a number of members of the House and Senate, we expect more of those bills to happen in 2021.",,,
954,0.8763447403907776,4958.4,4959.5,So there's really a lot of,,,
955,0.8599726557731628,4959.8,4962.4, twist from the government entities on doing this.,,,
956,0.8599726557731628,4963.7,4975.0,We don't really have time to compare all of the elements of these different bills that you heard earlier that the eligibility requirements do very they go everywhere from 100% of federal poverty level to knowing can limit at all.,,,
957,0.8599726557731628,4975.6,4988.6,"Some of them, cover subsidized, tenant terminations, which in our view is essential because if someone's voucher is terminated, that's basically if as that is an eviction because without the voucher, they will not be able to stay in their unit.",,,
958,0.8599726557731628,4988.6,4989.6,So those are,,,
959,0.8595440983772278,4989.8,4992.1," From our perspective, subsidy terminations are evictions.",,,
960,0.8595440983772278,4992.1,4993.4,They need to be covered as well.,,,
961,0.8595440983772278,4994.1,4998.1,They cover different things as far as the peels in Baltimore.,,,
962,0.8595440983772278,4998.1,5005.1,"Actually the bill covers evictions in termination of subsidies or a proceeding that's considered quote, functionally equivalent as determined by the provider.",,,
963,0.8595440983772278,5005.1,5014.8,So that's even broader definition and you can see some of these were done by ballot some of them by City And the revenue sources generally Revenue generally are done through General Revenue.,,,
964,0.8595440983772278,5014.8,5017.0,Although few places have done other things.,,,
965,0.8595440983772278,5017.6,5019.0,The tax that was done in bulk.,,,
966,0.8595440983772278,5019.0,5019.6,Boulder was a,,,
967,0.9003809690475464,5019.7,5023.9," Actually required by state law, they have a state law that that does not allow a ballot initiative.",,,
968,0.9003809690475464,5023.9,5027.4,That does not create a new source of Revenue if it has a revenue impact.,,,
969,0.9003809690475464,5027.4,5029.9,So they had to do it that way.,,,
970,0.9003809690475464,5030.2,5038.5,"And as you can see, also the how, how long these are rolled out by and who is, you know, responsible for overseeing is dramatically different from City to City.",,,
971,0.9003809690475464,5038.6,5047.8,"There's no kind of one standard tremendous success already from the places that we've seen having a right to counsel 86% of tenants, are staying in their homes in New York City.",,,
972,0.9003809690475464,5047.8,5049.2,That's just a staggering statistic.,,,
973,0.9055365920066833,5049.8,5061.1," The statistic I like almost as much as the fact that evictions of file eviction filings have dropped by 30%, That is quite frankly because landlords have seen that, if they file something that's frivolous.",,,
974,0.9055365920066833,5061.1,5062.6,It will be met by an attorney.,,,
975,0.9055365920066833,5062.6,5065.1,It's not theoretical that they will be met by an attorney.,,,
976,0.9055365920066833,5065.1,5069.2,They can't file something that is just entirely illegal or wrongful or frivolous.,,,
977,0.9055365920066833,5069.2,5076.3,"So we expected that drop, but it's still gratifying to see it and default judgments have also dropped.",,,
978,0.9055365920066833,5076.3,5077.9,"You heard a lot about default, judgments.",,,
979,0.9055365920066833,5077.9,5079.7,A default judgment rate has dropped by 34%.,,,
980,0.9034913182258606,5079.9,5086.6," And in New York, so that's really you know, we're the results have come very fast and really are proof of the concept of right to counsel.",,,
981,0.9034913182258606,5086.6,5093.7,"What we're also really excited about is the judge is the housing court, judges in New York City have said, this is not making their jobs harder.",,,
982,0.9034913182258606,5093.7,5097.4,It actually is improving efficiency and fairness from their perspective.,,,
983,0.9034913182258606,5097.4,5099.9,That the housing court judges are supportive of the right to counsel.,,,
984,0.9034913182258606,5100.4,5109.4,"Now that they've seen what it was, they were apprehensive a little before it passed, but now that it is past they've testified in favor of it San Francisco, which has been around a lot shorter.",,,
985,0.9034913182258606,5109.4,5109.7,It's,,,
986,0.7982577085494995,5109.8,5117.2," only been in effect for a year, has already seen a 10% filing decrease and about two-thirds of the tenants are staying at their homes.",,,
987,0.7982577085494995,5117.2,5119.2,"So really, we're seeing the results.",,,
988,0.7982577085494995,5119.2,5124.5,These San Francisco and New York were the only two jurisdictions that have been implemented long enough to actually have data.,,,
989,0.7982577085494995,5124.8,5132.6,"So we don't have data yet from the other jurisdictions, but as we get that we'll share that, it's also really great to know that the spray.",,,

1075,0.8705607056617737,5539.5,5544.9,"I think the last thing I really just want to add is kind of, what kind of give you a sense of what actually we do.",,,
1076,0.8705607056617737,5545.2,5549.1,"And, you know, I think the best way to sort of frame it as a little bit of a quick anecdote.",,,
1077,0.8705607056617737,5549.2,5550.6,I had a client recently.,,,
1078,0.8705607056617737,5550.6,5551.9,It was out in West Seattle.,,,
1079,0.8705607056617737,5551.9,5555.4,"She was not really woman who's being a victim from affordable, housing unit.",,,
1080,0.8705607056617737,5555.7,5563.4,"She had been, I've been put in contact with her by her case manager and I didn't know anything about her and I started making calling her.",,,
1081,0.8705607056617737,5563.4,5564.9,And then I eventually found a,,,
1082,0.8352134227752686,5565.0,5567.3," Unable to meet me anywhere, understand what was going on.",,,
1083,0.8352134227752686,5567.3,5577.4,"So I would go to her home and talked with her and I got went there a couple times to get her to sign a couple papers, explain things, everything seemed fine.",,,
1084,0.8352134227752686,5578.0,5579.4,And then I touched one of her case.,,,
1085,0.8352134227752686,5579.4,5585.0,"Managers, who told me that she had was describing.",,,
1086,0.8352134227752686,5585.0,5589.8,"There was a man in a suit who kept coming around to her, that she didn't know who that was.",,,
1087,0.8352134227752686,5589.8,5594.8,"And what was becoming clear to me, is that she had a form of dementia and didn't really recognize what",,,
1088,0.8141148686408997,5595.0,5604.0, It's going on which was important information for me to know because one that means a she didn't understand what I was doing or she just sort of maybe was passing.,,,
1089,0.8141148686408997,5604.0,5611.7,I think essentially and that's important because that told me a lot about what how that Court proceeding needed to actually operate.,,,
1090,0.8141148686408997,5611.7,5624.5,He was somebody who actually did not understand that they were being evicted at the end of the day and that Court was not going to know that this person was able to sort of come off as I don't want to say.,,,
1091,0.9022263288497925,5624.9,5630.8," Like passing or normal, but you didn't get a sense that there was anything going wrong when you first talked to her.",,,
1092,0.9022263288497925,5631.0,5642.2,So this enabled us to sort of start a process to try to see what we can do to get this court case stayed at least and try to see what services we can provide and we have a social worker on our staff.,,,
1093,0.9022263288497925,5642.2,5644.8,"We have other case, managers kind of help with this sort of work.",,,
1094,0.9022263288497925,5644.8,5654.8,"And it also allows us to steer and eviction away from just having, somebody who has dementia become homeless and where there would be no support for that person, and that",,,
1095,0.8879441618919373,5654.9,5657.7, That is a lot of what we end up doing and whether it's just a simple thing.,,,
1096,0.8879441618919373,5657.7,5663.1,"If somebody owes some bran, which I'll find what we do is connect that person who runs the system's right there in the courthouse.",,,
1097,0.8879441618919373,5663.1,5665.3,That's how we can prevent a lot of evictions.,,,
1098,0.8879441618919373,5665.3,5667.6,And we know how the right to cure statutes work.,,,
1099,0.8879441618919373,5667.6,5684.6,"We've wrote actually a number of the ones that have been a sore last couple of years and we also can help get that eviction off people's records, which is something you can do and Washington's is some extent, you know, a lot of what we do though is problem, solving, you know, it's counterintuitive but moving to right to counsel is also way to do what we're seeing in criminal justice.",,,
1100,0.8377964496612549,5685.0,5690.1, Both which is let's get the legal framework out of these problems.,,,
1101,0.8377964496612549,5690.2,5695.3,Let's try to treat them as social problems that we need to solve collectively to try to help each other out.,,,
1102,0.8377964496612549,5695.3,5696.8,And that's what ultimately evictions are doing.,,,
1103,0.8377964496612549,5696.8,5701.5,"But right now currently evictions are just, it's a railroad.",,,
1104,0.8377964496612549,5701.5,5708.4,"It's a quicker proceeding than almost any other type of proceeding you will go through way quicker than criminal court, anything you would go through there.",,,
1105,0.8377964496612549,5708.8,5714.8,"And a lot of people are shocked, but all of a sudden they find, they have one hearing and they lose their whole home and they barely had",,,
1106,0.8317744135856628,5714.9,5722.4, An opportunity to speak up at that hearing and what we are trying to do ultimately is to make sure that that person is adequate representation.,,,
1107,0.8317744135856628,5722.4,5729.6,That person is somebody who has a fiduciary duty to try to work with that person and make sure that their needs are met.,,,
1108,0.8317744135856628,5729.8,5736.1,"Because right now, I don't think that court is prepared to handle it handle, all the problems that are coming through it and you need somebody.",,,
1109,0.8317744135856628,5736.1,5743.2,There was going to be watching out for a lot of the tenants you are going to be otherwise deprived of their homes when it was a very preventable problem.,,,
1110,0.8317744135856628,5743.4,5744.8,And I think it's how this is.,,,
1111,0.8399859070777893,5745.0,5752.0," Way that by providing that sort of assistance that advocacy there, you can really start trying to get at the core of what's going on here.",,,

1122,0.8813541531562805,5813.2,5814.9," You know, not having that restriction.",,,
1123,0.8813541531562805,5815.2,5818.3,I think it's something really powerful like 85% of,,,
1124,0.9128385782241821,5819.5,5821.5," Yeah, that's the one.",,,
1125,0.8235424757003784,5825.1,5826.4, I don't know if you want to say anything more.,,,
1126,0.8235424757003784,5826.4,5829.6,"I know you've said, talked about it, but I just wanted to note that.",,,
1127,0.8235424757003784,5829.6,5830.8,That's pretty powerful.,,,
1128,0.8235424757003784,5831.2,5831.9,Some numbers.,,,
1129,0.8235424757003784,5831.9,5845.3,"You know, we just tickle analysis is extremely useful and this is really useful and despite a lack of an income limit 85% of those receiving counselor extremely low or low income 9% or moderate income and six-person my chest about.",,,
1130,0.8235424757003784,5845.9,5849.3,"Yeah, I think it's what we suspected would be true.",,,
1131,0.8235424757003784,5849.3,5853.2,But you know when you actually get the data to to see it for yourself.,,,
1132,0.9123114943504333,5853.8,5860.2," I think that you know, the reality is the vast majority of people that go through Housing Court are poor, that's just the reality.",,,
1133,0.9123114943504333,5860.3,5876.7,"And if there are wealthier tenants, they probably are going to opt for private counsel in some cases because they already have whatever they have or there, you know, but basically what has played out in reality is that we're not seeing, you know, they're not seeing done in in San Francisco.",,,
1134,0.9123114943504333,5876.7,5877.4,I seriously doubt.,,,
1135,0.9123114943504333,5877.4,5882.4,We'll see that in Boulder and it conversely in New York City where they had a 200 percent income limit.,,,
1136,0.9087746143341064,5883.1,5889.2," They are seeing tons of people who just don't need it, who are not meeting it and are desperately poor like that because New York is so extensive.",,,
1137,0.9087746143341064,5889.4,5892.0,So and that's true for Seattle as well.,,,
1138,0.9087746143341064,5892.4,5901.0,"So these income limits, they really do present a very big problem in practice because you have to raise that limit pretty high to actually meet the reality if you're in a pricier City,",,,
1139,0.9128385782241821,5903.5,5904.1, Right.,,,
1140,0.9128385782241821,5904.2,5905.1,Thank you so much.,,,

1144,0.9004431962966919,5913.4,5917.4,I realize that I'm kind of asking questions backwards on the agenda.,,,
1145,0.9004431962966919,5917.4,5933.2,"So my apologies, but I wonder if we could go back to the moratorium, question Esther asked, you know, whether we would support it and I will say that, you know, as a council, we've already passed some version of an eviction moratorium.",,,
1146,0.9004431962966919,5933.2,5939.9,I'm certainly interested in learning more about the intent here or the implementation.,,,
1147,0.9004431962966919,5939.9,5942.0,And so I'm,,,
1148,0.8301611542701721,5942.1,5957.3," Wondering, we did get a draft last night, but I'm wondering if I could ask a lie, or Asha, to kind of walk through the actual legislation that we are considering here, so that we can have that conversation.",,,
1149,0.8301611542701721,5957.7,5965.4,"And I realized that we're sort of running out of time, but just wanted to ask for that, before we continue.",,,
1150,0.8301611542701721,5966.1,5966.6,Thank you.,,,

1155,0.8856226205825806,5980.1,5984.6,I can briefly walk through the proposal related to eviction moratorium.,,,
1156,0.8856226205825806,5984.6,5990.1,"And then if you also want a similar summary of the right to counsel bill, that would be awesome.",,,
1157,0.8856226205825806,5990.1,5996.3,"But in general, we are working with council members to want and her staff on a bill that is not yet.",,,
1158,0.8856226205825806,5996.3,5996.6,Introduced.,,,
1159,0.8856226205825806,5996.6,6001.0,That would modify the provisions adopted earlier this year through,,,
1160,0.889647901058197,6001.1,6003.5," Ordinance, 12 6 is 0 75.",,,
1161,0.889647901058197,6003.9,6006.3,"You'll recall, that that bill adopted.",,,

1163,0.889647901058197,6015.3,6024.6,"I just want to pause there for a moment because the email I sent last night, said it ended that it was went into effect at the end of the civil emergency.",,,
1164,0.889647901058197,6024.6,6030.8,It's actually tied specifically to the emergency order that has been extended several times that imposes a,,,
1165,0.8822727203369141,6031.1,6047.6," Moratorium, so what this means is that if the moratorium that's currently in place until March 31st terminate, then the Tenon or their counsel could raised as a defense in court that they suffered financial hardship, due to the covid crisis.",,,
1166,0.8822727203369141,6047.6,6049.8,And that would be used as a defense defense.,,,
1167,0.8822727203369141,6049.8,6061.1,"In eviction proceeding, similar to other defenses, that are made available through the city's just cause ordinance, the adopted again, that would remain as a defense.",,,

1169,0.9026997685432434,6073.2,6087.3,"Drafted would modify the effective period when this defense can be raised to be the later of December, 31st, 2021 or six months after the moratorium terminates and would eliminate the requirement that the tenant must certify.",,,
1170,0.9026997685432434,6087.3,6089.3,They suffered a financial hardship.,,,
1171,0.9120950102806091,6090.3,6105.9," So effectively right now with the moratorium in place until March 31st of 2021, if the mayor didn't extend that an additional burden additional period of time via executive order.",,,
1172,0.9120950102806091,6107.0,6109.6,This defense would be in place through the end of the year.,,,

1174,0.9120950102806091,6110.6,6114.0,The defense would only be available through September of 2021.,,,

1189,0.7475518584251404,6169.7,6178.6,"And I would also urge other council members in the spirit of Esther little Dove John, who spoke about the crisis.",,,
1190,0.7306986451148987,6178.8,6189.9," Is affecting that our senior community, senior errors, if other council members want to announce their co-sponsorship that that this time, obviously you can let me know later.",,,
1191,0.7306986451148987,6189.9,6193.3,"But if you want to announce it now, that would be extremely welcome.",,,
1192,0.7306986451148987,6193.3,6199.8,It will be really heartening to the tenants and the Tenant Advocates to know that you will be supporting this alongside me.,,,

1196,0.9043813347816467,6208.9,6211.3, Planning to speak of councilmember Lewis.,,,

1198,0.9043813347816467,6211.9,6213.2,"Thank you, madam chair.",,,
1199,0.9043813347816467,6213.2,6223.0,I just wanted to publicly acknowledge since since you sort of broke the news to the committee that I'm happy to co-sponsor the right to counsel legislation.,,,
1200,0.9043813347816467,6223.0,6225.3,Appreciate you bringing it Forward.,,,
1201,0.9043813347816467,6225.7,6237.0,"I do also want to say that I appreciated the panel talking about the discrepancies in the thresholds, and sort of the cut-offs for",,,
1202,0.8156037330627441,6238.9,6242.4, Income level and means-testing between the different cities.,,,
1203,0.8156037330627441,6242.8,6244.3,So I agree.,,,
1204,0.8156037330627441,6244.3,6247.4,It sounds like the best practice is to not Implement.,,,
1205,0.8156037330627441,6247.4,6251.3,That policy based on the explanations from the panel.,,,
1206,0.8156037330627441,6251.3,6253.0,So I did just want to clarify.,,,
1207,0.8156037330627441,6253.4,6256.8,That was not necessarily advocating earlier to put that in there.,,,
1208,0.8156037330627441,6256.8,6268.6,"But did want to have a you know, an analysis given that there's a wide spread among a lot of the jurisdictions that have done this and I thought those questions were answered quite well, and I just wanted",,,
1209,0.8967102766036987,6268.8,6271.3, Say I don't I don't think that that would be necessary.,,,
1210,0.8967102766036987,6272.8,6285.4,"And and since we did just sort of receive the to address the eviction moratorium briefly because it was addressed by some of the people on the panel, you know, I've supported all the eviction moratorium that have come up in the past.",,,
1211,0.8967102766036987,6285.4,6289.9,I want to review this proposal with the amount of attention.,,,
1212,0.8967102766036987,6289.9,6298.6,It deserves and I certainly am sympathetic to doing it and would expect to but I want to take a look at the proposal.,,,
1213,0.8089573383331299,6298.7,6316.8," Well, that was distributed to the committee in anticipation of, of the later action, but you know, it as a, as a renter and someone who has always been a renter, you know, I, I'm certainly sympathetic and expect to figure out a way to support it.",,,
1214,0.8089573383331299,6316.8,6318.3,So appreciate those comments.,,,
1215,0.8668715953826904,6320.4,6320.7, Thank you.,,,
1216,0.8668715953826904,6320.7,6321.5,God's mercy Lewis.,,,
1217,0.8668715953826904,6321.5,6326.9,"And yeah, I did not take your question as if you were advocating for any kind of means testing.",,,
1218,0.8668715953826904,6326.9,6334.9,I thought your question brought out really important information and insight and statistical evidence from John and Edmund.,,,
1219,0.8668715953826904,6334.9,6338.8,And I think that that is something that corporate landlords would push for.,,,
1220,0.8668715953826904,6339.0,6340.3,So it is really important.,,,
1221,0.8668715953826904,6340.3,6345.6,We arm ourselves with sound statistical evidence to show why we should not have means testing.,,,
1222,0.8668715953826904,6345.6,6350.0,And I would also say that in fact that is precisely why we,,,
1223,0.8101148009300232,6351.4,6354.7, We meaning tenants and dented Advocates.,,,
1224,0.8101148009300232,6354.7,6365.7,"And based on the information we've received, my office is also advocating that we remove the certification requirement, and I wanted to invite my our Lydia too.",,,
1225,0.8101148009300232,6366.2,6370.7,If you wanted to contribute more on that question and also Edmund.,,,
1226,0.8101148009300232,6372.1,6374.6,I know we have other agenda items and we will get to that.,,,
1227,0.8101148009300232,6374.6,6380.0,"But while we have our panelists here, Edmund, if could you talk about what?",,,
1228,0.8748747110366821,6380.1,6380.5, Happens.,,,
1229,0.8748747110366821,6380.5,6381.3,"I mean, what's this?",,,
1230,0.8748747110366821,6381.3,6382.9,What is this eviction by default?,,,
1231,0.8748747110366821,6382.9,6384.2,What is what is happening?,,,
1232,0.8748747110366821,6384.2,6395.9,"And what are the statistics that the housing Justice project has found in terms of default evictions, if you could share one or two stories of what happens to people when they get evicted by default.",,,
1233,0.8963491320610046,6398.0,6402.7," Yeah, I think this is probably one of the biggest issues that's almost ultimately, even playing a right to counsel.",,,
1234,0.8963491320610046,6402.7,6414.0,"One of the, let me just put it this way when we have contact with 10 as we able to keep them house, at least 56 percent of the time and we have a more likely than not.",,,
1235,0.8963491320610046,6414.0,6419.6,The person will stay house when we're working with that and that's regardless of screening for the merits of their cases or anything.,,,
1236,0.8963491320610046,6419.6,6425.8,We just take anybody who shows up but the biggest problem is that almost half of all tenants.,,,
1237,0.8963491320610046,6425.8,6427.4,Don't show up to their court hearing.,,,
1238,0.7964501976966858,6427.8,6428.8, They don't show up.,,,
1239,0.7964501976966858,6428.8,6431.8,They don't make any contact at all with the corridor with us.,,,
1240,0.7964501976966858,6432.5,6437.1,And we looked at sort of a deep study of Seattle cases from last October.,,,
1241,0.7964501976966858,6437.1,6438.9,September 2019.,,,
1242,0.7964501976966858,6438.9,6443.4,"Actually, 45% of tenants just didn't show up and they defaulted.",,,
1243,0.7964501976966858,6443.5,6448.4,And what happens means either they didn't understand the paperwork.,,,
1244,0.7964501976966858,6448.4,6452.7,"They didn't know they were supposed to respond to the paperwork, which is difficult to do.",,,
1245,0.7964501976966858,6454.2,6457.2,And what happens is they just get a judgment against them.,,,
1246,0.7964501976966858,6457.3,6457.6,They don't have,,,
1247,0.904401957988739,6457.7,6459.2," Their day in court, they don't have the right to defend.",,,
1248,0.904401957988739,6459.2,6460.8,There's nobody who's talking the find out.,,,
1249,0.904401957988739,6460.8,6472.0,"Well, actually, you could have just, this is a preventable eviction, whether it's just because it was a, there's a strong legal defense against it, or even if somebody just old very little bit amount of money.",,,
1250,0.904401957988739,6472.0,6473.9,There was a resource there to help them.,,,
1251,0.904401957988739,6474.2,6476.4,This is a huge problem.,,,
1252,0.904401957988739,6476.7,6480.4,"I think this is a problem across the country frankly, but I think it is pretty noticeable.",,,
1253,0.904401957988739,6480.4,6486.2,Here is that a lot of people don't have a lot of access or don't know how to navigate the court system.,,,
1254,0.904401957988739,6486.3,6487.7,One of,,,

1259,0.8965810537338257,6503.2,6509.3,And so the person had to be basically dry like pulled out by the sheriff and this was somebody who was pretty vulnerable.,,,
1260,0.8965810537338257,6509.3,6512.2,We did not who possibly we could have prevented that eviction.,,,
1261,0.8965810537338257,6512.2,6513.0,I don't know.,,,
1262,0.8965810537338257,6513.4,6517.1,But ultimately it's a lot of people who just don't have that sort of proactive.,,,
1263,0.8076618909835815,6517.7,6523.0," Access or somebody there who's watching it, you know and I think this actually comes up even in other contexts.",,,
1264,0.8076618909835815,6523.0,6524.4,The ever spring in.,,,
1265,0.8076618909835815,6524.5,6526.2,In North Seattle is a good example.,,,
1266,0.8076618909835815,6526.2,6542.7,"A lot of people will be massively evicted but it's very hard because nobody is able to sort of say who's able to stand in and say, I am going to enforce or protect these people or I'm sorry, these time ends before they get evicted and just try to get an injunction stop this.",,,
1267,0.8076618909835815,6542.8,6547.6,All this activity from happening because you need somebody who has that sort of advocacy power that sir.,,,
1268,0.8872737288475037,6547.8,6561.5," In terms of how that sort of Attorney, General style power, who can sort of intervene and make sure people get resources, ultimately, whether it's because they're being illegally thrown out or whether and there's something wrong going going wrong or something wrong in that situation.",,,
1269,0.8872737288475037,6561.9,6565.7,"Or if it's because you just noticed that you see all these cases, you see, somebody's really vulnerable.",,,
1270,0.8872737288475037,6565.7,6569.7,It seems like something that could be prevented and that individual eviction case.,,,
1271,0.8872737288475037,6570.1,6571.2,It's a huge problem.,,,
1272,0.8872737288475037,6571.2,6572.9,I think it's ultimately like right to counsel.,,,
1273,0.8872737288475037,6572.9,6573.2,Frankly.,,,
1274,0.8872737288475037,6573.2,6577.1,It's going to make a huge dent in helping people.,,,
1275,0.8872737288475037,6577.1,6577.6,Stay healthy.,,,
1276,0.7304263710975647,6577.7,6582.0, House without I think really actually incriminate on landlord rights.,,,
1277,0.7304263710975647,6582.0,6582.4,Frankly.,,,
1278,0.7304263710975647,6582.4,6588.9,I think it's ultimately going to be a positive for everyone but I still think you have this big problem of.,,,
1279,0.7304263710975647,6589.1,6591.1,How do we get to all the people who aren't showing up?,,,
1280,0.9128386378288269,6593.2,6593.7, Thank you.,,,
1281,0.9128386378288269,6593.9,6596.2,That was really very useful.,,,
1282,0.9128386378288269,6596.3,6597.5,Informative Maya.,,,
1283,0.9128386378288269,6597.5,6598.7,Did you want to speak?,,,
1284,0.9044552445411682,6601.4,6602.8," Oh, yeah, I just wanted to Echo.",,,
1285,0.9044552445411682,6602.8,6615.4,"Yeah, just how a lot of the tenants who I work with are pushed to are displaced even before they are like they receive a formal eviction notice.",,,
1286,0.9044552445411682,6615.4,6628.4,So they're pressured through harassment or like their landlord isn't making repairs in such a chronic way that people elect to leave their home.,,,
1287,0.9044552445411682,6628.4,6630.1,So it's not like a formal eviction.,,,
1288,0.9017471075057983,6631.4,6639.0," But that yeah, like displacement looks like so many different things because of people not having access to those resources.",,,
1289,0.9017471075057983,6639.0,6649.2,"And so yeah, I just want to Echo the fact that that's like another reason why having certification requirements would just leak in this so much.",,,
1290,0.9017471075057983,6649.2,6660.6,"Because even before getting to the point of eviction people's lack of resources and being pressured by, landlords are preventing people from staying in their homes, so,",,,
1291,0.9128386378288269,6661.4,6662.3," Yeah, thanks everyone.",,,
1292,0.8414761424064636,6663.9,6664.6, Thank you.,,,
1293,0.8414761424064636,6664.6,6670.6,I think that's a very important point that even though the certification requirement is not paperwork.,,,
1294,0.8414761424064636,6670.6,6671.4,That requires.,,,
1295,0.8414761424064636,6671.4,6685.3,"It's not full-fledged means testing, if you will, in which case you actually have to provide proof of income, but it's still an onerous burden because it's paperwork to show that you you are deserving of that service.",,,
1296,0.8414761424064636,6685.6,6689.6,"But as a statistics in cities, like San Francisco show, actually",,,
1297,0.839353084564209,6690.5,6699.6," the vast majority, if not, all of the tenants who will seek the services are people who would have qualified for that service anyway with those restrictions defined.",,,
1298,0.839353084564209,6699.6,6710.2,So I think the evidence that John and Edmund have shared about the right to counsel not having any income restrictions or definitions.,,,
1299,0.839353084564209,6710.2,6720.0,I think it is also sort of very much in line with what Maya and lady have shared about the need to strike out certification requirement.,,,
1300,0.905600905418396,6720.2,6727.9," And once again, I wanted to thank on some observers for announcing his co-sponsorship of the right to counsel build.",,,
1301,0.905600905418396,6727.9,6730.3,Neither of the bills has been formally introduced yet.,,,
1302,0.905600905418396,6730.3,6734.6,"But this is, you know, this is definitely impetus to do.",,,
1303,0.905600905418396,6734.8,6746.9,"Go ahead with the right to counsel measure, but I would say the moratorium extension and the right to counsel measures, go hand in hand because on the one hand, we need the eviction moratorium to be extended.",,,
1304,0.905600905418396,6746.9,6750.0,"For all the reasons that the tenants a tenant Advocates have said, but",,,
1305,0.8537567853927612,6750.2,6755.7," Even with that in place as joint, what John pointed out, landlords could still go to court seeking to evict your tenant.",,,
1306,0.8537567853927612,6755.7,6763.7,"So it's vital, that all the tenants have legal representation to make sure that the eviction moratorium extension is fully enforceable.",,,
1307,0.8537567853927612,6763.7,6772.5,"That is why we have also organized a committee in, in a way where we're both bills and both the ideas are discussed together.",,,
1308,0.8537567853927612,6772.5,6780.1,"And I also wanted to once again, remind everybody as Maya, shared earlier, 6 p.m. Tomorrow is the",,,
1309,0.8883963227272034,6780.3,6782.8, See I believe in which is titled building.,,,
1310,0.8883963227272034,6782.8,6785.8,"Tenant power during the pandemic, the eviction moratorium.",,,
1311,0.8883963227272034,6785.8,6788.5,And of course we are in the days of stay-at-home and zoom.,,,
1312,0.8883963227272034,6788.5,6790.7,So this meeting will also be on Zoom.,,,
1313,0.8883963227272034,6790.7,6792.9,I'm looking forward to that meeting.,,,
1314,0.8812403082847595,6794.4,6797.4, I hate to cut cut short this discussion.,,,
1315,0.8812403082847595,6797.4,6798.5,This was extremely useful.,,,
1316,0.8812403082847595,6798.5,6802.6,I hope council members found this extremely useful as well.,,,
1317,0.8812403082847595,6803.6,6808.1,"But in the interest of time, I will go ahead and express my gratitude to all the panelists.",,,
1318,0.8812403082847595,6808.1,6814.9,"We will have you back when we discussed the legislation more formally, we will need your help at that time, as well.",,,
1319,0.8812403082847595,6814.9,6820.3,But this was a really great grounding for us for those upcoming committee meetings.,,,
1320,0.8812403082847595,6820.7,6824.1,"Now, I will, if there are no further questions.",,,
1321,0.6063111424446106,6824.2,6825.1, Hands and up there.,,,
