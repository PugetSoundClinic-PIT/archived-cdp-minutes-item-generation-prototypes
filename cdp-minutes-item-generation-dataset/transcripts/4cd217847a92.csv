87,0.97,344.711,355.788,Once more a heartless police accountability system that has police policing police has determined that a cop murdering someone only requires a one to three-day Timeout.,42,,

368,0.97,2104.969,2111.909,This is the resolution in support of Starbucks workers who are struggling to form a Union in Seattle as well as at locations around the country.,123,,
369,0.97,2111.909,2121.919,"Just this morning we heard that Starbucks executives are firing workers who are part of the Union organizing leadership in Memphis, Tennessee.",123,,
370,0.97,2121.919,2130.328,"If this doesn't show why representatives need to take a stand against the company's shameful Union Busting, I don't know what will.",123,,
371,0.97,2130.328,2136.167,"Seattle is the headquarters, so this city's elected officials have a special responsible.",123,,
372,0.97,2136.167,2153.784,"As Gianna Reeve, a Buffalo worker who spoke two weeks ago said, Starbucks prides Seattle on being their hometown, but they will rake their employees through the mud.",123,,
373,0.97,2153.784,2166.964,"Rather than essentially requiring a second election after months of threats, Anti-Union propaganda, Anti-Union meetings and lawsuits with the idea that workers can be intimidated by the time that second vote happens.",123,,
374,0.97,2166.964,2180.912,"If Starbucks workers in Seattle Unionize, the resolution further URGES Starbucks to bargain a fair contract, such that the workers can have good standards of living and the company's massive wealth does not flow just to the top executives and shareholders.",123,,
375,0.97,2180.912,2189.32,"And the resolution recommends all workers in Seattle organize in unions to collectively fight for better wages, benefits, and working conditions.",123,,
376,0.97,2189.32,2200.364,"As the Memphis Starbucks workers wrote in their recent letter to Ceo Kevin Johnson, quote, we are here to fight for our safety and our rights as workers that have been denied and shoved away from us.",123,,
377,0.97,2200.364,2206.871,"Please do not bring your so-called Pro-Partner, Anti-Union campaign to Memphis, end quote.",123,,
378,0.97,2206.871,2216.814,"Which side will Councilmembers stand on, with workers like these or the viciously Anti-Union executive who is at this very moment are trying to fire them?",123,,
379,0.97,2216.814,2224.755,Starbucks workers have already demonstrated the importance of having a Union and a fighting approach around concrete demands.,123,,
380,0.97,2224.755,2237.335,The Buffalo workers went on a five-day strike and forced the company to concede on the colossal demand to give all Starbucks workers paid time for quarantine and Self-Isolation if they are exposed to Covid.,123,,
381,0.97,2237.335,2244.875,I thank my sister KATY and all my Siblings at the Martin Luther King labor Council for their full support.,123,,
382,0.97,2244.875,2257.088,"I thank the Washington chapter of the National writers Union who wrote the city council urging a Yes vote mentioning how women, Lgbtq workers, and workers of color make up much of Starbucks' work force.",123,,
383,0.97,2257.088,2264.862,"Across the United States, Union density is at a historic low of 10.3%.",123,,
384,0.97,2264.862,2268.699,Support for unions is higher than it has been since 1965.,123,,
385,0.97,2268.699,2270.601,68% of workers want a Union.,123,,
386,0.97,2270.601,2274.538,How can 68% want a union but only 10% have one?,123,,
387,0.97,2274.538,2285.683,"It is because big business is immensely powerful and uses that power to crush Union drives, except when workers fight back, which is what Starbucks workers are doing.",123,,
388,0.97,2285.683,2296.394,"To be clear, there are unionized workers in grocery stores or at the airport who are Baristas under the Starbucks label and this is important, but they are not employed by Starbucks.",123,,
389,0.97,2296.394,2306.203,The successful Unionization in Buffalo last December represents the only United States employees of this multinational corporation to be unionized anywhere in this country.,123,,
390,0.97,2306.203,2324.755,"And so if this Union movement succeeds nationwide, it will be nothing short of an earthquake, and that's why it's important to have the support from labor unions that we have, and it's also no surprise that Starbucks executives and Billionaires like former Ceo Howard Schultz are engaged in vicious Union Busting.",123,,
391,0.97,2324.755,2331.295,They sent literally hundreds of managers into the Buffalo stores to try to intimidate and Browbeat workers into voting no.,123,,
392,0.97,2331.295,2341.539,"After the majority of workers at four stores signed Union cards, Starbucks began a series of lawsuits to attempt to block those workers from even having the right to vote.",123,,
393,0.97,2341.539,2352.016,Starbucks went to a national labor relations board court to demand that the vote had to include workers outside those locations who had not had a chance to talk to the Union yet.,123,,
394,0.97,2352.016,2355.553,"Starbucks lost that lawsuit, which they are still appealing.",123,,
395,0.97,2355.553,2362.293,Starbucks went so far as to temporarily close two Buffalo Starbucks locations that were in the process of Unionizing.,123,,
396,0.97,2362.293,2366.03,"One of which was, quote, Unquote, Re-Opened as a training center.",123,,
397,0.97,2366.03,2374.638,"As Sydney Durkan a Seattle Starbucks worker at the Broadway and Denny store who just spoke said, quote, we are dealing with meetings and intimidation.",123,,
398,0.97,2374.638,2380.711,"I personally have received final written warning for Union activity, and they will continue to escalate.",123,,
399,0.97,2380.711,2386.083,Starbucks is trying to push the envelope of what they can get away with in their Union Busting.,123,,
400,0.97,2386.083,2390.721,They will continue to do this until there is intense public outcry.,123,,
401,0.97,2390.721,2391.021,End quote.,123,,
402,0.97,2391.021,2393.491,That is why this resolution is being put forward.,123,,
403,0.97,2393.491,2398.529,"And what Starbucks is doing in Memphis, especially outrageous.",123,,
404,0.97,2398.529,2411.208,"Starbucks Baristas in Memphis demanded Union recognition on Martin Luther King day, Mlk day, this year, noting that Mlk was assassinated while supporting striking Memphis sanitation workers.",123,,
405,0.97,2411.208,2421.552,The former store manager at the Starbucks there says she had to quit her job because she was ordered to lie about Union organizers and her conscience would not allow it.,123,,
406,0.97,2421.552,2426.323,We learned that Starbucks has fired the entire organizing committee.,123,,
407,0.97,2426.323,2436.1,"We need Walkouts and solidarity rallies in cities across the nation, including Seattle, to demand that Starbucks executives give the fired Memphis workers their jobs back.",123,,
408,0.97,2436.1,2445.976,"Here in Seattle, Baristas at three locations have begun organizing drives across the country, over 60 locations have been organizing since December.",123,,
409,0.97,2445.976,2471.702,"Two weeks ago, I joined Starbucks workers for an important rally on Capitol Hill, which my office cohosted with Starbucks workers United, the Union that the workers are Unionizing with, and local unions, Cw 7800, the book workers Union, and members from many other unions, around 200, joining us despite the cold and rainy weather.",123,,
410,0.97,2471.702,2478.709,We just heard from park of UAW 4121 in public comment today.,123,,
411,0.97,2478.709,2485.416,Over 800 community members have Emailed the Seattle city council urging a Yes vote on this resolution.,123,,
412,0.97,2485.416,2497.027,I join them in urging Councilmembers to vote yes without watering it down.,123,,

433,0.97,2609.173,2635.566,"Folks at teamsters local 117, unite here, and those who are members of Mlk labor are supportive of this resolution and excited to make sure we are recognizing the existing Starbucks workers in stores in our region and standing in solidarity with their Siblings across the country and in Seattle who are fighting for more Unionization directly with the large Corporation and to bring more unionized members into the labor movement.",131,,

436,0.97,2661.825,2674.505,"As this amendment notes, members of the labor--excuse me, as this resolution notes, and as the sponsor has noted as well, members of labor have grown within Washington state.",131,,
437,0.97,2674.505,2694.725,"The stand, which is the statewide publication that AFL CIO puts out through the Washington state labor Council, they noted that 72,000 more members have joined Union rank and file participation within unions in Washington state, and now Washington state ranks third in Union membership in the entire country.",131,,
438,0.97,2694.725,2711.875,"Just this morning we saw that the number of stores that are Unionizing in now 20 States and 68 stores, that number was just updated to seven years ago, indicating the support for this Unionizing effort.",131,,

480,0.97,2834.131,2841.672,I was not elected to take votes on issues that fall beyond the Purview of city business.,155,,
481,0.97,2841.672,2850.047,"And I believed that a vote on resolution 32041 would be just merely symbolic, because this is an external labor issue.",155,,
482,0.97,2850.047,2853.483,And we have no authority over Starbucks or their employees.,155,,
483,0.97,2853.483,2857.087,And we have a labor movement for that.,155,,
484,0.97,2857.087,2861.258,"And let me be clear, I am Pro-Labor.",155,,
485,0.97,2861.258,2884.648,"I support worker's rights to Unionize, and I oppose Union Busting, or I would not have received support of the Seattle firefighters, the building and construction trades Council and its affiliates, but we have to stay in our Lane and spend our time and energy doing things we know we will directly help the people and the workers of Seattle.",155,,
486,0.97,2884.648,2906.37,"For example, build more affordable housing and work force housing, create more career pathways for our young people, fix our roads and bridges that are workers use to travel on to get to their jobs, and also eliminate the violence and threats against our frontline workers who are victimized by escalating crime at their workplaces.",155,,
487,0.97,2906.37,2913.176,And that will be the topic of my economic development committee meeting tomorrow morning.,155,,
488,0.97,2913.176,2918.081,"So this resolution, I believe, is a distraction from that kind of work.",155,,
489,0.97,2918.081,2930.694,"Now, I understand that President Juarez doesn't want to be the gate keeper on what counts as material city business, and I do respect that Council has adopted resolutions like this in the past.",155,,
490,0.97,2930.694,2935.332,"But personally, I would like to see Council conduct its business a little differently going forward.",155,,
491,0.97,2935.332,2940.003,Because I was elected by people who want to see progress on our major issues.,155,,
492,0.97,2940.003,2943.607,And I made a promise to focus on doing that.,155,,
493,0.97,2943.607,2946.376,So I can't vote yes on this.,155,,
494,0.97,2946.376,2953.35,"My vote matters to me, and I just don't want to start my term with a symbolic vote on my record.",155,,
495,0.97,2953.35,2971.835,"But I also don't want to have a vote that could be misunderstood as Anti-Worker on my record, so I am going to just withhold my vote on this resolution.",155,,
496,0.97,2971.835,2973.704,Okay.,156,,
497,0.97,2973.704,2976.173,Councilmember Pedersen?,156,,
498,0.97,2976.173,2978.875,"Thank you, Council President, colleagues.",157,,
499,0.97,2978.875,2994.891,"In hopes of increasing the productivity and focus on the city Council, we recently updated our parliamentary procedures and rules to provide Councilmembers with the option to abstain from certain resolutions rather than taking time away from the core functions of city government work.",157,,
500,0.97,2994.891,2999.83,We know it takes precious time to thoroughly review issues outside of city government.,157,,
501,0.97,2999.83,3008.138,"Today is the first test of this new rule, and I suspect we might want to further refine this rule by making it more clear.",157,,
502,0.97,3008.138,3013.677,And I look forward to working with our Council president and colleagues to refine it again.,157,,
503,0.97,3013.677,3024.654,"As the co-author of that amendment, I believe this resolution before us today is the kind of resolution on which Councilmembers would Ideally be free to abstain.",157,,
504,0.97,3024.654,3034.398,"This resolution does not provide policy guidance to city departments, the resolution does not Express Council's priorities on its $6.6 billion budget.",157,,
505,0.97,3034.398,3039.102,The resolution is not required by their city or state laws.,157,,
506,0.97,3039.102,3047.244,"Instead, the resolution is an important statement in support or opposition to the actions of private organizations, external to city government.",157,,
507,0.97,3047.244,3055.519,We in the city council have no formal role in these actions.,157,,
508,0.97,3055.519,3059.189,"Moreover, this resolution has not been looked over.",157,,
509,0.97,3059.189,3069.332,"This resolution regarding Starbucks addresses an important issue, and I think we all agree there are so many important issues across the nation and around the globe that are worthy of comment.",157,,
510,0.97,3069.332,3087.317,"At the same time, city hall has a backlog of city government priorities Impacting our districts and all of Seattle, which I believe should be commanding our full attention, such as the need to work with our new Mayor to reduce crime and homelessness.",157,,
511,0.97,3087.317,3088.819,Those issues also impact frontline workers.,157,,
512,0.97,3088.819,3091.154,That's why I'm in my district right now.,157,,
513,0.97,3091.154,3095.092,I absolutely support the right of workers to organize.,157,,
514,0.97,3095.092,3114.811,"It's already well known this city council strongly supports labor, but what's not well known, and what's not getting enough attention, are our Oerts to reduce crime and to reduce homelessness and deal with the scores of other priorities and responsibilities given to us by our city Charter, and upon which I believe we should be focussing our time and legislative schedules.",157,,
515,0.97,3114.811,3134.664,"In addition to using this opportunity to simply state my strong support for workers, I want to enforce my strong support for having City Hall get back to the work of reducing crime, homelessness, monitoring our city's $6.6 billion budget, and addressing the many other problems left unsolved by our city.",157,,
516,0.97,3134.664,3135.265,Thank you.,157,,
517,0.97,3135.265,3136.233,"Thank you, Councilmember Pedersen.",158,,
518,0.97,3136.233,3139.669,"Councilmember Mosqueda, is that a new hand or an old hand?",158,,
519,0.97,3139.669,3141.671,"It is a new hand, Madame President.",159,,
520,0.97,3141.671,3145.308,I'll be brief because I know the sponsor is looking forward to wrapping this up.,159,,
521,0.97,3145.308,3149.312,I do feel compelled to say that this is an important resolution.,159,,
522,0.97,3149.312,3150.48,This is our Lane.,159,,
523,0.97,3150.48,3152.749,This is part of our job responsibilities.,159,,
524,0.97,3152.749,3163.493,"And I think as noted with the headquarters being within Seattle, this is an important opportunity for us at the national level to show solidarity with workers across our region and our country.",159,,
525,0.97,3163.493,3177.974,I don't think there is really another point in recent history that we can point to that shows how important Unionizing is for frontline workers.,159,,
526,0.97,3177.974,3180.377,Their health and safety is constantly on the line.,159,,
527,0.97,3180.377,3185.448,"As already noted, their health and well being along with their livelihood is on the line when they organize.",159,,
528,0.97,3185.448,3197.727,"The sponsor noted the Firings that just happened this morning in Memphis, leaving people without jobs and a paycheck for simply speaking up on--at the workplace, which is a right that all workers should have.",159,,
529,0.97,3197.727,3211.174,"Earlier this week, as noted in the stand as well as in this morning's publication, they noted that a man opened fire in a Fred Meyer store in Washington state here.",159,,
530,0.97,3211.174,3217.213,And often Fred Meyers have Starbucks within them as well.,159,,
531,0.97,3217.213,3238.034,"I think that as we seek to send a message of solidarity with workers who should have the right to speak up and Unionize in every workplace, this is just as much part of our responsibility as it is responding to housing needs across our city, increasing homelessness, worker protections, and expanding protections for working conditions in all industries.",159,,
532,0.97,3238.034,3247.177,"This absolutely is within our Lane, and people getting fired for organizing, people speaking up and facing repercussions and retaliation, that is bad for the health and safety of that worker.",159,,
533,0.97,3247.177,3251.915,It is also bad for the health and safety of our local economy.,159,,
534,0.97,3251.915,3267.998,"If we care about a functioning economy and a more quick and swift recovery and more equitable recovery, that is centered on people having the right to speak up in the workplace and have good living wage jobs and access to Unionization and representation.",159,,
535,0.97,3267.998,3270.5,"Again, I will conclude my comments and look forward to voting.",159,,
536,0.97,3270.5,3289.586,"But I want to correct the narrative on this, because I think this is part of our effort to make sure that people can stay Stably housed, that fewer people fall into homelessness, we see fewer people dealing with stress and crises because they've lost their job or are facing intimidation in the workplace.",159,,
537,0.97,3289.586,3312.309,"I look forward to ongoing efforts among this Council and with our colleagues across the region to send a strong message of support for those organizing within Starbucks stores and to support those who are current Starbucks employees who are represented with teamsters 117, Mlk labor, and unite care.",159,,
538,0.97,3312.309,3313.309,Thank you very much.,159,,
539,0.97,3313.309,3317.614,"Again, strongly supportive of this, and thanks for the time, council Presiden.",159,,
540,0.97,3317.614,3318.615,Councilmember Lewis?,160,,
541,0.97,3318.615,3320.717,"Thank you, Council President.",161,,
542,0.97,3320.717,3333.496,I just wanted to speak briefly to some components of generally raising worker standards being very responsive to some of the work that this Council is doing on homelessness.,161,,
543,0.97,3333.496,3354.551,"We saw a survey earlier this year, maybe it was towards the end of last year, of Kroger employees, frontline Kroger workers, were about 14% reported experiencing homelessness, and 38% reported experiencing extreme economic insecurity, some of which putting them at higher risk of homelessness.",161,,
544,0.97,3354.551,3362.425,"And indeed, in a lot of cases, putting them on the case load for a lot of the programs this Council has been funding.",161,,
545,0.97,3362.425,3372.736,I think that there's a parallel relationship to discussions around hazard pay mandates and insufficient working standards for people that are in service frontline industries.,161,,
546,0.97,3372.736,3406.936,"And I do think it affects our work when we have people who are doing important service sector work or important work in our economy that since the 1980s, the trend of fighting against Unionization has led to a decrease in benefits, a decrease in pay, which in turn has dramatically increased case load, pressure on government to step up and try to fill that void.",161,,
547,0.97,3406.936,3415.311,"And you know, we don't often talk a lot about the folks who are working poor who fall within homelessness.",161,,
548,0.97,3415.311,3431.361,"Like we tend to focus a lot more talking about chronically homeless individual that is tend to pose some of the bigger public policy challenges around addiction, behavioral mental health, and in some cases, low level property crime and prolific offenses.",161,,
549,0.97,3431.361,3473.002,"But you know, the reality is, and I think Councilmember Strauss has talk about this extensively, we have a lot of people who are working in service level jobs, retail jobs, as Baristas or in other kind of frontline employment who are living in Encampments, who are living in vehicles, and are creating an environment where folks can shield and hide criminal activity in some of those Encampments, in and amongst the bigger supply of people experiencing homelessness.",161,,
550,0.97,3473.002,3475.905,All of this fits together into the work we're doing on homelessness.,161,,
551,0.97,3475.905,3491.487,"I think it's important we look at raising labor standards as an important element of our economic development work, which includes the proliferation of Union organizing and allowing more workers.",161,,
552,0.97,3491.487,3502.432,"And under this resolution, you know, it's really just saying let workers have a fair shot at democratically trying to organize as their entitled to under federal law.",161,,
553,0.97,3502.432,3508.638,"And having the city of Seattle be supportive of those efforts, because it does help down the road for our case load.",161,,
554,0.97,3508.638,3522.552,It helps down the road for our efforts to combat homelessness if we have more people who are able to have better standards through better jobs and not falling on the case load of public support and public subsidy.,161,,
555,0.97,3522.552,3547.844,"So for those reasons, I will be voting for the resolution today and do think this is important national conversation and that increased Unionization is a critical component of the work to raise working standards generally and appreciate our analyzing partners, the King County labor Council from calling in, and the work they've been doing with us to advance these critical priorities.",161,,
556,0.97,3547.844,3548.978,"Thank you, Councilmember Lewis.",162,,
557,0.97,3548.978,3557.954,"Let me just make a few comments and then Councilmember Sawant, I will allow you to kind of close out the discussion.",162,,
558,0.97,3557.954,3564.594,"So I want to thank Councilmember Sawant as being the prime sponsor of this, and Councilmember Mosqueda for your amendment.",162,,
559,0.97,3564.594,3568.665,But I do want to address what Councilmember Nelson and Pedersen have said.,162,,
560,0.97,3568.665,3576.339,"And I think it underscores why we have this rule about extension, and what that means for voting no.",162,,
561,0.97,3576.339,3584.48,"The rule, as you know, which we will be Revisiting, requires the Council president at their discretion to look at what is material.",162,,
562,0.97,3584.48,3589.585,"As I shared before, I will always err on the side of things being material, because they will touch on that.",162,,
563,0.97,3589.585,3597.827,I don't want to be the gate keeper of that.,162,,
564,0.97,3597.827,3601.798,I I will disagree a little with Councilmember Mosqueda.,162,,
565,0.97,3601.798,3605.268,"I don't think there's a different narrative, I think we have different opinions.",162,,
566,0.97,3605.268,3608.371,"As colleagues, we can agree to disagree.",162,,
567,0.97,3608.371,3620.917,I hope that the viewing public and my colleagues don't see Councilmember Nelson and Councilmember Pedersen in the words that they say about why they would not be supporting this resolution that makes them Anti-Labor.,162,,
568,0.97,3620.917,3629.559,"I think it's pretty clear, and I think the votes were always there, at least the majority, that this is a labor town, and of course we support labor.",162,,
569,0.97,3629.559,3631.928,That's pretty much what we do.,162,,
570,0.97,3631.928,3640.603,"Whether you call yourself a Socialist alternative a Democrat a progressive Democrat, or whatever name people want to hang around their neck.",162,,
571,0.97,3640.603,3646.676,So for today I do want to share that we do want to Revisit what it means to abstain.,162,,
572,0.97,3646.676,3648.678,I think the abstention tool is important.,162,,
573,0.97,3648.678,3654.15,"We don't have it in place now, but that will be in my committee probably in a month.",162,,
574,0.97,3654.15,3660.39,And I also want to share that I always appreciate that Councilmember Sawant brings these issues to our attention.,162,,
575,0.97,3660.39,3668.431,And we should also point out for the viewing public that Councilmember Sawant's resolution came from Councilmember Sawant.,162,,
576,0.97,3668.431,3678.441,"It did not come from central staff, though central staff is there to provide and assist us with amendments, public resources were not used to draft this.",162,,
577,0.97,3678.441,3682.111,Councilmember Sawant and her staff did this in conjunction with some of her colleagues.,162,,
578,0.97,3682.111,3686.315,"And I appreciate that, because that's the kind of work we should be doing.",162,,
579,0.97,3686.315,3688.618,Whether we agree or disagree.,162,,
580,0.97,3688.618,3707.236,"So I'm hoping going forward, at least for me anyway in the next two years, that we can all agree to disagree, that there isn't a right or wrong, that we can all respect each other's opinion, and that we Revisit the abstention tool, because I do believe that Councilmembers should have the tool on resolutions to abstain.",162,,
581,0.97,3707.236,3718.781,And I'm hoping that the viewing public SEES that not as an TI or against or Repunitive.,162,,
582,0.97,3718.781,3721.05,They took the time to explain their vote.,162,,
583,0.97,3721.05,3723.886,"That's what I appreciate, when people take the time to explain their vote.",162,,
584,0.97,3723.886,3732.095,"I know that Councilmember Sawant in the pass has often asked her colleagues explain their vote, and so I want to thank Councilmember Pedersen and Nelson for doing that.",162,,
585,0.97,3732.095,3743.072,"So with that, Councilmember Sawant, I will let you close us out on this discussion, and then we will go to a vote on the amended resolution.",162,,
586,0.97,3743.072,3743.539,Councilmember Sawant?,162,,
587,0.97,3743.539,3744.74,Thank you.,163,,
588,0.97,3744.74,3749.378,I certainly agree with Council President Juarez that all elected officials should be open.,163,,
589,0.97,3749.378,3754.383,And I appreciate Councilmembers weighing in on why they are going to vote no or stay out.,163,,
590,0.97,3754.383,3759.255,"I'm not exactly sure how that works, but I don't agree that there isn't a right and wrong.",163,,
591,0.97,3759.255,3766.596,"There is a right and wrong, but that right and wrong depends on which side you're on.",163,,
592,0.97,3766.596,3794.824,"Because in the context of a deeply divided system like capitalism where the overwhelming amount of wealth and power resides in the hands of a few Billionaires and the corporate executives and the political establishment and the corporate media that serve them and the overwhelming work labor is being done by tens of millions, hundreds of millions, billions of worker who is see little to nothing of the fruits of that labor.",163,,
593,0.97,3794.824,3799.328,"Political figures cannot be neutral in the face of this deep, deep inequality.",163,,

596,0.97,3803.466,3806.269,It would be great to know how many.,163,,
597,0.97,3806.269,3812.875,"Thousands of coffee shop workers, tens of thousands of workers in the fast food industry, this is very much city business.",163,,
598,0.97,3812.875,3821.45,"You cannot say--if you're an elected official, you cannot say you're Pro-Labor and then vote no or withhold your vote on this resolution.",163,,
599,0.97,3821.45,3827.79,"You have every right to say that, but my message is to working class people in Seattle, do not buy that.",163,,
600,0.97,3827.79,3830.092,That doesn't make any sense.,163,,
601,0.97,3830.092,3834.53,"If you say you're Pro-Labor, you have to vote yes on a situation like this.",163,,
602,0.97,3834.53,3836.265,It's not a neutral situation.,163,,
603,0.97,3836.265,3854.283,"If Seattle is a labor town, it's only because rank and file workers fight for what's just and right, fight because there's a history of fighters in the labor movement, and the way we fought for the $15 minimum wage, the Amazon tax.",163,,

605,0.97,3858.554,3861.09,You want to talk about city business?,163,,
606,0.97,3861.09,3869.899,The Amazon tax that our movement fought for in the middle of the black lives matter movement with phenomenal support from the black community and all working class people.,163,,
607,0.97,3869.899,3875.605,We won that in 2020 because of the grassroots tax Amazon movement.,163,,
608,0.97,3875.605,3879.108,"That was city business, that came for a vote.",163,,
609,0.97,3879.108,3881.677,Pedersen and Juarez voted no.,163,,
610,0.97,3881.677,3898.961,"Another city business item last December, that was the vote to end the hazard pay $4 an hour hazard pay for grocery workers, our hardworking frontline workers.",163,,

613,0.97,3914.41,3922.051,"So all these examples show when Councilmembers say it's not city business, they mean it's city business, but they're not on the side you want them to be on.",163,,
614,0.97,3922.051,3924.82,All of those votes were on city business.,163,,

633,0.97,4060.523,4070.766,What does it mean to be a partner with a Ceo who makes $20 million while you struggle to pay the rent or if they can fire you for trying to Unionize.,163,,
634,0.97,4070.766,4076.238,"If unions allegedly don't do anything, why is Starbucks Terrify of them?",163,,
635,0.97,4076.238,4087.716,"In Seattle, our working class movement has beaten Amazon and Starbucks again and again, not by trying to convince the executives to be kind but by getting organized and fighting back.",163,,
636,0.97,4087.716,4088.751,That's what we will need.,163,,
637,0.97,4088.751,4098.327,That is why I'm proposing the day of a national day of action to Starbucks workers so that we can help spread the Union movement to hundreds of stores.,163,,
638,0.97,4098.327,4099.462,Because that's what is needed.,163,,
639,0.97,4099.462,4102.965,We know the power at the bargaining table comes from power outside.,163,,
640,0.97,4102.965,4118.347,"So we need to be coordinated nationwide and most urgently we need Walkouts and solidarity rallies in cities across the nation, including Seattle, to demand that Starbucks executives give the fired Memphis workers their jobs back.",163,,
641,0.97,4118.347,4120.716,And it's important to fight for this.,163,,
642,0.97,4120.716,4130.025,"This is not only for the Memphis workers, that's important in itself, but if we don't fight back this time they will use the firing tactic to intimidate workers in other cities as well.",163,,
643,0.97,4130.025,4134.263,We have to push back on this.,163,,
644,0.97,4134.263,4137.466,We know it's only when the working class fight that is we can win.,163,,
645,0.97,4137.466,4140.903,Thanks to Starbucks workers in Seattle and everywhere.,163,,
646,0.97,4140.903,4141.871,Let's keep fighting.,163,,

648,0.97,4142.171,4150.446,I see that Councilmember Strauss has his hand up and then we're going close argument or discussion on this resolution.,164,,
649,0.97,4150.446,4157.286,"Thank you Councilmember Juarez, I wasn't going to speak up today because I think my colleagues summarized my points well.",165,,

651,0.97,4160.856,4168.531,I have yet to Miss a strike line with our brothers and sisters who are striking to get better wages and protections.,165,,
652,0.97,4168.531,4179.675,"Point of clarification, point of order, a number of times we have been--our political party has been discussed, and I wanted to clarify this is, in fact, a nonpartisan office.",165,,

655,0.97,4181.777,4188.751,"So with that, I see Councilmember Mosqueda, I did not see, is that a new--a few comments or are you done?",166,,
656,0.97,4188.751,4215.911,"Council President, I know you wanted to call the question, looking forward to voting for this as I already noted, but I think it's important since the two pieces of legislation that were sponsored were called into question that we clarify, especially that it actually undermines the effort to try to tear down folks who are wanting to support Unionizing efforts and wanting to support a broader movement for Progressive values to continue down this line.",167,,
657,0.97,4215.911,4228.891,"As the prime sponsor of hazard pay over a year ago, that legislation went into effect working over a three-week period with grocery workers to make sure that our city was the first Washington State to implement hazard pay for grocery workers.",167,,
658,0.97,4228.891,4234.997,Our city is the one who continues to have the longest hazard pay on the books.,167,,
659,0.97,4234.997,4236.398,We extended that four times.,167,,
660,0.97,4236.398,4239.868,It was always intended to be temporary.,167,,
661,0.97,4239.868,4250.246,"At the partnership with those working on getting longer term protections, that was known to be a short-term fix as we worked to address longer term health and safety issues.",167,,
662,0.97,4250.246,4263.158,"And after four times of having it extended, we said if there was changes to Covid that we would Revisit whether or not it needed to be sunset.",167,,
663,0.97,4263.158,4271.266,"And between the passage of the expiration of the hazard pay and the following week, Omicron numbers ticked up.",167,,
664,0.97,4271.266,4275.17,Always said that we would continue to look at the data and implement it if necessary.,167,,
665,0.97,4275.17,4305.534,"So I just want to make sure that we're clear today as we support workers in our city, in our region, across our country, that we continue to show solidarity for broader organizing efforts and want to make sure that we are clear about the past, especially on the bills that I've prime sponsored where we're continuing to build opportunities for folks to have good living wages, expand opportunities to organize, like through today's call for this resolution, and that we stop with the misinformation.",167,,
666,0.97,4305.534,4316.745,So looking Forbard to having this passed and supporting the Starbucks workers and our broader labor movement which has been supportive of the movement today and the work last year.,167,,

669,0.97,4326.955,4331.794,I'm only going to respond by saying that was not misinformation.,169,,
670,0.97,4331.794,4332.161,That was a fact.,169,,
671,0.97,4332.161,4339.068,All of the Democrats were on the Council last December voted to end the hazard pay.,169,,
672,0.97,4339.068,4343.872,It was Mayor Durkan who --,169,,

730,0.97,4572.367,4599.227,We heard a great presentation in committee last week from the parks Department on the need to have a clearer regime to define what commercial activity might be in a park and to have some kind of system to regulate the extent to which there can be allowed commercial activity both in terms of the time and the space that that takes up in a public park going forward.,192,,
731,0.97,4599.227,4604.199,"So for the first time, this legislation create as definition of what is considered commercial activity.",192,,
732,0.97,4604.199,4625.787,To give a couple of examples of the kinds of activity parks has in mind that they would like to be able to facilitate with some level of consideration and to Dually permit would be something like an exercise class or a yoga class or some kind of mild food concession that might be seasonal.,192,,
733,0.97,4625.787,4648.143,"So some examples that were given were the food truck pilot for permitting in West Lake Park, which has been a fairly common occurrence over the last couple of years in the downtown core and potentially having services similar to that on a seasonal basis in other parks around the city.",192,,
734,0.97,4648.143,4656.852,This legislation was passed unanimously out of committee with five Councilmembers voting in favor and none opposed.,192,,
