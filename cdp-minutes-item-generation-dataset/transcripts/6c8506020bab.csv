33,0.97,148.715,156.356,I'm especially excited about this proclamation because we have a lot of work to do in the horizon.,18,,
34,0.97,156.356,161.861,We also have been able to celebrate a tremendous amount of wins in the last few years.,18,,
35,0.97,161.861,168.768,The Procuration gives us a chance to both celebrate what we have accomplished and to work together on what needs to happen next.,18,,
36,0.97,168.768,181.581,"Some of those accomplishments were passed by the Council through Jumpstart, with more than--with almost $2 million of investments in last year's budget that went directly to affordable housing.",18,,
37,0.97,181.581,187.32,Half of that coming from Jumpstart progressive revenue in Seattle.,18,,
38,0.97,187.32,190.924,And the numbers are collected to grow in the upcoming years.,18,,
39,0.97,190.924,205.738,"We have tripled investments and homeownership opportunities with a focus on communities who have largely been locked out of homeownership opportunities due to current and past discriminatory housing policies, both lending and zoning policies.",18,,
40,0.97,205.738,217.283,"We have established a community focused acquisition and development fund to help remove barriers for especially smaller community rooted organizations that are led by and rooted in communities most at risk of displacement, meaning communities of color.",18,,
41,0.97,217.283,229.362,And we have created housing serving those community's most at risk of displacement through policies like affirmative marketing and community preference.,18,,
42,0.97,229.362,245.044,We created an ongoing funding stream for the equitable development initiative to fund projects that group communities in place and Co- locate housing services and small business and cultural space altogether on housing to create more than just a home but to create a sense of place.,18,,
43,0.97,245.044,270.336,"And we are recognizing through this proclamation the intersection of housing and climate crises and how those the ways in which as we build affordable housing and invest in green new deal strategies, we can continue to address the pressing need to create a formal housing with in our city and address climate resilience their housing stock to improve Weatherization and Electrification within the housing options within our city.",18,,
44,0.97,270.336,275.375,"This is a great opportunity for us to reflect on what has been done and going forward, what needs to happen.",18,,
45,0.97,275.375,296.729,"Mr. President, very briefly, I think the importance of Covid, the method to stay home and healthy when so many people are lacking a place to call home, has really exacerbated and emphasize the idea for us to build more portable housing.",18,,
46,0.97,296.729,299.332,Housing has continued to increase in the wake of Covid.,18,,
47,0.97,299.332,314.681,And we channel much of our Covid relief dollars to enabling the office of housing and the affordable housing partners to seize opportunity in the real estate market and to acquire new buildings and buildings that would have otherwise gone derelict or been for sale on the private market.,18,,
48,0.97,314.681,328.327,"Working together with counsel, the state Legislature and Federal funding, we were able to bring properties off the private market and Convet them into affordable housing using rapid acquisition funding and partnership with the county.",18,,
49,0.97,328.327,338.104,And we are getting more properties--more units stood up than ever before.,18,,
50,0.97,338.104,348.081,Seattle is getting national attention because we are Leveraging the state and Federal resources and we are expediting the creation of affordable housing and we are doing this in partnership with our affordable housing providers.,18,,
51,0.97,348.081,360.326,There are over 5400 new affordable units currently under development with 4000 of those opening in this upcoming year.,18,,
52,0.97,360.326,363.896,That is an incredible investment and it is equal to about seven multifamily units that we took off the private market.,18,,
53,0.97,363.896,369.168,And I will conclude with this.,18,,
54,0.97,369.168,374.607,Policies that we have passed over the last few years are really now coming to fruition.,18,,
55,0.97,374.607,380.747,"As policymakers and folks were advocates and community no, it is not often you get to see your work coming to fruition.",18,,
56,0.97,380.747,416.382,"And this year, in April, we celebrated the opening of two affordable housing efforts, both creating permanently affordable home ownership, made possible by surplus land legislation that I sponsored in 2018 requiring the city to not sell its public property on the private market and instead, require that the surplus property, whether it is owned by utilities or any other Department, to be Prioritized for the office of housing and for the community housing providers to develop affordable housing.",18,,
57,0.97,416.382,419.118,Priority given to communities most at risk of this placement.,18,,
58,0.97,419.118,424.924,One of these properties is a village garden in partnership with central district and Africa town.,18,,
59,0.97,424.924,426.793,It is utilizing community preference that we passed in 2019.,18,,
60,0.97,426.793,438.571,And affirmative marketing policies that we passed as well to provide homebuyers with historic ties to the central district and to have the first opportunity to have homeownership in the community.,18,,
61,0.97,438.571,448.915,A shout out to our colleagues for all the work you are doing to increase special permitting considerations for supportive housing projects greatly needed.,18,,
62,0.97,448.915,457.056,And to make sure we are cutting down on reducing the time that it takes to build affordable housing.,18,,
63,0.97,457.056,462.762,Can Seattle is the only city in the nation with specific permitting for permanent supportive housing.,18,,
64,0.97,462.762,464.263,So thank you for all your work on that.,18,,

66,0.97,467.733,481.347,We will have a tile or social media post every day to celebrate some of the incredible work that is being done and some work that is still yet to come with the housing levee that will be up for renewal next year.,18,,
67,0.97,481.347,485.618,And so this is a great opportunity for us to think about how we prepare for the housing levy.,18,,
68,0.97,485.618,508.541,We will need projects that invest in affordable housing revenue streams to make sure we stay laser focused on critical long-term investments and making good on our Jumpstart codified in housing levy but need more additional funding that will come with the renewal of the housing levy in 2023.,18,,
69,0.97,508.541,511.344,This is an opportunity to expand and increase affordable housing for winters and First- time homeowners.,18,,
70,0.97,511.344,531.731,"And we need to make sure that we tackle the toughest issue Seattle is facing like many other cities, to come through and follow up on the Rezoning for the city to make sure we are building in every possible place that we can to increase the access to high opportunity neighborhoods and build more affordable housing throughout Seattle.",18,,

130,0.97,930.729,947.012,"The Governance structure for wastewater treatment is frustrating because the city of Seattle, which has the West point treatment facility continues to have Seattle residents subsidized developments in Eastern King County that is paying for the wastewater treatment facility.",37,,
131,0.97,947.012,953.152,"Moreover the city government, the city government has no authority to adjust Wastewaer fees pass directly to customers by King County.",37,,
132,0.97,953.152,963.028,The fate of this original rate increase is now in the hands of King County Council members.,37,,
133,0.97,963.028,974.073,"I'm hoping the King County Council members will ask questions, push back and pushed on the proposed 5.75% rate increase, because the cost drivers have not been justified in my opinion.",37,,
134,0.97,974.073,980.079,Especially when the more reasonable rate of 4% was codified just months ago.,37,,
135,0.97,980.079,981.313,"Council members, concludes my report.",37,,
136,0.97,981.313,982.715,Any questions before we turn it over to Councilmember Strauss?,37,,

189,0.97,1334.9,1336.802,The public safety and human services committee meets tomorrow morning at 9:30 A.M.,40,,
190,0.97,1336.802,1343.375,There are three items on the public safety and human services committee agenda.,40,,
191,0.97,1343.375,1364.262,Percival hear the quarterly response from the executive to the Council's legislative intent about identifying potential Non- sworn officer response for 911 call types identified by the National Institute for criminal justice reform . categorized appropriate for appropriate response.,40,,
192,0.97,1364.262,1375.374,I just want to clarify for my colleagues in the viewing public the 1ST quarter response is not all we had hoped for for the 1ST quarter.,40,,
193,0.97,1375.374,1384.783,I think it is important to hear from the executive on its plans moving forward and to hear from them on their continued support for this work.,40,,
194,0.97,1384.783,1389.354,"Secondly, we will have on the agenda, a resolution 32050 Bonser by Councilmember Nelson.",40,,
195,0.97,1389.354,1394.76,We do have a proposed amendment for the resolution.,40,,
196,0.97,1394.76,1419.417,"And the amendment just clarifies that the resolution is to signal our intent to consider release of funds in an amount necessary to implement (Indiscernible) acknowledging that some of the salary savings, using some of the salary savings as a strategy to help mitigate the (Indiscernible) App.",40,,
197,0.97,1419.417,1431.062,And also recognizing that we will have to consider making the decision from--some of the 2023 budget challenges.,40,,
198,0.97,1431.062,1446.945,"Thirdly, on the committee agenda that we will be hearing, counsel bill 1230 that I'm sponsoring, to provide some funding to address recruitment issues and who work on trying to adjust them sooner rather than later.",40,,
199,0.97,1446.945,1455.52,And not just recruitment issues for police officers but also recruitment issues for hard to fill critical jobs throughout the city.,40,,
200,0.97,1455.52,1473.004,"And the human services Department Fund, I just want to let folks know that the human services Department is seeking proposals to conduct the comparable worth the wage analysis of the local human services sector.",40,,
201,0.97,1473.004,1486.284,Council members will that this was an issue that came up during the budget process last fall and the funds necessary for the study was supported by Councilmembers.,40,,
202,0.97,1486.284,1489.454,I think I was a prime sponsor for that one.,40,,
203,0.97,1489.454,1495.393,It was a very high priority for many of us.,40,,
204,0.97,1495.393,1508.607,"And the basis for that is a recognition that human services workers, particularly frontline staff, are disproportionately Bipoc and women and they are underpaid for the difficult work they do.",40,,
205,0.97,1508.607,1515.714,And the wages they receive do not reflect the education required of difficulty for the value of their work.,40,,
206,0.97,1515.714,1524.689,This results in high turnover positions left unfilled and work that is desperately needed left undone.,40,,
207,0.97,1524.689,1544.776,"So the study itself will consider the core functions and requirements of human services jobs, including the level of authority and responsibility, the required training and environment difficulty, working conditions, hours and determine a value for those elements across sectors.",40,,
208,0.97,1544.776,1551.349,"Not just those in the past, when we did this work, we really only looked to compare to other human services, social services workers.",40,,
209,0.97,1551.349,1562.494,But we recognize that many of the skills and capacities in jobs that are being more highly compensated near some of these same core Competencies.,40,,
210,0.97,1562.494,1571.636,Applications to do the study are due later this month.,40,,
211,0.97,1571.636,1573.004,And work is expected to begin in July.,40,,
212,0.97,1573.004,1580.946,And we I know are looking forward to getting recommendations in time for our fall budget process.,40,,
213,0.97,1580.946,1599.397,"As reported last week on the public safety front, I met with chief Diaz this week and I will be meeting with district 1's on Southwest precinct captain Rivera and I will also be meeting with the inspector general, the inspector general judge.",40,,

215,0.97,1608.573,1613.745,"And finally, I want to note a very sad West Seattle occurrence from the weekend.",40,,
216,0.97,1613.745,1624.255,"There was a pedestrian death when a man was hit by a car on Southwest--California Avenue Southwest, near Southwest Finley street.",40,,

221,0.97,1690.955,1694.793,It is really exciting and inspiring and I'm glad to be able to be there.,40,,

230,0.97,1782.847,1787.318,"Seeing none, I will pass it over to Council President pro Tem Lewis.",40,,

244,0.97,1838.57,1845.443,This is a Mayoral appointment nomination.,44,,
245,0.97,1845.443,1853.384,And the Mayor's office has asked not to move forward with the appointment so I will be requesting that we hold the appointment indefinitely on their behalf.,44,,
246,0.97,1853.384,1856.821,So just a note there.,44,,

255,0.97,1900.798,1907.305,"Last week, I had office hours at the Columbia city (Indiscernible) market.",44,,
256,0.97,1907.305,1915.346,"I met with constituents to discuss how we increase access to housing, how the city is responding to the sound transit's Deis.",44,,
257,0.97,1915.346,1917.415,I had several folks asking questions about that.,44,,
258,0.97,1917.415,1930.295,"A lot of folks expressing support for closing Lake Washington Boulevard to cars and that discussion, the community engagement for that process is starting within the next week or two.",44,,
259,0.97,1930.295,1937.468,We will--should be seeing this from Sdot sin.,44,,
260,0.97,1937.468,1952.917,We had folks come by to talk about air quality and noise impact of the potential expansion of the King County Airport in Georgetown and these folks were specifically from the beacon Hill neighborhood.,44,,
261,0.97,1952.917,1955.353,But I know that folks in Georgetown are also concerned about this.,44,,
262,0.97,1955.353,1957.522,So those conversations are ongoing as well with King County.,44,,
263,0.97,1957.522,1967.932,We had folks expressing support for us to lead to his library which is a small cultural space Venue.,44,,
264,0.97,1967.932,1977.141,"They provide those they host cultural events, dancing, music, study nights for young people.",44,,
265,0.97,1977.141,1982.647,And they have thousands of books available for folks on issues around racial justice.,44,,
266,0.97,1982.647,1991.189,Úthey are looking for support from Spu to find a water main solution that allows them to install a bathroom.,44,,
267,0.97,1991.189,1995.827,It is very small space.,44,,
268,0.97,1995.827,1998.529,I'm hoping that they are able to work with the Department.,44,,
269,0.97,1998.529,2005.903,We did submit a letter on their behalf to try to find a solution there.,44,,
270,0.97,2005.903,2015.213,"Last week, my staff and I were briefed on the Seattle public school's plan to adopt a car, drop ball--Drop-Off and pickup area on 1670 South adjacent to Mercer middle school.",44,,
271,0.97,2015.213,2026.491,This right now is--the only moderately safe route for people connecting from South beacon hill to North beacon Hill.,44,,
272,0.97,2026.491,2037.335,"And by extension, really it is one of the very few ways for% folks to--in the district to move North by bike.",44,,
273,0.97,2037.335,2039.971,"And the corridor is used by parents, getting their kids to and from Childcare.",44,,
274,0.97,2039.971,2043.408,Young people who can't drive and others.,44,,
275,0.97,2043.408,2052.016,"So it is an important, fairly safe corridor for people.",44,,
276,0.97,2052.016,2076.607,"The school district's plan is to create a new Drive-Up area that would potentially include three different intersections with cars and pedestrians and so folks are concerned about the potential impact here . so as a consequence, I'm asking Sdot to Prioritize building out the second segment of the beacon bike route to coincide with school district plans.",44,,
277,0.97,2076.607,2089.32,"I think that if we are able to make this happen, it could be a Win-Win for the District and for people going North and South on beacon Hill.",44,,
278,0.97,2089.32,2096.594,So we will continue those conversations and I'm looking forward to working with Sdot to make sure that it happens.,44,,
279,0.97,2096.594,2108.94,"Related to schools, I know families across the city are expressing concern about a proposed addition of a third start time for elementary school students and a shift for middle school and high school students.",44,,
280,0.97,2108.94,2114.145,The proposal really stems from transportation budget issues.,44,,
281,0.97,2114.145,2125.089,But we are now talking about elementary school kids starting school as early as 7:30.,44,,
282,0.97,2125.089,2128.159,"It is going to impact families who will need more Childcare support, either before school or Afterschool.",44,,
283,0.97,2128.159,2136.434,And so I have talked to deal and ask them to investigate ways that the city would be able to provide more Childcare support for families.,44,,
284,0.97,2136.434,2145.076,I think this will district had intended to vote on this soon.,44,,
285,0.97,2145.076,2151.549,I think they are delaying that to give families more time to share their concerns.,44,,
286,0.97,2151.549,2154.252,"Candidly, I don't know what the solution is here.",44,,
287,0.97,2154.252,2166.397,"But I do know that if families are going to be putting their kids on a school bus at 6:30 in the morning, those kids will be getting out of school earlier and will need more support Afterschool.",44,,
288,0.97,2166.397,2172.436,So more to come on that soon.,44,,
289,0.97,2172.436,2176.774,"Last Wednesday, we hosted the monthly Mount Baker community meeting.",44,,
290,0.97,2176.774,2191.856,Our office is currently working on activating safe passage programs from Franklin high school students for the Franklin high school students who have been experiencing issues for the route 7 bus stop.,44,,

294,0.97,2232.93,2253.451,They are very interested in working with the city of Seattle to see how we might be able to engage in similar work to start addressing reparations for our black community members here in Seattle and am excited to know that I believe there was just there were three Council members and staff from other offices as well.,44,,
295,0.97,2253.451,2257.688,So thanks to colleagues for participating in the discussion.,44,,

314,0.97,2382.847,2384.081,It is about controlling women's bodies.,44,,

357,0.97,2665.929,2677.941,We are meeting this week however on May 11th at 9:30 and there are two items on the agenda.,47,,

360,0.97,2692.389,2709.139,"Counsel bills 120-307, and 120- 309, would approve the Seattle police Department's continued use of Audio recording devices and link analysis software and accept the surveillance impact reports in an executive overview for each technology.",47,,
361,0.97,2709.139,2719.817,And this will be the second discussion and possible vote on these bills.,47,,
362,0.97,2719.817,2741.672,"Tomorrow, as was mentioned, I'm looking forward to hopefully voting out my SPD salary incentives program resolution from the public safety and human services Committee, as well as the counsel bills 120- 320, which is Councilmember Herbold's SPD salary proviso modification, which would pay for those incentives.",47,,
363,0.97,2741.672,2783.78,"So in case you missed it, I put aside my competing proviso list of legislation in order to work together on a single piece of legislation with Councilmember Herbold and with support of Mayor Harrell, to put together a package with a spending cap on items that we really need right now to begin better supporting recruitment efforts at SPD and eventually provide for staffing incentives for relocation expenses.",47,,

367,0.97,2797.628,2799.463,Let's see.,47,,
368,0.97,2799.463,2825.022,"This week, I will be attending the Maritime breakfast hosted by the Seattle propeller Club, the North Seattle industrial Association and the port of Seattle, to celebrate National Maritime day which is on May 22nd and also learn more about the Seattle Maritime industrial sector and what city council could do, if possible, to strengthen this sector.",47,,

372,0.97,2876.473,2879.309,And that is one of my external committee assignments.,47,,
373,0.97,2879.309,2892.623,I attended the Wedgewood community council meeting and heard about their neighborhood plan to leverage future zoning changes to better support small businesses in the neighborhood among a lot of other topics.,47,,
374,0.97,2892.623,2905.402,And I attended the Seattle builders council meeting and learned about ways the city could help them meet our needs for building more housing . and the issue of Permittingcame up a lot.,47,,
375,0.97,2905.402,2921.218,There are a lot of other ways that the city could better align our regulatory systems with our overall policy goal of addressing housing and Affordability.,47,,
376,0.97,2921.218,2929.559,And so I look forward to future conversations with this body and seeing ways that potentially my committee can help.,47,,
377,0.97,2929.559,2948.178,"On Thursday, I joined Mayor Harrell and the interim director of Oe Oed, mark McIntyre, to present the proclamation we passed last week, recognizing may 1ST until May 7, as National small business week.",47,,
378,0.97,2948.178,2956.42,"And we presented that to the small business administration's regional administrator, with that proclamation.",47,,
379,0.97,2956.42,2961.224,We did this at (Indiscernible) coffee.,47,,
380,0.97,2961.224,2985.549,"To me, what the main part of the show was that we get to honor the owner, who has won Washington small business of the year award, among many other words, because of what his business does, not only to provide delicious coffee but to provide a community gathering space.",47,,
381,0.97,2985.549,2992.189,And so that was great to be able to meet him and celebrate and honor those awards as well.,47,,

383,0.97,2999.463,3010.173,And I met Chris persons and talked with him several times and I knew a bit about the work of community roots housing.,47,,
384,0.97,3010.173,3020.05,"Just hearing how much they were able to accomplish during the last two years, especially during the pandemic, to complete and bring forward so many new projects, was just really inspiring.",47,,
385,0.97,3020.05,3025.822,So that was a great event.,47,,
386,0.97,3025.822,3035.332,"And then, if people think being Councilmember doesn't come with perks, I didn't go to a storm game but the staff and I got a tour of the Seattle Monorail.",47,,
387,0.97,3035.332,3040.837,We met the President of the Seattle model real services and a couple of her engineers.,47,,
388,0.97,3040.837,3052.115,And we took a tour of the maintenance facility at the Seattle center and learned how they keep a 60-year-old piece of Infrastucture going.,47,,
389,0.97,3052.115,3059.99,And it was interesting to learn how they are supporting transit Ridership for games that climate pledge arena.,47,,
390,0.97,3059.99,3063.593,They have surges of about 3000 people in games end.,47,,
391,0.97,3063.593,3066.329,So that is a big challenge they are meeting.,47,,
392,0.97,3066.329,3067.564,So far.,47,,
393,0.97,3067.564,3072.536,And they let me not just blow the horn but I got to drive the Monorail.,47,,
394,0.97,3072.536,3078.742,That was actually sitting in the driver's seat and making it go forward.,47,,
395,0.97,3078.742,3079.743,That was fun for me.,47,,
396,0.97,3079.743,3081.278,And we also visited the woodland park zoo.,47,,
397,0.97,3081.278,3093.523,And the zoo is a regional asset and everybody who has ever had kids might realize how important it is to have that facility on hand to visit.,47,,
398,0.97,3093.523,3100.097,It is also--their mission is improving Biodiversity.,47,,
399,0.97,3100.097,3110.407,And so we were able to learn about their program for Penguins and they let us feed and pet Penguins.,47,,
400,0.97,3110.407,3114.344,And we also got to feed the Red Pand.,47,,
401,0.97,3114.344,3121.318,So that was quite heartwarming as well.,47,,
402,0.97,3121.318,3123.186,And that was pretty much it.,47,,
403,0.97,3123.186,3125.088,If there are questions I'm happy to answer them right now.,47,,
404,0.97,3125.088,3127.224,Does anyone have questions?,47,,
405,0.97,3127.224,3137.0,"Yes, Councilmember Pedersen.",48,,

408,0.97,3145.575,3146.61,Thank you Councilmember Nelson.,49,,
409,0.97,3146.61,3151.248,And I just wanted to thank you and Councilmember Herbold.,49,,
410,0.97,3151.248,3156.353,I'm just reading this press release from the Mayor's office that came out during the Council briefing.,49,,
411,0.97,3156.353,3171.868,"And I appreciate the leadership of the Mayor and you, Councilmember Nelson and the public safety chair, Councilmember Herbold, for what appears to be collaboration on the different pieces of legislation which will make the public safety committee meeting very productive tomorrow.",49,,
412,0.97,3171.868,3184.214,And I think it sends a really strong signal of us trying to work Togetheras a city Council to recruit and retain the Front- line workers that we have lost the most of.,49,,
413,0.97,3184.214,3191.421,And I appreciate--want to say my appreciation to you both.,49,,
414,0.97,3191.421,3192.255,Thank you very much.,50,,

417,0.97,3208.138,3212.108,"Thank you, Councilmember Nelson.",52,,
418,0.97,3212.108,3217.38,Let me just close us out here so that we can get back to the rest of our afternoon.,52,,
419,0.97,3217.38,3228.391,There is no item on this afternoon's agenda from the public asset to the homelessness committee.,52,,
420,0.97,3228.391,3251.715,We did have a chance to have a committee meeting last Wednesday where the Ceo of the King County regional homeless authority joined us for a productive conversation updating the Council Committee on the progress of the regional authority in a number of different areas including the partnership for zero.,52,,
421,0.97,3251.715,3255.852,"The appointment of the system navigators previously, or the system advocates previously the.",52,,
422,0.97,3255.852,3256.219,Navigation.,52,,
423,0.97,3256.219,3295.592,"Referred to as a pure navigation system as well as the announcement that the South Seattle tiny House village--more on that later and my briefing, is going to be opening with support from the King County regional homeless authority, as well as updates on various other shelter requests for proposals and the current status of some of those initiatives, including an update on camp second chance and that investment moving forward fairly quickly, along with the Rfp that is currently outstanding.",52,,
424,0.97,3295.592,3304.701,But I believe closing soon for a RB vehicle safe a lot concept that the Council funded in the last budget.,52,,
425,0.97,3304.701,3319.883,"That was a productive conversation with the Ceo and we appreciate them being generous with their time to update the committee and look forward to continuing to receive the updates on a regular basis, to see how the city investments are being implemented by the regional authority.",52,,
426,0.97,3319.883,3335.598,"We also concluded as a committee that it would be good at this point to get an update from the city's new unified care team, which will--has been assembled by Mayor Harrell under the leadership of deputy Washington.",52,,
427,0.97,3335.598,3358.688,"In order to get a sense of how we as a Council can interact with the resources offered by that team, to indicate areas of interest in our respective districts and moved to better support the team with having resources and community connections to successfully and effectively navigate people expensing homelessness off the street and into shelter or housing.",52,,
428,0.97,3358.688,3377.273,And so that is hopefully some group will be able to get in front of the committee in the near future to hear a little bit about how that process is going and what we can do as the Council to support the work.,52,,
429,0.97,3377.273,3398.061,"Moving forward to last week, along with some of the other colleagues that we mentioned in previous briefing updates, I did have the opportunity to attend a session convened by former Councilmember, county Councilmember Larry Gossett, with the National African American reparations Commission.",52,,
430,0.97,3398.061,3402.932,It was a really good conversation.,52,,

432,0.97,3424.187,3428.458,So it is good conversation and I look forward to continuing them.,52,,
433,0.97,3428.458,3443.072,"I wasn't able to attend on Thursday, the opening of the South end tiny House village or at least the soft opening in anticipation of beginning the process of admitting new villagers to that site.",52,,
434,0.97,3443.072,3465.361,"It was really good to hear from speakers, including representatives from Councilmember Morales' office, former Speaker of the state house, Frank CHA and others who were on hand to commemorate the opening of the village with the generous support of the King County regional homelessness authority as well as several other philanthropic supporters.",52,,
435,0.97,3465.361,3485.215,"So looking forward to that new sheltering asset, being able to take on as many as 60 people currently camping and expensing homelessness and being able to offer them that Non- congregate shelter is a big step forward.",52,,
436,0.97,3485.215,3493.656,And look forward to continuing to support the village as we look for permanent ongoing funding options near the future.,52,,
437,0.97,3493.656,3508.738,"In recognition of small business week, my staff and I took a tour of a Bipoc owned Candlemaking shop in the Belltown neighborhood Friday afternoon.",52,,
438,0.97,3508.738,3531.728,It was a great opportunity to go and make a candle and get to know the employees of that business and hoping to do more small business Outings in the District now that we can increasingly go and do things in person again as.,52,,
439,0.97,3531.728,3532.695,Coming out of the pandemic.,52,,

441,0.97,3543.573,3550.313,So thank you for hosting me on Friday afternoon.,52,,
442,0.97,3550.313,3559.455,And I also have the privilege of taking the tour of a new social justice Incubator space in the Melbourne tower.,52,,

444,0.97,3560.123,3560.99,Called 360 social ventures.,52,,
445,0.97,3560.99,3585.315,"This new public Incubator space will provide a Hub for Like- minded organizations committed to social, economic and environmental justice, to commiserate, share space and resources and engage in programming in this new congregate working space in the Melbourne tower.",52,,
446,0.97,3585.315,3606.97,"I look forward to seeing how this enterprise takes off and provides a new example of unconventional tendencies that can activate downtown spaces that of course, throughout the period of the pandemic, have been very limited due to the limitations on congregate work.",52,,
447,0.97,3606.97,3613.042,So I look forward to the success of 360 social ventures and I appreciate them inviting me to take a tour of their space.,52,,
