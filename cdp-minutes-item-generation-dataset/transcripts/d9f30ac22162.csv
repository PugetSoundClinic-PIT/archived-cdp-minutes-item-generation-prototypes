332,0.97,2852.749,2862.292,That have been facing barriers to equitable homeownership.,56,,
333,0.97,2862.359,2882.179,That includes past practices such as red lining in addition to mortgage lending discrimination and other restrictive racial few out Thats on the presentation and thoughts on initial priorities we have for the upcoming 2022 calendar year budget as it relates to using.,56,,
334,0.97,2882.246,2898.528,We heard from advocates about the need to increase affordable housing Nofa notice of intent for projects to right size the dollar amounts available for shovel ready affordable housing projects.,56,,
335,0.97,2898.595,2913.477,We heard from organizations and our community housing round tables we convene regularly about the need to make sure dollars are by community organizations.,56,,
336,0.97,2913.543,2927.524,I'll bring forward a companion resolution that we are intending to allocate jump start dollars to be accessible to community driven development without requiring that type of income bringing partnership Royed in the past.,56,,
337,0.97,2927.591,2937.534,"The reasons we invested in large jump start collars affordable housing is because we know there's dire needs to ramp up investments, not just a back fill for other priorities.",56,,
338,0.97,2937.601,2946.877,We want to see investments in the to the scale of the need identified in the jump start spend plan we passed.,56,,
339,0.97,2946.943,2952.382,I'll take a quick second to thank Dr. Alvarado.,56,,
340,0.97,2952.449,2969.833,You have on that second point been looking for ways to reduce the requirements for the partnerships on a project by project basis . that's really appreciated . We look forward to bringing that commitment into policy so that we can see that commitment live on in statue.,56,,
341,0.97,2969.9,2980.944,So thanks for your initial work on that as well.,56,,
342,0.97,2981.011,2983.313,Few questions for you.,56,,
343,0.97,2983.38,2985.749,We have central staff on the line as well.,56,,
344,0.97,2985.816,2991.088,Feel free to have them respond as well.,56,,
345,0.97,2991.154,2999.463,The proposed 22 budget Proposeds the office of housing includes roughly 40 million in jump start funds.,56,,
346,0.97,2999.529,3020.183,This is brand new deal funding . that's less than half of what was outlined in the jump start spend plan.,56,,
347,0.97,3020.25,3024.588,That $98 million was initially in that slide we saw yesterday.,57,,
348,0.97,3024.654,3045.675,It is accurate to say a jump start spend plan we are seeing half of that initial amount going towards housing.,57,,
349,0.97,3048.111,3054.484,This is to meet at target but not the full amount of payroll tax revenues.,58,,
350,0.97,3054.551,3071.067,Just confirming the the flight yesterday was highlight the total amount indicate that the funding target was achieved with a mix of funding.,59,,
351,0.97,3071.134,3074.638,Thank you clarification.,60,,
352,0.97,3074.704,3096.226,Colleagues I want to flag that and make sure I fully understood that to questions and comments.,60,,
353,0.97,3100.197,3106.102,We're painfully aware those dollars may not be available and Gratuity.,60,,
354,0.97,3106.169,3113.477,They're one time allocations from our Congression and will from the state passed through.,60,,
355,0.97,3113.543,3115.846,They're intended to address emergency.,60,,
356,0.97,3115.912,3124.955,Questions I'll be asking of staff and colleagues is how to make sure dollars and jump start are added to the degree we added in the initial spend plan.,60,,
357,0.97,3125.021,3127.057,That's something I'm looking at.,60,,
358,0.97,3127.123,3133.196,Thank you for the clarification on that.,60,,
359,0.97,3133.263,3136.399,Two more questions then I'll turn it over.,60,,
360,0.97,3136.466,3146.343,"Emily and team, the budget indicates 17 million used for strategic investments . What is the intend around funds?",60,,
361,0.97,3146.409,3153.35,Are there broader opportunities for those that didn't participate but would align with the intent of jump start spend plan?,60,,
362,0.97,3153.416,3179.376,Thank you for the I think the goal here is really first and foremost about the outcome to invest in projects that are in communities experiencing a high risk of displacement that are proposed from historically rooted organizations.,61,,
363,0.97,3179.442,3179.843,That's the purpose.,61,,
364,0.97,3179.91,3195.892,One is that we have projects that really fulfilled that intent that applied to our typical Nofa process.,61,,
365,0.97,3195.959,3201.698,This would give us the opportunity to support those even more intentionally on the housing side.,61,,
366,0.97,3201.765,3214.077,We have projects that apply to us through our acquisition funds which as you know right now outside of our rapid acquisition Nofa is typically a financing tool.,61,,
367,0.97,3214.144,3225.388,We're borrowing against future money so dollars don't get fully invested in projects as we do acquisition this fund.,61,,
368,0.97,3225.455,3231.761,One I think the the same.,62,,
369,0.97,3231.828,3234.598,This relates to addressing displace expect advancing equity organizations.,62,,
370,0.97,3234.664,3245.542,"Two, I think there are some projects that could be invested in that sought to apply.",62,,
371,0.97,3245.609,3254.618,"Three, I think we have processes underway in which Prole Apologetics will elevate themselves and can be ready for funds pretty quickly.",62,,
372,0.97,3254.684,3254.985,Thank you.,63,,
373,0.97,3255.051,3256.252,I see central staff on the line.,63,,
374,0.97,3256.319,3259.889,Did you have anything to add to that?,63,,
375,0.97,3259.956,3260.156,Okay.,64,,
376,0.97,3260.223,3260.49,Making sure.,64,,
377,0.97,3260.557,3271.534,"So Emily, just on that one, I'm trying to understand where the Mayor's 6000 affordable homes since 2017 gets calculated.",65,,
378,0.97,3271.601,3291.788,The Mayor has been out there talking about how housing investments in the budget are Aligning with Leveraging additional dollars to create 6000 affordable homes since 2017. what are the assumptions based into getting to 6600 unit number?,65,,
379,0.97,3291.855,3301.698,Can you remind me these are project in the pipeline now or not yet in development? What is the AMI level?,65,,
380,0.97,3301.765,3306.636,Is that including the strategic investment possibility there?,65,,
381,0.97,3306.703,3307.203,Great questions.,66,,
382,0.97,3307.27,3309.906,I know this question has been asked by Council central staff.,66,,
383,0.97,3309.973,3350.346,We have sent over a detailed analysis . What I can say is 6000 is counting units that were funded and announced by Mayor Durkan starting in 2017 through 2020 but not including the investments announced as part of 2021. the majority of those units are probably under development in the construction process.,66,,
384,0.97,3350.413,3364.16,Some may be further along . that does not include things that we are funding this year that we may have talked about that are not rolled up into that number . The full description is with Council central staff.,66,,
385,0.97,3364.227,3386.816,I'll say in part that is a significant number from things like one time Resours we've gotten over the years from increases and Mha . There was action taken by Council to implement some new state authority around the sales tax that has boosted production numbers over the last few years.,66,,
386,0.97,3386.883,3391.821,I'm going to ask this question work force development.,67,,
387,0.97,3391.888,3395.458,This is something Council member Morales office is looking into.,67,,
388,0.97,3395.525,3395.959,Then we'll transition.,67,,
389,0.97,3396.025,3400.697,Hopefully that will be a transition to Councilmember Morales' questions.,67,,
390,0.97,3400.764,3406.336,I want to know more about the work force development program.,67,,
391,0.97,3406.402,3415.378,"The proposal for $750,000 for work force development to service and strengthen the agencies in the city.",67,,
392,0.97,3415.445,3420.984,Can you explain the program? are there partnerships with unions.,67,,
393,0.97,3421.05,3427.69,Is this a wage increase we're Talkings about with partnerships with the existing workers?,67,,
394,0.97,3427.757,3432.862,What is it we're actually funding with three quarters of a million?,67,,
395,0.97,3432.929,3458.621,Thank you the is for more years Catholic community services has been working with Seattle colleges to create a certification program that can help people moving forward getting an associate's degree to grow their invest and also expertise in being part of the work force around housing and human services organizations.,68,,
396,0.97,3458.688,3461.191,They have not yet run that program.,68,,
397,0.97,3461.257,3475.004,They've been working with some pilot cope words.,68,,
398,0.97,3475.071,3481.311,This is to help grow the expertise of people who are going into the field.,68,,
399,0.97,3481.377,3488.651,That includes growing expertise about trauma informed care and housing first models and other areas that are really important.,68,,
400,0.97,3488.718,3500.964,"One of the things that we hear from providers, we get some first time people working in our housing and community services organizations.",68,,
401,0.97,3501.03,3503.099,It's hard to find folks in middle tiers.,68,,
402,0.97,3503.166,3506.369,There are a lot of reasons why that's the case.,68,,
403,0.97,3506.436,3506.703,One is wages.,68,,
404,0.97,3506.769,3519.983,One is stress of the job . It is really challenging particularly during Covid . These are high intensity jobs certainly but also about growing expertise and pipeline.,68,,
405,0.97,3520.049,3523.953,This is focused on that as it relates to Union jobs.,68,,
406,0.97,3524.02,3528.758,I'd love to collaborate with you and others on how to make connections.,68,,
407,0.97,3528.825,3537.901,There's a lot of invest from Catholic community services and others to also look at Janitorial staff and growth in the field of workers.,68,,
408,0.97,3537.967,3546.042,We have a shortage there too as it relates to housing and human services organizations.,68,,
409,0.97,3546.109,3547.944,Those jobs are historically represent as part of a Union.,68,,
410,0.97,3548.011,3561.057,I think There's a way to create an additional investment with this work force that can simultaneously grow the piece of the work force as well.,68,,
411,0.97,3561.124,3564.16,Thank you so up.,69,,
412,0.97,3564.227,3571.801,"That is now ringing a Bell with the Councilmember, vice chair support from the Academy from last year.",69,,
413,0.97,3571.868,3574.771,"If it's tie into that, I appreciate the reminder.",69,,
414,0.97,3574.837,3583.78,I'm going to turn over to Councilmember Morales and then to Councilmember Herbold.,69,,
415,0.97,3583.846,3612.108,"Good morning nice to see you director . before I get to my questions, I want to thank you for being really explicit in the ways in which you are trying to lead this organization, this Department through anti principals, incorporating into practices and policies, programs you're doing.",70,,
416,0.97,3612.175,3622.518,Thank you for that.,70,,
417,0.97,3627.89,3650.346,"Can you talk about difference between the 17 million in investments in affordable housing capital, the roughly 50 million expanded capital investment and affordable housing production and the 16 million investments to address residential displacement.",71,,
418,0.97,3650.413,3654.751,I'm just trying to see--are these all different things?,71,,
419,0.97,3654.817,3658.254,How are they connected to one another.,71,,
420,0.97,3658.321,3670.299,I think a theme departments will probably hear from us this week is we don't want to be Duplicating programs if there's work that needs to be done in different departments.,71,,
421,0.97,3670.366,3672.101,We can do that.,71,,
422,0.97,3672.168,3684.58,We're just trying to sort of peel back the onion a little bit and understand what all these programs are and how they're funded . talk a little about those . that would be great.,71,,
423,0.97,3684.647,3685.948,Good morning.,72,,
424,0.97,3686.015,3689.018,"The Councilmember Morales, thanks for those questions.",72,,
425,0.97,3689.085,3706.135,"Largely in the first bucket you saw as part of the ad for the proposed 2022 budget, the 80 some odd million in housing capital . largely the distinction is one about fund source.",72,,
426,0.97,3706.202,3717.013,Really we imagine the majority of funds would be invested through the typical ways that we invest resources now which could include our annual Nofa.,72,,
427,0.97,3717.08,3722.552,To the point the Councilmember made earlier about trying to think of ways to enhance from this year.,72,,
428,0.97,3722.618,3726.422,We have a lot of demand relative to the availability of resources.,72,,
429,0.97,3726.489,3748.377,We could also imagine it helping to allow for more investments that continues to roll now and allow us to purchase buildings currently under cross and could be available for acquisition on Thele market . also support our work around reinvestment which is really important.,72,,
430,0.97,3748.444,3751.914,I need to be on the record of saying this.,72,,
431,0.97,3751.981,3754.383,We can build affordable housing on year one.,72,,
432,0.97,3754.45,3766.028,One of the things we have to make sure is that we don't lose that affordable housing by virtue of it deteriorating.,72,,
433,0.97,3766.095,3769.665,Some capital can be used for that as well.,72,,
434,0.97,3769.732,3781.444,I don't imagine different processes for these funds than the ones that we have now . I think so the 15 million explicitly focused on anti displacement.,72,,
435,0.97,3781.511,3787.617,We'll insure that will meet the outcome but otherwise will be through our regular investment.,72,,
436,0.97,3787.683,3809.038,"Our investments as you know are guided by Council adopted funding policies that drive the population served the income served, goals to further fair housing as well as meet development goals consistent with the TNC funds.",72,,
437,0.97,3809.105,3809.405,Okay.,73,,
438,0.97,3809.472,3810.506,Thank you.,73,,
439,0.97,3810.573,3813.743,That's helpful for trying to assess that out.,73,,
440,0.97,3813.809,3822.518,I'm assuming all of these line items feed into the multi family housing.,73,,
441,0.97,3822.585,3823.186,Is that correct?,73,,
442,0.97,3823.252,3823.653,That's correct.,74,,
443,0.97,3823.719,3830.293,Can you tell me the remaining $20 million in multi family lending?,75,,
444,0.97,3830.359,3830.66,Where is that?,75,,
445,0.97,3830.726,3832.395,Based--I'm sorry.,76,,
446,0.97,3832.461,3841.304,You're asking about the base of our--is this the technical adjustment piece of the 23 million?,76,,
447,0.97,3841.37,3841.637,Yeah.,77,,
448,0.97,3841.704,3850.079,That also goes investment strategy.,78,,
449,0.97,3850.146,3856.185,That is mandatory housing . Ableaffordability proceeds . It comes in on the budget description.,78,,
450,0.97,3856.252,3864.227,It came in a different way . It's projected increase in funds we would have otherwise adopted in our baseline budget.,78,,
451,0.97,3864.293,3865.394,Very helpful.,79,,
452,0.97,3865.461,3876.305,"My last question, I'm excited to see an expansion in funding for homeownership . looks like we're going 2.6 to 8.2 million.",80,,
453,0.97,3876.372,3876.672,That's great.,80,,
454,0.97,3876.739,3880.009,Can you talk how successful this program has been.,80,,
455,0.97,3880.076,3884.046,How does one qualify for assistance?,80,,
456,0.97,3884.113,3892.822,"Then, what kind of programs will be additional funding?",80,,
457,0.97,3892.888,3893.422,Thank you.,81,,
458,0.97,3893.489,3896.359,So our homeownership funds do two things.,81,,
459,0.97,3896.425,3907.403,They support down payment assistance which extends to individual home buyer who seeks to purchase a home on the market in a way which that is subsidized.,81,,
460,0.97,3907.47,3914.243,We invested in the development of homes that were permanently affordable.,81,,
461,0.97,3914.31,3917.48,It is permanently affordable home.,81,,
462,0.97,3917.546,3934.263,"When the home is initially available, it's made available to a low income fire . upon resell, the subsequent home buyer is low income because the equity is capped to insure it stays affordable.",81,,
463,0.97,3934.33,3941.404,We have partnered with Homesite to do the lending and paper around down payment assistance.,81,,
464,0.97,3941.47,3943.339,That program continues to move forward though.,81,,
465,0.97,3943.406,3955.785,I should be clear it is harder to use down payment assistance when Thement market prices for homes are so high.,81,,
466,0.97,3955.851,3958.254,Trying to Chase the market is challenging.,81,,
467,0.97,3958.321,3963.893,We have more invested in our permanently invested home development.,81,,
468,0.97,3963.959,3964.36,That's working well.,81,,
469,0.97,3964.427,3981.811,"We have a few community partners primarily that apply to us, mainly habitat for humanity and land trust are our primary partners we seek to expand and grow our papers.",81,,
470,0.97,3981.877,3984.747,We're working to identify homeowners.,81,,
471,0.97,3984.814,4001.897,"We have other models too . for example, Homestead did a development and work along side the town community land trust to try to recruit home buyers as part of an effort to use.",81,,
472,0.97,4001.964,4003.899,Home buyers don't apply directly to us.,81,,
473,0.97,4003.966,4010.406,They work with community partners to apply for homes.,81,,
474,0.97,4010.473,4017.613,There are certainly more need and demand by home buyers that we are producing homeownership.,81,,
475,0.97,4017.68,4027.656,I know it feels small when we announce we had 50 some odd homes this year . that's scaled for us.,81,,
476,0.97,4027.723,4029.592,We seem seek to continue to grow that.,81,,
477,0.97,4029.658,4029.992,Very good.,82,,
478,0.97,4030.059,4042.271,Look forward to working with you on how we can expand all of that.,82,,
479,0.97,4042.338,4051.947,To preserve homeownership for the community.,82,,
480,0.97,4052.014,4056.752,Thank you very much.,82,,
481,0.97,4056.819,4062.725,Really work of yourself and folks on your team.,83,,
482,0.97,4062.792,4072.601,Appreciate your lifting up the investments that you're making in housing and the presentation as well.,83,,
483,0.97,4072.668,4077.606,I have questions about who--the current program.,83,,
484,0.97,4077.673,4082.211,The first is the home and hope program.,83,,
485,0.97,4082.278,4094.423,You may recall we allocated funds in the past to help buy development work on possible affordable housing locations from our partners at enterprise.,83,,
486,0.97,4094.49,4101.197,It's I think been a really useful investment.,83,,

488,0.97,4123.319,4128.357,Any remaining or is it?,83,,
489,0.97,4128.424,4146.609,This has been helpful working around the use of Seattle city light owned site known as the Dumar site the local community would like to see developed in affordable housing several years ago during the Mha discussions.,83,,
490,0.97,4146.675,4158.988,We insured that even the most of that particular neighborhood was receiving the minimum bump.,83,,
491,0.97,4159.054,4164.927,We made sure a larger zoning increase was done at that particular site.,83,,
492,0.97,4164.994,4169.465,We wanted to use that site for housing.,83,,
493,0.97,4169.532,4187.383,Just wanting to know what status.,83,,
494,0.97,4187.449,4193.222,Gonzalez worked this as well.,84,,
495,0.97,4193.289,4209.471,"$200,000 one time funding for home for good program seems to be remove Ed from the budget.",84,,
496,0.97,4209.538,4214.31,Didn't lose their housing during that transition.,84,,
497,0.97,4214.376,4224.787,Then we found out that it was not necessary because the state was not kicking people off of benefits due to the pandemic.,84,,
498,0.97,4224.853,4243.205,I don't know if we can continue consuming that as we move to 2022.,84,,
499,0.97,4243.272,4253.248,Do we know whether there's funding for home for good included in the 2022 proposed budget if that should occur.,85,,
500,0.97,4253.315,4260.589,Thank you I'll answer most of that question.,86,,
501,0.97,4260.656,4267.763,I can confirm the home is incorporate into our baseline.,86,,
502,0.97,4267.83,4273.435,"It doesn't show discreetly . home for good, we did consider a one time add.",86,,
503,0.97,4273.502,4276.605,That is not included in the 2022 proposed.,86,,
504,0.97,4276.672,4284.079,"So on the answers to those questions, I will confirm with staff.",87,,
505,0.97,4284.146,4286.515,We'll get back to central staff.,87,,
506,0.97,4286.582,4317.146,"I do not believe we have fully expended our home and hope contract for this year . We are regularly billing that with support on Predeveopment and analysis for projects like the one you mentioned at Dumar . that has partnership continues . On home for good, you're right . It is really thoughtful and very much needed subsidy that came at a time in which it's less needed.",87,,
507,0.97,4317.212,4320.249,People ready not transitions off.,87,,
508,0.97,4320.315,4325.32,I don't have the information about when we might anticipate a change in the state policy.,87,,
509,0.97,4325.387,4326.121,I will look into that.,87,,
510,0.97,4326.188,4348.444,"The at this point, we continue to work with community services on whether there are better or decent ways to expend this year's contract.",87,,
511,0.97,4348.51,4351.88,Thank you President Gonzalez.,88,,
512,0.97,4351.947,4354.783,"Council President, Audio is garbled.",89,,
513,0.97,4354.85,4366.261,"Do you mind trying one more time, maybe mute, Unmute?",89,,
514,0.97,4366.328,4366.462,Yes.,89,,
515,0.97,4366.528,4376.905,That may help us out.,89,,
516,0.97,4380.175,4387.015,I'm going to Councilmember left off on the home for good investments.,90,,
517,0.97,4387.082,4400.662,I want to be really clear I understand the allocations that we made in 2019 were actually not spent.,90,,
518,0.97,4400.729,4410.239,"Becky, do you update on expenditure?",91,,
519,0.97,4410.305,4413.408,"2019, 750,000 was",92,,
520,0.97,4413.475,4416.612,I believe the first spent.,93,,
521,0.97,4416.678,4420.382,Sit the 2021 amount we are struggling to spend.,93,,
522,0.97,4420.449,4427.99,Remind me what the amount is?,94,,
523,0.97,4428.056,4428.39,"200,000.",95,,
524,0.97,4428.457,4428.657,Okay.,96,,
525,0.97,4428.724,4442.204,"And that $200,000 has not been carried over into the proposed 2022 budget.",96,,
526,0.97,4442.271,4443.872,That is correct.,97,,
527,0.97,4443.939,4444.306,That's helpful.,98,,
528,0.97,4444.373,4445.808,I'm going to switch gears a little bit.,98,,
529,0.97,4445.874,4458.12,I want to go back to the new investments and housing capital which are Apromptly $89.5 million.,98,,
530,0.97,4458.187,4470.666,I understand There's going to be a renewed focus of those dollars on zero to 30% area median income which I'm extremely grateful for.,98,,
531,0.97,4470.732,4473.602,Thank you for that.,98,,
532,0.97,4473.669,4491.62,I do have questions about the granular details related to that intention . I'll put the questions out . They're both related to the strategic acquisition development fund.,98,,
533,0.97,4491.687,4498.193,Will the $89.9 million include a percentage set aside for new permanent support of housing units.,98,,
534,0.97,4498.26,4510.272,"If so, what is that set aside and how many supportive housing units are we hoping to realize as a result of this new investment.",98,,
535,0.97,4510.339,4520.983,"Secondly, much of the proposed budget for the office of housing is for acquisition and development.",98,,
536,0.97,4521.049,4543.238,I'd like to look at what's Bake into the 2022 budget or what kind of plans the office of housing has for making funds available to affordable housing and permanent supportive housing projects that is specifically dedicated to operations and maintenance funding.,98,,
537,0.97,4543.305,4547.609,Thank you for those questions Council President.,99,,
538,0.97,4547.676,4580.242,"First on the percentage of units that are set aside for permanent supportive housing, we don't have a particular set aside amount . What we do have is, as I mentioned earlier, we expect a portion of this fund of these funds will help us to continue to take applications under our rapid acquisition in, Ofa . through that, we were working with community partners to purchase buildings better used for people experiencing homelessness.",99,,
539,0.97,4580.309,4594.356,"While not the highest intensive permanent supportive housing, that's done by other agencies, this is strong supportive housing people experiencing homelessness.",99,,
540,0.97,4594.423,4632.761,Another portion of funds as I mentioned goes to invest in our typical Nofa . The opportunity to continue that pipeline in part depends on willing partners creating more Psh projects to invest in.,99,,
541,0.97,4632.828,4640.068,Not a set aside percentage . We'll continue to invest in a way that Prioritizes serving extremely low income people.,99,,
542,0.97,4640.135,4645.107,That is part of our policy guidance as well.,99,,
543,0.97,4645.173,4657.352,This really does relate completely to your second question.,99,,
544,0.97,4657.419,4663.925,This is to insure buildings can be built but also operate and have services.,100,,
545,0.97,4663.992,4671.4,Oms is a critical component of the three legged stool of building supportive housing.,100,,
546,0.97,4671.466,4679.307,Right now what we seem to do is leverage new state and county resources that have been created for Oms.,100,,
547,0.97,4679.374,4692.02,We believe that Seattle will be competitive for those funds and also we are eagerly awaiting the county and state to make decision on the availability of those resources.,100,,
548,0.97,4692.087,4699.895,It acts as a moderator on our about to build more.,100,,
549,0.97,4699.961,4707.135,"Regarding your about the baked in amount of, mn in our budget.",101,,
550,0.97,4707.202,4711.44,The baseline is fully funded by levee previously.,101,,
551,0.97,4711.506,4730.792,The technical adjustment in our presentation includes increase in 2.7 million on top of that.,101,,
552,0.97,4731.059,4741.436,"Just to clarify, growth of using new housing capital on new permanent supportive housing is relative to availability of those resources.",101,,
553,0.97,4741.503,4750.245,Again we're seeking to partner with the state and County.,101,,
554,0.97,4750.312,4755.35,That is a significant consideration.,101,,
555,0.97,4755.417,4762.958,"If I am packing what you're describing, let me repeat it back to confirm my understanding.",101,,
556,0.97,4763.024,4768.63,What your saying is the dollars in that bucket are for general purpose.,101,,
557,0.97,4768.697,4800.629,Any housing provider who serves the extremely low income population would in theory qualify to apply to the Nofa and decision about how much of that.,101,,
558,0.97,4800.695,4804.166,So this is my understanding generally.,101,,
559,0.97,4804.232,4804.599,That's correct.,102,,
560,0.97,4804.666,4845.84,So tell me when looking at those Nofa applications on the inside . look at those applications . is there going to be any Prioritization or sort of weight given to projects that are really designed to stand up additional permanent support of housing infrastructure.,103,,
561,0.97,4845.907,4868.83,"I'm concerned in order to effectively, permanently House those that are have experienced chronic homelessness is going to be rather challenging if we don't continue this scale up . I want a sense of internally you go away.",103,,
562,0.97,4868.897,4889.484,You look at these and go what are we doing--is the office of housing going to create an opportunity for there to be more robust and plentiful applications for permanent support of housing?,103,,
563,0.97,4889.551,4929.057,"Thank you for I agree that permanent supportive housing has to be a priority for a funding area in order for us to address a homelessness crisis . from our end, what I can say is the priority for Psh is Bake into the policies of the office and ethics of the office by virtue of the fact our core funding for the office of housing by Ordnance direct 60% of the combined capital and operating to serve folks at or below 30% AMI.",104,,
564,0.97,4929.124,4931.626,We have that Prioritization that happens internally.,104,,
565,0.97,4931.693,4940.735,"I know these are not levy funds, they get invested with our policies in which that remains a priority.",104,,
566,0.97,4940.802,4948.209,Two the question is how we continue to grow our pipeline and communities to invest in permanent supportive housing.,104,,
567,0.97,4948.276,4962.857,That's a lot of work we do . One example of how we do that is work with partners using our acquisition lending to help secure sites that make Psh available for an example now.,104,,
568,0.97,4962.924,4976.137,We have an acquisition loan to create new permanent supportive houses that help set up that property to then come into our Nofa round this year to seek permanent financing.,104,,
569,0.97,4976.204,4976.871,That work is ongoing.,104,,
570,0.97,4976.938,5005.7,"I would say the last thing that's important is that we don't just fund 30% AMI housing in permanent supporting housing buildings . We have a lot of office wide Intentionality in mixed income affordable housing . where there's 30s, 40, 50s, it's good practice and living for people that live in those buildings.",104,,
571,0.97,5005.767,5016.344,"I can say of the many applications we have seeking $100 million, many projects that are not all at 30 include 30s within them.",104,,
572,0.97,5016.411,5027.756,"That's something that we seek to continue to work with our partners to insure not only are those included, those can have the subsidy for operations as well.",104,,
573,0.97,5027.822,5037.999,Thank you for that.,105,,
574,0.97,5038.066,5043.405,I appreciate that response.,105,,
575,0.97,5043.471,5084.913,I think that that merit a policy change in terms of what we are choosing to Prioritize at a minimum for the next couple years while we create that infrastructure that is going to be necessary to actually how has those who are experiencing chronic homelessness.,106,,
576,0.97,5115.143,5148.543,We look at that intensification if you will of sort of front loading investments in the permanent supportive housing and the supportive housing area that really will help us address some of the issues that were seen in our emergency response to homelessness.,107,,
577,0.97,5148.61,5157.852,We'll try to achieve that goal . that's not Abandonedment of the best practice you describe around having mixed income homes.,107,,
578,0.97,5157.919,5174.002,It's more about where should we focus energy now in the short term in order to produce long term assets . They're going to be critical.,107,,
579,0.97,5174.068,5184.512,"One thing I should emphasis, growth you're you can tag about is exactly what we tried to achieve by virtue of housing pilot last year.",108,,
580,0.97,5184.579,5194.355,We worked intentionally with partners to Cocreate additional opportunities . We put our money where our mouth is.,108,,
581,0.97,5194.422,5210.738,We advance an extra year of resources to put out 600 supportive housing units opposed to typical year of 200-300 and look forward to collaboration with you and others on what it looks like to continue that family Sis.,108,,
582,0.97,5210.805,5214.842,I think we have a lot of lessons learned on what we were able to do.,108,,
583,0.97,5214.909,5215.31,Yeah.,109,,
584,0.97,5215.376,5220.181,Thank you for the Rep Minder around that Psh pilot program.,109,,
585,0.97,5220.248,5230.258,I would like to not make it a pilot and make it the thing.,109,,
586,0.97,5230.325,5249.577,Which is what I'm advocating for.,109,,
587,0.97,5249.644,5256.651,We'll support that level of intensification and emphasis around creating supportive housing.,109,,
588,0.97,5256.718,5260.755,This is a of questioning.,110,,
589,0.97,5260.822,5264.993,Some of these decisions were not made within the office of housing.,110,,
590,0.97,5265.059,5270.898,Feel free to defer to director noble or if central staff is on the line.,110,,
591,0.97,5270.965,5274.068,Can we confirm this as well specific to affordable housing though.,110,,
592,0.97,5274.135,5284.979,I want to remind folks we had an assumption there would be $98 million.,110,,
593,0.97,5285.046,5287.215,This year $98 million.,110,,
594,0.97,5287.281,5299.193,"Of that, 82% was supposed to go to deeply affordable construction on multi family units including permanent supportive housing for families at or below 30% AMI.",110,,
595,0.97,5299.26,5319.447,"By receiving a propose it will that includes only 40 million of that 98 million, we now have a situation where the remaining amount to get to the 98 million is being made up by the Federal emergency funds.",110,,
596,0.97,5319.514,5326.087,$50 million is coming from the Feds to get to our goal of 58 million.,110,,
597,0.97,5326.154,5329.624,"Excuse me, of 98 million . that's about 50%.",110,,
598,0.97,5329.691,5332.76,That's what we anticipated going into affordable housing.,110,,
599,0.97,5332.827,5342.77,There's a lot of headlines about the historic investments and affordable housing.,110,,
600,0.97,5342.837,5373.167,"It would be $50 million more had the full allotment jump start gone into place . I think specific to affordable housing, I am concerned and don't know we have the capacity.",110,,
601,0.97,5380.374,5392.653,That further limits our about to create buildings to couple with State and county dollars to create that permanent supportive housing . I am raising a concern about the overall investment in affordable housing.,110,,
602,0.97,5392.72,5415.209,I'm noting that it could have been about $50 million higher had the total amount of jump start funds gone to construction of affordable housing.,110,,
603,0.97,5415.276,5430.792,Then we could pair with State and county dollars to create more Psh to the tune of we were anticipating up to 3900 new affordable housing units until one year.,110,,
604,0.97,5430.858,5433.828,"Central staff, feel free to jump in.",110,,
605,0.97,5433.895,5436.097,Couple comments.,111,,
606,0.97,5436.164,5437.698,General point taken.,111,,
607,0.97,5437.765,5449.277,"Again, this table doesn't highlight there is the $50 million of Federal resources that can be used to match the state and other funding sources to focus on capital.",111,,
608,0.97,5449.343,5479.473,"As importantly, just to make the general point, there could have been $50 million for affordable housing if there were not additional funding priorities that are identified by the Council.",111,,
609,0.97,5483.044,5491.853,This is to take away from the overall budget we're trying to fund that the Council ask we fund across a variety of needs.,111,,
610,0.97,5491.919,5503.431,That is what led us to balance the sources of money to the uses that most well aligned with the constraint.,111,,
611,0.97,5503.497,5508.035,We were working hard to meet the policy intent.,111,,
612,0.97,5508.102,5518.346,I'm not saying we made it word for word.,111,,
613,0.97,5518.412,5524.552,The constraints.,111,,
614,0.97,5524.619,5527.021,That broader context is important.,111,,
615,0.97,5527.088,5527.889,Council considers the overall approach.,111,,
616,0.97,5527.955,5541.035,This is your opportunity to review and consider and make changes as you choose.,111,,
617,0.97,5541.102,5551.312,Thank you.,112,,
618,0.97,5551.379,5552.113,.,112,,
619,0.97,5552.179,5566.26,A lot of numbers thrown around in terms of total number of payroll tax . This is why some of the numbers are not matching up.,113,,
620,0.97,5566.327,5609.403,"We are looking very carefully at the proposed budget and uses of payroll tax and different choices director was highlighting . We'll have a were break down for discussion, issue Id and options for the Council . I would ask that director noble mentioned that in trying to put this budget together, this was balancing the jump start spending priorities as well as another Council spending ads and changes that have been made over the years . I would add to that it is accurate and we will look at there is overlap there . There's commitments made by the Mayor supported by these switches.",113,,
621,0.97,5609.47,5615.81,"It is to provide deeper analysis, issue identification on October 13th.",113,,
622,0.97,5615.876,5620.948,Appreciate that.,114,,
623,0.97,5621.015,5625.419,Let's turn over to Councilmember Morales to round this out.,114,,
624,0.97,5625.486,5628.889,"Thank you, Patty, for that quick work on the slide.",114,,
625,0.97,5628.956,5629.357,Thank you.,115,,
626,0.97,5629.423,5639.333,"I just have a follow up on the conversation around permanent supportive housing . As I understand this, there's funding for the capital.",115,,
627,0.97,5639.4,5644.005,We're waiting on having enough partners.,115,,
628,0.97,5644.071,5661.222,We're waiting on state and county to release funds.,115,,
629,0.97,5664.658,5683.277,How much are we talking about operation of maintenance.,115,,
630,0.97,5683.344,5700.661,We can start to talk about our Intergovernment relation strategy how we start working with County and state partners.,115,,
631,0.97,5700.728,5706.867,Thank you for the office of Intergovernment relations is aware of this issue.,116,,
632,0.97,5706.934,5712.94,I know we have been connecting with our delegation on this.,116,,
633,0.97,5713.007,5718.479,Last legislative session significant new increase in operating and services funding was established at the state.,116,,
634,0.97,5718.546,5738.065,The state is working now on an analysis study and partnership to drive information about how rates and priorities should be set for that funding.,116,,
635,0.97,5738.132,5744.505,There's a process.,116,,
636,0.97,5744.572,5749.343,That's been a historic key resource to leverage.,116,,
637,0.97,5749.41,5755.249,We leveraged this partnership with the county to use sources.,116,,
638,0.97,5755.316,5771.198,They'll have more resources and expecting resources from the Federal Government . It's bit of a limbo and timing issue as we work with partners to insure that those critical services are in place when we need them when buildings open.,116,,
639,0.97,5771.265,5778.839,The more we experiment on bringing units Online faster.,116,,
640,0.97,5778.906,5783.978,"The more we, it takes close negotiation to make sure resources are there.",116,,

643,0.97,5794.321,5799.827,I've long been a fan of Onsite 46 protection too.,117,,
644,0.97,5799.894,5824.985,That is a separate issue . I do think that the idea of making sure that units are more affordable are incorporated and included in the production we're doing . I will leave that at that.,117,,
645,0.97,5825.052,5825.686,All right.,118,,

653,0.97,5879.64,5891.385,In terms of--I know we focus in on permanent supportive housing which would have services on site.,119,,
654,0.97,5891.452,5897.625,"I want to note that in some way, services can be provided offer site.",119,,
655,0.97,5897.691,5917.278,Sometimes somebody is experiencing homelessness that may Notneed the full range of supportive services.,119,,
656,0.97,5917.544,5935.029,"So just looking focusing on zero to 30%, that range and doing more to get projects that have temporary vacancies in their projects to get them to feel those with those experiencing homelessness.",119,,

694,0.97,6250.277,6254.114,"Jeff, central staff.",130,,
695,0.97,6254.181,6266.893,Councilmember Lewis that Reprovide baseline information as context for you as you begin your deliberations of the 2022 proposed budget and particularly focused on investments.,131,,
696,0.97,6266.96,6272.966,I'll provide information on the homeless housing units that will be open or will be opening.,131,,
697,0.97,6273.033,6281.908,"As a starting point, at the end of 2019, there were approximately 4300 city funded homeless housing units in operation.",131,,
698,0.97,6281.975,6291.752,"This is out of a total of 14,400 affordable housing units that were opened that served a variety of other populations.",131,,
699,0.97,6291.818,6305.699,"So, as we look to the first slide, we will see that beginning in 2020 to the end of 2023, the city's inventory of available homeless housing units will increase by 2023 units.",131,,
700,0.97,6305.766,6320.313,"1621 units will be funded by the city toward the Psh levy pilot and 402 units will be funded by the one tenth, 1% sales tax.",131,,
701,0.97,6320.38,6325.385,That supports the acquisition of housing through the help for housing program.,131,,
702,0.97,6325.452,6335.929,"In total, increase over the base of 4300 units.",132,,
703,0.97,6335.996,6341.268,The chart shows of units opened last year.,133,,
704,0.97,6341.334,6347.04,"You can see for 2020, the total was 422 total units.",133,,
705,0.97,6347.107,6351.478,Total units for 2021 was 811 units.,133,,
706,0.97,6351.545,6358.251,The total for 2022 was 816 units.,133,,
707,0.97,6358.318,6366.159,These numbers don't include the 2021 Nofa awards that will be made resulting in additional units coming Online.,133,,
708,0.97,6366.226,6382.876,I want to be clear that opening dates are estimates.,133,,
709,0.97,6388.548,6395.322,It's not only units but the speed with which many of these come Online and are opened.,134,,
710,0.97,6395.388,6412.639,That is a credit to Oh and to their innovations.,134,,
711,0.97,6415.809,6434.161,? I'm talking from the pilot program but also the rapid acquisition program . that afforded us the units up and going.,134,,
712,0.97,6434.227,6453.48,"Much faster than the cycle typical project, financed in year one, financed in two to three years before those open and come Online . fairly significant and Kudos to them for working on new ways to bring units on quicker.",134,,
713,0.97,6453.547,6454.848,Any questions about this chart?,134,,
714,0.97,6454.915,6458.952,All right.,135,,
715,0.97,6459.019,6461.955,Now I'm seeing questions . We'll start with Lewis.,135,,
716,0.97,6462.022,6466.259,We will have Council member Pedersen.,135,,
717,0.97,6466.326,6487.214,Go ahead Council member Lewis . are any of those currently open?,135,,
718,0.97,6487.28,6487.447,No.,136,,
719,0.97,6487.514,6510.77,All of these are--except for the 2020 numbers which are to when they'll be.,136,,
720,0.97,6510.837,6525.619,I want for the viewing public to emphasize those are built this year but we don't have the situation and the city and have those open . that was an important point to make.,136,,
721,0.97,6525.685,6526.119,Thanks for clarifying.,136,,
722,0.97,6526.186,6533.727,I think I'll hold off on additional questions here until we get further into the presentation.,136,,
723,0.97,6533.793,6534.661,Thank you.,137,,
724,0.97,6534.728,6536.196,Council member Pedersen.,137,,

726,0.97,6537.163,6542.102,Just to clarify the last answer for the 811.,138,,
727,0.97,6542.168,6550.243,Did you say they will be Online?,138,,
728,0.97,6550.31,6555.849,That's what I,139,,
729,0.97,6555.916,6558.551,That's their things sometimes happen.,140,,
730,0.97,6558.618,6567.594,"I'm giving that caveat there . that's their expectation they have community dated to me, 811 opened by the end of 2021.",140,,
731,0.97,6567.661,6567.861,Okay.,141,,
732,0.97,6567.928,6568.194,Thank you.,141,,
733,0.97,6568.261,6572.365,I'm sorry if I in the beginning of your presentation.,142,,
734,0.97,6572.432,6592.452,"When you're saying homelessness housing, is that just permanent support of housing.",142,,
735,0.97,6593.753,6606.566,This would be are still homeless but their level of service need is less than those that are served by permanent supportive housing.,143,,
736,0.97,6606.633,6625.251,"It's not the full intensive services provided Psh including lower case manage . behavioral health services, those that go along with the building.",143,,
737,0.97,6625.318,6639.966,It's not all it's in the middle of that . It's permanent supportive housing plus this lighter touch for supportive services for zero to 30?,144,,
738,0.97,6640.033,6640.734,Correct.,145,,
739,0.97,6640.8,6641.001,Okay.,146,,
740,0.97,6641.067,6641.368,Thank you.,146,,
741,0.97,6641.434,6641.968,Thank you chair.,146,,
742,0.97,6642.035,6646.706,Thank you very much.,147,,

744,0.97,6647.741,6651.044,Again apologizes to Jeff and Tracy.,148,,
745,0.97,6651.111,6652.212,Apologies for a false start there.,148,,
746,0.97,6652.278,6652.979,We have one more slide.,148,,
747,0.97,6653.046,6670.03,I want to call attention to the memo sent from central staff that provides as well.,148,,
748,0.97,6670.096,6678.104,"As you can see from chart, 666 units are Parented to open by the end of 2021.",149,,
749,0.97,6678.171,6696.189,489 are issued to open by end of 2022.,149,,
750,0.97,6696.256,6706.299,They have a relevant to our conversation earlier that will provide Oam subsidies.,150,,
751,0.97,6706.366,6707.4,There's 496 of those.,150,,
752,0.97,6707.467,6711.237,The city has Omu with the county.,150,,
753,0.97,6711.304,6722.248,They're going to provide 350 OEM subsidies for city of Seattle funded for capital project for homeless individuals.,150,,
754,0.97,6722.315,6739.933,These numbers don't include service subsidy.,150,,
755,0.97,6740.767,6740.834,.,150,,
756,0.97,6740.9,6744.37,You can see is 2019.,151,,
757,0.97,6744.437,6747.273,It's where these are quarterly numbers.,151,,
758,0.97,6747.34,6750.677,"When it says December 2019, it was October, November, December.",151,,
759,0.97,6750.743,6756.916,That was basically before the pandemic.,151,,
760,0.97,6756.983,6758.051,We had 2284 units.,151,,
761,0.97,6758.118,6763.523,It has Council planned for expansion of emergency shelter.,151,,
762,0.97,6763.59,6776.302,It's where the Council was providing funding with the intention that our shelter system would get larger and handle more people not intention of replacing beds.,151,,
763,0.97,6776.369,6777.07,That's an important distinction.,151,,
764,0.97,6777.137,6795.922,"As you see over the course of the pandemic, the next column covers really April, may, June.",151,,
765,0.97,6795.989,6800.293,Our base was going we're not getting that level of expansion.,152,,
766,0.97,6800.36,6808.935,"By the middle and late part of 2020, you've seen we lost a lot of shelter capacity . that's because of Covid modifications.",152,,
767,0.97,6809.002,6814.44,We had to space people out to make other modifications that were protective.,152,,
768,0.97,6814.507,6823.016,There's a lot of work by services Department that should be acknowledged to intensify and provide locations like Seattle center and things like that.,152,,
769,0.97,6823.082,6827.787,You see you skip now to the fourth column.,152,,
770,0.97,6827.854,6831.291,"There's a light blue bar, temporary beds.",152,,
771,0.97,6831.357,6838.798,That's the executive hotel specific and Kings in coming Online.,152,,
772,0.97,6838.865,6846.272,They're back or Online now . They're still shown there.,152,,
773,0.97,6846.339,6848.641,That is above end of the year.,153,,
774,0.97,6848.708,6858.218,Primarily because of the work to launch temporary beds through the two hotels . Our permanent ongoing capacity is still down in the long term.,153,,
775,0.97,6858.284,6870.129,"If you look by the end of this year, we aren't there yet.",153,,
776,0.97,6870.196,6883.977,"Additional tiny home villages that we talked about a great deal, the Council planned for expansion as well as temporary beds funded throughout the year, all those things combined.",154,,
777,0.97,6884.043,6888.381,A total of 8250 shelter spaces that are available.,154,,
778,0.97,6888.448,6891.951,"A substantial number of those, 286 are going to be going off line.",154,,
779,0.97,6892.018,6895.655,I think the latest is June . Many of them in January.,154,,
780,0.97,6895.722,6899.959,"So if I add another column, you're going to see a big drop coming soon.",154,,
781,0.97,6900.026,6911.037,I was asked to make sure it's clear to the Council what the city funded capacity was Prepandemic to now.,154,,
782,0.97,6911.104,6914.574,Any questions I can answer? all right.,154,,
783,0.97,6914.641,6925.118,"Any questions, I can answer those now and otherwise get over to deputy Washington to go to the next steps.",154,,
784,0.97,6925.184,6928.688,Thank you for chart.,155,,
785,0.97,6928.755,6948.141,"So just for background for the Committee on September 6th, I sent an Email to Jeff and Tracy saying as we go to the budget process, it would be very good for us to review exactly what is happened with our shelter system over the course of Covid to inform our planning.",155,,
786,0.97,6948.207,6966.959,I think where this has been most useful as preparation is what Jeff queued up in terms of the temporary spaces going away making sure that the temporary space going away coincides with permanent capacity coming Online as a general policy goal.,155,,
787,0.97,6967.026,6971.464,I guess my first question will be and Jeff maybe you covered this.,155,,
788,0.97,6971.531,6979.739,"Is that jump in temporary spaces from 197 to 286, that's representing the just care hotels that are going to come Online?",155,,
789,0.97,6979.806,6980.006,Yeah.,156,,
790,0.97,6980.073,6983.042,I don't want to say hotels pleasure.,156,,
791,0.97,6983.109,7003.029,"I guess that would be correct . The Council provided funds in March amended in June and $5.5 million were used to open 89 hotel beds with the just care program largely focused around City Hall park in that area, downtown.",156,,
792,0.97,7003.096,7012.071,Yes the 286 is why it went up 197 to 286.,156,,
793,0.97,7012.138,7012.472,Okay.,157,,
794,0.97,7012.538,7021.781,"Currently as constituted, does this chart include the three additional tiny House villages that we're going to work with the regional authority to stand up?",157,,
795,0.97,7021.848,7022.382,It does not.,158,,
796,0.97,7022.448,7025.852,I want to make sure we have clarity there.,158,,
797,0.97,7025.918,7030.656,The Council and the 2021 adopted budget provided funding.,158,,
798,0.97,7030.723,7046.339,Again a planned expansion of our shelter system.,158,,
799,0.97,7046.406,7069.996,Not showing anywhere on this chart is additional tiny home villages created partly with capital funding graciously provided by the state in the most recent capital budget and Mayor's proposed budget 2022 uses funding for operational funding for those units ongoing adds up to $2.4 billion.,158,,
800,0.97,7070.062,7073.933,There's a lot of same numbers that are different there.,158,,
801,0.97,7074.0,7085.244,"If there was a first quarter panel, that would incorporate new villages like the Rvs.",159,,
802,0.97,7085.311,7089.715,That's probably not included here either.,159,,
803,0.97,7089.782,7090.149,You're Craig.,160,,
804,0.97,7090.216,7090.883,That's not included.,160,,
805,0.97,7090.95,7096.656,In no case did I include anything residing in vehicles.,160,,
806,0.97,7096.722,7126.452,There's 17 spaces operated by contractors at the human services Department . none of that is reflected here . I can't quarantine that.,160,,
807,0.97,7126.519,7130.957,Just want to and isn't reflected in charts.,161,,
808,0.97,7131.023,7139.532,"To a certain extent, that's a good thing.",161,,
809,0.97,7139.599,7142.268,We can pencil in more as we come together.,161,,
810,0.97,7142.335,7168.227,I think this chart puts in stark perspective the causal relationship of why we're seeing so many neighbors living in tents in the city.,161,,
811,0.97,7193.953,7202.528,"Certainly, I can make--at this moment, any of that information that can certainly provide as we go through the budget process.",162,,
812,0.97,7202.595,7210.269,As we approach where central staff will be back to show implication.,162,,
813,0.97,7210.336,7213.539,Thank you very much.,163,,
814,0.97,7213.606,7235.561,I'm thinking it's 150 or so tiny House beds and villages and 45 or so spaces at the 25 or is spaces that the Rv safe lot.,163,,
815,0.97,7236.195,7249.675,I think got to my question that it would be useful to see what January 2022 is going to look like.,164,,
816,0.97,7249.742,7266.292,Another bar for that chart . Maybe July since We've heard that some of the temporary universities are going to be coming off both in January and more in July.,164,,
817,0.97,7266.359,7267.226,Er appreciate additive elements as well.,164,,
818,0.97,7267.293,7275.768,"Again, it would be use to feel see what that looks like.",164,,
819,0.97,7275.835,7283.542,I see nods from staff that appreciate that.,165,,
820,0.97,7283.609,7284.043,Councilmember Morales?,165,,
821,0.97,7284.11,7284.41,Thank you.,166,,
822,0.97,7284.477,7298.257,So I wanted to--I have a question about slide one.,166,,
823,0.97,7298.324,7317.576,"So these 2000 units in 2022, 2023, I'm just trying to get clear on whether those are included in the Mayor's proposed package or already in the pipeline.",166,,
824,0.97,7317.643,7321.847,"What does that mean by unit? studio, hotel?",166,,
825,0.97,7321.914,7327.553,What is a housing unit?,166,,
826,0.97,7327.62,7338.064,How are we defining that?,166,,
827,0.97,7342.968,7344.036,Like how big.,167,,
828,0.97,7344.103,7347.807,Is it a studio?,167,,
829,0.97,7347.873,7348.04,Yes.,168,,
830,0.97,7348.107,7360.886,I think typically the units are studios.,168,,
831,0.97,7360.953,7361.287,I can ask.,168,,
832,0.97,7361.353,7367.827,Let me answer the as it relates to King County units.,169,,
833,0.97,7367.893,7368.627,Some are in hotels.,169,,
834,0.97,7368.694,7370.93,Some are in actual rental buildings.,169,,
835,0.97,7370.996,7373.799,They consider those to be housing units.,169,,
836,0.97,7373.866,7384.376,Some of them include full kitchen as well as bathroom and bedroom all in one unit or in the one space.,169,,
837,0.97,7384.443,7388.214,Some include a Microwave and other things.,169,,
838,0.97,7388.28,7392.952,So they consider those emergency housing units.,169,,
839,0.97,7393.018,7407.299,Those are the units that may be subject to redevelopment as Psh units . They classify as energy units that don't have a full kitchen.,169,,
840,0.97,7407.366,7430.689,"Psh has the separate kitchen facility more like a studio apartment essentially . This would be a full studio apartment, 300 square feet or small efficiency dwelling unit approximately 200 square feet or so.",169,,
841,0.97,7430.756,7435.461,We will fund fully contained bathrooms with kitchens.,169,,
842,0.97,7435.528,7438.831,I'm looking here.,170,,
843,0.97,7438.898,7444.637,Are these already in the proposed budget or already in the pipeline?,170,,
844,0.97,7444.703,7451.143,I'm trying to get a sense of where in the development process these show up in documents.,170,,
845,0.97,7451.21,7473.399,"These are awarded so actually to track back to the 6000 number, these are probably cap captured in that 6000 number and now on their way under construction and in opening.",171,,
846,0.97,7473.465,7473.699,Got it.,172,,
847,0.97,7473.766,7473.999,Thank you.,172,,
848,0.97,7474.066,7474.266,Okay.,173,,
849,0.97,7474.333,7474.567,Wonderful.,173,,
850,0.97,7474.633,7479.572,Any other questions for this opening component here?,173,,
851,0.97,7479.638,7486.245,I want to thank Council member Lewis for the request for this information and for central staff for providing it.,173,,
852,0.97,7486.312,7490.616,I do agree this is helpful Foundational understanding for 2021.,173,,
853,0.97,7490.683,7495.721,"As we will here, there's a bit of transition planned for 2022.",173,,
854,0.97,7495.788,7506.732,"As a reminder for folks, we have a human service Department that included largely our Department providing services to folks experiencing homelessness.",173,,
855,0.97,7506.799,7512.471,The total human services Department is $115 million in funding to address homelessness.,173,,
856,0.97,7512.538,7526.118,91% of that or just over $104 million is going to be transferred to the regional homelessness authority to support programs that were started within Hsd that will be different at some point in the future.,173,,
857,0.97,7526.185,7543.469,I think having this Foundational understanding of what is currently in place as we think about 91% of the funds allocated being Transitioned over understanding what is currently being deployed is important.,173,,
858,0.97,7543.535,7547.339,I'm not seeing additional questions on the two slides and memo.,173,,
859,0.97,7547.406,7556.448,"With that deputy Washington, if you have anything to add, you're welcome to.",173,,
860,0.97,7556.515,7559.485,"Thanks for your patience . We'll transition over to you, deputy Mayor.",173,,
861,0.97,7559.551,7564.79,I don't have to the slides that central staff created.,174,,
862,0.97,7564.857,7581.874,I'm just going to kick us off . If we can go to the key take away slide.,174,,
863,0.97,7581.941,7585.01,"We'll go back one, thank you.",175,,
864,0.97,7585.077,7591.817,Key take homelessness response budget.,176,,
865,0.97,7591.884,7596.355,City wide response structure and budget.,176,,
866,0.97,7596.422,7614.807,Hsd homelessness responds in 2022 with a brief update in 2021.,176,,
867,0.97,7614.873,7618.11,That is what we're planning to go through.,176,,
868,0.97,7618.177,7618.444,Next slide.,176,,
869,0.97,7618.51,7622.247,Key take Aways in the proposed budget.,176,,
870,0.97,7622.314,7631.39,The proposed budget maintains the changes made to programs as a result of Covid- 19 as one time Federal funds ramp down.,176,,
871,0.97,7631.457,7634.593,It maintains an expand shelter capacity.,176,,
872,0.97,7634.66,7660.986,It shifts program oversight to the regional authority while remaining funding to key public spaces clean and accessible . I know some Council members had questions about this area.,176,,
873,0.97,7661.053,7664.123,I hope this chart makes it easier to understand.,176,,
874,0.97,7664.189,7668.527,This is our city wide effort to address homelessness.,176,,
875,0.97,7668.594,7673.365,The city's homelessness response as you see it stretch across multiple departments.,176,,
876,0.97,7673.432,7681.774,"With the stand up of the regional authority, the work to design and fund homeless services will shift to them.",176,,
877,0.97,7681.84,7690.182,"In that first column, that will primarily be shelter and outreach.",176,,
878,0.97,7690.249,7700.426,The remaining columns illustrate the key city operational roles the city will don't lean on to insure public spaces are clean and accessible to all.,176,,
879,0.97,7700.492,7708.667,We will focus on the presentation on significant budget changes found within Spu parks.,176,,
880,0.97,7708.734,7717.443,"If there aren't any questions, I'll pause and hand off to director noble and he'll take us to the next slide.",176,,
881,0.97,7717.509,7718.243,Do folks have questions Heres in.,176,,
882,0.97,7718.31,7725.417,"Thank you, deputy I'm going to try to ask folks to hold questions until the end of your presentation.",177,,
883,0.97,7725.484,7731.49,I know it's going to be challenging because there's multiple facets to it and multiple Presenters.,177,,
884,0.97,7731.557,7736.528,We'll come back around to Council member Lewis and go through the council member's questions.,177,,
885,0.97,7736.595,7739.865,Make a note of your questions and slide.,177,,
886,0.97,7739.932,7742.835,Appreciate your opening remarks is that we can get this kicked off.,177,,
887,0.97,7742.901,7744.703,We'll turn back over to you.,177,,
888,0.97,7744.77,7745.003,Noted.,178,,
889,0.97,7745.07,7745.304,Thank you.,178,,
890,0.97,7745.37,7762.187,I'm going to hand over to director noble who's going to walk us through the next few slides.,178,,
891,0.97,7762.254,7771.797,This shows appropriations for homelessness city wide.,179,,
892,0.97,7771.864,7777.536,"As you can see, obviously significant increases during the pandemic.",179,,
893,0.97,7777.603,7792.518,"In 2020 and most significantly in 2021, you'll NOTE there's two columns 2021. the adopted budget and revised . The revised includes the additional Federal money allocated mid year.",179,,
894,0.97,7792.584,7797.556,You obviously saw a significant drop in appropriations in 2022.,179,,
895,0.97,7797.623,7800.459,There's multiple reasons for that.,179,,
896,0.97,7800.526,7806.198,"The next slide, we have like the most important aspect of it.",179,,
897,0.97,7806.265,7808.167,Three big drivers here.,179,,
898,0.97,7808.233,7828.687,"One is that some of the money that is in this chart is actually moved to other places and no longer--either the sheriff--the lead funding that had previously been attributed to homelessness is in, SD community division.",179,,
899,0.97,7828.754,7831.857,We're not actually--we haven't cut the spending there.,179,,
900,0.97,7831.924,7835.427,That's a significant amount of money.,179,,
901,0.97,7835.494,7837.029,More than $10 million.,179,,
902,0.97,7837.095,7848.207,There's an additional amount due to McKinney funding in the 2021 revised and adopted column.,179,,
903,0.97,7848.273,7852.544,That money will now be as part of our work with regional agency.,179,,
904,0.97,7852.611,7867.859,"That Federal money will go correctly, to the county . North of $20 million decrease is just that shift in the way we're describing the money and where some of it lands initially.",179,,
905,0.97,7867.926,7877.703,I think the bigger issue in terms of highlighted in the next slide.,179,,
906,0.97,7877.769,7879.371,Let's move ahead this.,179,,
907,0.97,7879.438,7883.041,Is showing the intended spending on an operational level.,179,,
908,0.97,7883.108,7915.974,"The other big thing here, the funding allocated mid year, 2021 Federal dollars, only a portion of that is going to get spent in 2021. we always anticipated that some of that resource would be spent in 2022 as well . You can see allocations are equal across 2021 and 2022.",179,,
909,0.97,7916.041,7923.882,This maintains the overall level of sheltering and related services we are providing.,179,,
910,0.97,7923.949,7928.32,The appropriations are heavy into 2021.,179,,
911,0.97,7928.387,7940.032,"Anticipated carry forwards mean the funding levels, actual spending between the two years is essentially consistent.",179,,
912,0.97,7940.098,7955.981,I think its helpful as we dig into the next few slides and presentation digs into the specifics on that and helps you understand how the 2021 investments are sustained or in only cases increased.,179,,
913,0.97,7956.048,7961.887,"Thank you, I know folks are holding their questions to the end.",180,,
914,0.97,7961.953,7968.894,I did the sheriff's hand . do you have quick clarification?,180,,
915,0.97,7968.96,7969.261,Just quick.,181,,
916,0.97,7969.328,7990.082,Maybe Ben could go into a little more detail on it . how much--I would imagine there is a decent amount of under spend this year relative to when investments and assets were realized in terms of added shelter capacity.,181,,
917,0.97,7990.148,7998.857,Something I get a lot of contact about is amount of money that is spent on homelessness response.,181,,
918,0.97,7998.924,8002.26,There's a distinction what is appropriated and what is spent.,181,,
919,0.97,8002.327,8023.281,"I wonder if you could touch on with this how much of the 2021 adopted budget we're going to pass forward due to anticipated under spend . that would be informative . at this point, that's a good thing for us.",181,,
920,0.97,8023.348,8050.409,We have resources to work with . It's revised for 2022.,181,,
921,0.97,8050.475,8052.577,Roughly $60 million difference . move to the next slide.,181,,
922,0.97,8052.644,8067.426,"In terms of the actual spending that we're planning, the relative approximately $30 million of the 2021 appropriations aren't spent aren't anticipated to be spent until 2022.",181,,
923,0.97,8067.492,8074.733,Julie is on and maybe provide more detail at a more granular level.,181,,
924,0.97,8074.8,8078.036,I appreciate the clarifying question.,181,,
925,0.97,8078.103,8094.286,We appropriate the Federal monies as an example knowing not every one of those get spent.,181,,
926,0.97,8094.352,8096.955,Julie can perhaps provide more detail.,181,,
927,0.97,8097.022,8099.224,Ben really nailed it.,182,,
928,0.97,8099.291,8101.56,It's the combination of under spin.,182,,
929,0.97,8101.626,8109.401,The council member is significant and primarily from the Cliffer dollars.,182,,
930,0.97,8109.468,8121.88,"If Council members remember, there's a joint relief plan in past at the end of 2020 to support 2020 and 2021 operations.",182,,
931,0.97,8121.947,8129.087,It was a precursor to the jump start spending plan where 10 million was added in the homelessness space.,182,,
932,0.97,8129.154,8136.661,So some of that money is carrying forward as well and transferring and coming out of that total.,182,,
933,0.97,8136.728,8140.832,It's the carry forward of the Federal grants.,182,,
934,0.97,8140.899,8143.435,It is the removal of one time items.,182,,
935,0.97,8143.502,8157.749,It is the transfer of certain grants the city use to be the direct recipient of . The county is not going to pass through any longer since we don't directly program programs anymore.,182,,
936,0.97,8157.816,8162.254,Those will be redirected.,182,,
937,0.97,8162.32,8166.291,That's really helpful information.,183,,
938,0.97,8166.358,8174.165,Is the under spend number 30 million.,183,,
939,0.97,8174.232,8182.007,That's roughly we are still in September . We don't yet know how the full year will shake out.,184,,
940,0.97,8182.073,8188.98,You'll be able to consider the carry forward and early Q 1 of 2022 from the departments.,184,,
941,0.97,8189.047,8196.454,That comes down as legislation to the Council for you to consider how resources should be used.,184,,
942,0.97,8196.521,8206.398,We won't know the final number until later.,184,,
943,0.97,8206.464,8208.5,It's an approximation.,184,,
944,0.97,8208.567,8213.838,Useful content.,185,,
945,0.97,8213.905,8224.082,Thank you.,185,,

952,0.97,8260.085,8266.257,The hope team will remain with Hsd.,187,,
953,0.97,8266.324,8284.209,Their focus will be on collaborating with the Rha and departments to insure processes stood up to maintain service and connections living with people . We'll present the policy priorities and budget changes to homelessness response in 2022.,187,,

1054,0.97,9576.366,9606.83,Our rose is this idea of ensuring that we have all spaces clean and Assessable for all and making sure that we are able to maintain and restore all the natural assets . The work in this area has been quite challenging and now we are also adding some additional responsibilities.,204,,
1055,0.97,9606.897,9664.821,"On the operational side really trying to respond to the challenges we have had been staff safety and having enough staff to support the work so we are adding a couple of positions here . As we do the regular cleanup around Encampments of Mike as a partner with the regional housing authority as these individuals good connections to services . In addition to our own operations we are also taking on responsibilities on the data, management piece and communication piece that were taken on by the navigation team.",204,,
1056,0.97,9664.888,9692.849,"The capital side, as you can imagine, this is different uses for parks and recreation and has created challenges for the state of the parks and open services so we are proposing funding to restore the parks, every Park is different, when we have had Encampments there has been significant restoration work that has to be done.",204,,
1057,0.97,9692.916,9714.071,"This will help us address that . again, every Park is different so we are estimating but this also does not cover, for example, we had situations where existing equipment has been damaged, this fund does not cover those expenses . I am happy to answer questions.",204,,
1058,0.97,9714.137,9716.573,I think that,205,,
1059,0.97,9716.64,9720.343,"Excellent, thank you much.",206,,
1060,0.97,9720.41,9735.125,"I am not seeing yet the director from the regional homelessness authority, when they come we will make sure to include them.",206,,

1063,0.97,9738.829,9752.876,If there are questions specific we will make sure to get a flag on those to have those asked.,206,,
1064,0.97,9752.943,9756.947,I have a couple of questions.,207,,
1065,0.97,9757.013,9807.831,I want to go back to slide 16 of the presentation . I wanted to ask a question about anticipating 2.4 million for operations for the tiny House village addition but if you go to the previous slide with the Salvation Army's shelter it is anticipated to be 12 million for twice as many Eunice . I in curious about cost per unit.,207,,
1066,0.97,9807.898,9809.432,It is surprising to me.,207,,
1067,0.97,9809.499,9823.28,I wonder what the Salvation Army is doing that is costing so much more than the tiny House shelter was?,207,,
1068,0.97,9823.346,9845.168,They are receiving a combination of operating support over a two year period that is capital funds that we anticipate they will need to identify and stand up a new site.,208,,
1069,0.97,9845.235,9859.816,"As I mentioned the lease that is with Kane County s scheduled to end this, excuse me, next fall.",208,,
1070,0.97,9859.883,9868.158,"Again, those are two years worth of operating dollars plus capital.",208,,
1071,0.97,9868.225,9868.425,Okay.,209,,
1072,0.97,9868.491,9872.429,That 12 million represents two years of operations?,209,,
1073,0.97,9872.495,9882.205,Two years of capital for the stand up of the new a new site.,210,,
1074,0.97,9882.272,9892.415,Okay.,211,,
1075,0.97,9893.683,9897.621,I am having to the math.,212,,
1076,0.97,9897.687,9902.359,Would you mind going back to the previous slide please.,212,,
1077,0.97,9902.425,9917.307,"It is closer, also number of Eunice is significantly different so salvation Army is 240 where the village is only 120 for one year.",213,,
1078,0.97,9917.374,9922.212,There are quite a few elements that make it not an apples to apples a look.,213,,
1079,0.97,9922.279,9934.257,"Right, that makes the numbers closer with the context that that 12 million is for two years of support.",214,,
1080,0.97,9934.324,9956.946,"Again if you take the million needed for capital to stand up the next site we are looking at closer to 10 million, divide that by 2, that is about 5 million for 240 unit which is twice the operating budget for about 120- 130.",215,,
1081,0.97,9957.013,9963.353,With that makes total sense.,216,,
1082,0.97,9963.42,9999.456,"I wanted to talk about the hygiene additions, just to clarify some questions on cost . On adding three station locations for 271,000 I have information from central staff that we are spending 130-190,000 per month to operate hygiene stations.",216,,
1083,0.97,9999.522,10016.206,"Are some hygiene stations more service intensive than others because it seems like a lot of hygiene stations we are adding for 274,000.",216,,
1084,0.97,10016.406,10043.533,We can definitely more information we are pretty confident about the numbers that we can add the three hygiene stations . This includes the maintenance for those twice a day throughout the year.,217,,
1085,0.97,10043.6,10050.373,"But, we can definitely get you more information about the per station cost.",217,,
1086,0.97,10050.44,10053.61,They are all maintained twice a day.,217,,
1087,0.97,10053.676,10060.817,Weird did those where did those numbers add to E-mail to me came from?,218,,
1088,0.97,10060.884,10068.458,If I may they need added in.,219,,
1089,0.97,10068.525,10075.899,They are in.,220,,
1090,0.97,10075.965,10086.943,We are going to go through his last two hands that have mark make some comments.,220,,
1091,0.97,10087.01,10109.799,"The numbers I for the hygiene trailers which also include shower facilities so they are entirely different than what the director is mentioning about the hygiene stations which are toilet facilities and hand washing, so, it is a different class.",221,,
1092,0.97,10109.866,10110.567,It is a the difference.,221,,
1093,0.97,10110.633,10117.774,Different type of service . spent okay.,221,,
1094,0.97,10117.841,10142.699,This is something I will want to get into more as it relates to acquisition versus leasing it back see if we can have a conversation with the Department about some things that we can do that reduce costs and change up some of the Eunice.,221,,
1095,0.97,10142.999,10153.042,I think you are already doing that on my office his behalf so I look forward to continuing that but that clarification is helpful.,221,,
1096,0.97,10153.109,10154.244,Okay.,221,,
1097,0.97,10154.31,10160.216,We would welcome any ideas about Technologies.,222,,
1098,0.97,10160.283,10183.339,"You will be happy to know that the shower, the shower unit s we have purchased have the highest level of durability . We won't have to lease shower trailers anymore.",222,,
1099,0.97,10183.406,10185.241,Unless the program gets expanded.,222,,

1105,0.97,10223.613,10234.257,I am sorry to I do have one question for the director . I want to make sure I have a chance to ask that question.,225,,
1106,0.97,10234.324,10237.26,Certainly.,226,,
1107,0.97,10237.327,10237.961,Please.,226,,
1108,0.97,10242.832,10248.504,Thank you for sharing this information.,227,,
1109,0.97,10248.571,10269.325,Regarding the hygiene services I am sure you will not be surprised to know I am looking for an update on the network that refunded last fall if you could share a little bit of where we are with implementing that.,227,,
1110,0.97,10269.392,10297.52,"Also I am interested to know if you are exploring the idea for the need to access of permanent public toilets . My staff has been entertained that when I have been traveling I sent pictures on public Restrooms from cities all over the place, I have been asking the central staff for some support in getting a better understanding of how much they cost.",227,,
1111,0.97,10297.587,10301.958,I am happy to hear that you are interested in similar things and we can work together on that.,227,,
1112,0.97,10302.025,10310.066,So if you could give us an update on the network and any information you have about permanent public toilets.,227,,
1113,0.97,10310.133,10330.687,I am sorry to I will ask you to ask your question along with the Councilman so that the director can answer the questions at the same time.,228,,
1114,0.97,10341.664,10368.157,I have questions Rv Pumpout it States here it is being framed as an Enhancement because you are proposing to increase frequency every four weeks because it is ever six weeks currently.,229,,
1115,0.97,10368.224,10417.24,"When we funded it last year for this year it was serviced every four weeks so the initial pilot for the program was funded at 200,000, this proposes to add another hundred 75,000 but it does not seem, I am trying to get a sense, it doesn't really increase the frequency of the palm pilots it goes back to what we were previously doing before the reduction so I am trying to see if there are additional services being offered, if we are going to different locations,.",229,,
1116,0.97,10428.885,10451.34,During the public health emergency the utility expanded goals to provide increase hygiene services and apparently between July and August 1016 was averaging over 100 Pumpout per month.,229,,
1117,0.97,10451.407,10480.937,"So I am trying to get a sense of what the level of service is here beyond frequency . The number of locations and if there are additional services, same question for Rv mediation as well . It is previously funded to go to a certain number of locations, how many numbers of locations are we looking at now?",229,,
1118,0.97,10491.013,10506.295,Or the street SINKS Grance that were budgeted last year were awarded the contracts were in place by June of 2021.,230,,
1119,0.97,10506.362,10512.201,"Clean hands collective received $60,000 in Backscatter makers $40,000.",230,,
1120,0.97,10512.268,10527.583,"The status is at one sink has been deployed at the Plaza, clean hands collective will deploy up to 15 more unit this year.",230,,
1121,0.97,10527.65,10571.928,Several locations that met site requirements have declined adopting a sink due to staffing shortages at my concerns around being able to maintain the sink as far . real change reached out to over 110 locations in partnership and nine of those wo were interested were surveyed on the drainage compliance and five of those declined the SINKS due to gray water concerns.,230,,
1122,0.97,10571.994,10582.371,They did not fear that they could handle the Americans with disabilities act for access to the SINKS.,230,,
1123,0.97,10582.438,10586.242,The project is ongoing.,230,,
1124,0.97,10586.309,10629.018,Idea would be to increase or add an additional year of funding that would be consistent with the 2021 grant program but there have been soe significant impediments with finding partner sites for the SINKS . in terms of permanent toilets or bathroom facilities bathroom facilities in brick and mortar are the best providing these services.,230,,
1125,0.97,10629.085,10661.417,"Seattle does have say a significant number in their parks and recreation center sat during the pandemic were not available to the public but are increasingly available I am guessing perhaps counsel member Morales you are also talking about more permanent structures that are only hygiene stations, is that correct?",230,,
1126,0.97,10661.484,10679.902,"I in just looking for public bathrooms I am happy to send you photos from Vancouver Kamar Washington, Texas, where there are bolted down bathrooms for people to use as a are moving about the city.",231,,
1127,0.97,10679.969,10684.173,I want to make go back to Councilmember Lewis.,232,,
1128,0.97,10684.24,10689.211,Did you have more answers for those questions?,232,,
1129,0.97,10689.278,10694.25,We will look forward receiving those images with any further ideas.,233,,
1130,0.97,10694.316,10725.681,"To get back to the questions about the nature of the Army Pumpout services, yes, Spu is averaging, instead of the hundred that had been previously budgeted, it is 140 services per month so we have expanded the number of folks that we are reaching out to it back the number of Rvs.",233,,
1131,0.97,10725.748,10749.238,"This was in response to Covid- 19, we were pumping at four weeks for those we are serving, but, because we started to run out of money we tried to see if it would work at six weeks, it is not optimal for 40% of the folks that we are serving.",233,,
1132,0.97,10749.305,10754.176,It looks like every four weeks is the key spot.,233,,
1133,0.97,10754.243,10756.579,We would like to continue with the broader number.,233,,
1134,0.97,10760.449,10769.125,Did I answer the questions?,233,,
1135,0.97,10769.191,10773.829,Same question of Rv remediation visits that are proposed in this budget.,234,,
1136,0.97,10773.896,10780.102,I want to say thank you for adding the purple backpack pilot.,234,,
1137,0.97,10780.169,10810.399,Thank you for adding Rv locations to be recipients for that program as well . I would love to be able to compare what we funded as it relates to the numbers of Rvs Remediated per month under the previous budget to what you are proposing this year.,234,,
1138,0.97,10810.466,10833.222,"The one in terms of the Rv remediation work during Covid-19 all of the Rvs that remained, we have shifted, most of the emphasis cleans take an hour, we are able to do 10 sites per day.",234,,
1139,0.97,10833.289,10835.758,We can give you that total number later.,234,,
1140,0.97,10835.824,10842.264,I don't have it in my head.,234,,
1141,0.97,10842.331,10854.009,We have also tried this area as well expand the number of places that we can reach.,235,,
1142,0.97,10854.076,10854.41,Perfect.,236,,
1143,0.97,10854.476,10870.292,In the past the program did ask people to move in their Rvs when they were Rvs that were capable of moving so you could clean the entire area.,236,,
1144,0.97,10870.359,10883.739,"It also gave businesses, other folks in the community to have sort of a little bit of a break for a while.",236,,
1145,0.97,10883.806,10927.716,"I understand with the suspension of the 72 hour enforcement and some court cases that there is some complexity around enforcing parking laws, but, I would like us to think about how the remediation program, when we were asking people to move on, how it actually worked.",236,,
1146,0.97,10927.783,10936.158,We weren't really Towing people's vehicles . 90% of people moved voluntarily.,236,,
1147,0.97,10936.225,10967.589,"I would like to wonder, I would like to talk about if we could think about a Nonenforcement based approach that still gets people to move on for a little bit it back I will because again, it was successful in accomplishing that in the past without really having to ticket vehicles because so many people voluntarily complied.",236,,
1148,0.97,10967.656,10971.327,I am just putting that out there.,236,,
1149,0.97,10971.393,10987.576,Do you have any last comments?,237,,
1150,0.97,10995.718,10998.253,We welcome we are always willing to listen.,238,,
1151,0.97,10998.32,11003.992,Thank you very much for your time.,238,,
1152,0.97,11004.059,11013.936,Thank you for your I will turn it back over to you Councilmember.,239,,
1153,0.97,11014.002,11033.856,"Let's go back I appreciate the slide I appreciate this getting queued up, I think it is a good transition to the conversation with mark.",240,,
1154,0.97,11033.922,11044.933,One thing that we need to do is reconcile what the division of responsibility is going to be in the outreach realm.,240,,
1155,0.97,11045.0,11073.362,"I want us to be careful, I am flagging as an area, I think of intense scrutiny for this budget cycle is going to be figuring out what the hope team role is it back if it is appropriate to rename it to reflect this role.",240,,
1156,0.97,11073.429,11078.567,I am worried about inconsistency in outreach strategy.,240,,
1157,0.97,11078.634,11092.347,I am worried about people experiencing homelessness misunderstanding who is interacting with them and if there will be some outreach component in the hope team.,240,,
1158,0.97,11092.414,11149.304,"I want to make sure we are in a position where outreach, the outreach contracts, can do their thing without feeling like they are on a Timeline or a Countdown that has been imposed by the hope team for example hosting a removal . I think there is a role, I have talked to Jeff about this, how we sort of fun the things, I think there is a role for the city to have an enforcement position or even, I mean as he superintendent went into focus on making sure we are restoring spaces once the teams have finished their work and housed everybody in a location.",240,,
1159,0.97,11149.371,11165.988,I do worry about a position where we have outreach teams that are chafing up against the hope team's more enforcement things in my people perceive a Co- mingling of outreach which should be avoided.,240,,
1160,0.97,11166.054,11180.302,That is just a lot of things but I am wondering what is the vision in this budget of exactly what the hope team will be doing and how can we avoid the problems.,240,,
1161,0.97,11180.369,11184.873,It is a good can be go back to that slide.,241,,
1162,0.97,11184.94,11186.275,We should not even use the term hope team anymore.,241,,
1163,0.97,11186.341,11201.39,"There is no hope team because we are moving shelter, outreach which is a function of the hope team to the regional authority.",241,,
1164,0.97,11201.456,11206.929,It is just a misuse of words picked it is easier to look at roles.,241,,
1165,0.97,11206.995,11219.474,One thing to remember is earlier all the outreach providers refused to sign contracts.,241,,
1166,0.97,11219.541,11234.723,"It was about a three month thing . So we met with all of the providers and what they have said Wa we do not want to be on site the day of a removal, fair, right?",241,,
1167,0.97,11234.79,11238.293,We don't want to be there when a removal is posted.,241,,
1168,0.97,11238.36,11256.044,"In the navigation team, five years ago, they said the same thing, that is why we hired system navigators because someone has to be there on the day of the clean to offer shelter to the people who are left of there.",241,,
1169,0.97,11256.111,11282.237,"I just want to state that . mark and his team will have all the outreach providers is not all of the shelters, parks will be in charge, as they are now, I'm going to a site when all the folks have been referred to shelter to clean and restore its.",241,,
1170,0.97,11282.304,11286.341,The hope liaison role is one person.,241,,
1171,0.97,11286.408,11304.526,"In the budget, what we are doing is there is an outreach coordinator who will be loaned to the regional authority next year, the system navigators will be loaned to parks next year.",241,,
1172,0.97,11304.593,11331.486,"The only people staying is the one person who has to answer all of your questions, the community questions and help all of these buckets work together . effectively if you wanted to say in 2022 does the hope team go away?",241,,
1173,0.97,11331.553,11332.554,The answer is yes.,241,,
1174,0.97,11332.621,11350.505,The reason why the positions are loaned is to give time for mark and his team to work through the hiccups that will happen.,241,,
1175,0.97,11397.919,11405.961,Councilmember want to interrupt I also know there are some left over questions.,242,,
1176,0.97,11406.027,11410.732,"If you don't have anything, go ahead.",242,,
1177,0.97,11410.799,11416.805,I can wait.,243,,
1178,0.97,11416.872,11428.183,"Mark, that was a into helping us understand the Flowchart for next year.",244,,
1179,0.97,11428.25,11443.832,"I welcome you to the table and also recognize you are still in the process of setting up your team please go ahead and share a few comments with you, we do have about 20 minutes left.",244,,
1180,0.97,11443.899,11454.142,Thank you.,245,,
1181,0.97,11458.313,11482.971,I apologize the most important thing is I want to offer an appreciation to Julie and the team for walking with us during a very bizarre budget cycle.,246,,
1182,0.97,11483.038,11502.257,This is not how this was designed to work but I have a lot of gratitude for the support that we received in what could have been an incredibly painful process . Instead it was just a little weird.,246,,
1183,0.97,11502.324,11520.976,I also want to give appreciation for the the proposal as I think you all know most of you know my job is to say it is not enough so I will do that.,246,,
1184,0.97,11521.042,11528.183,"But, I still want to offer appreciation for the fact that we are starting above where we could have.",246,,
1185,0.97,11528.25,11537.058,The authorities priorities for 2022 are going to be continuing to ramp up.,246,,
1186,0.97,11537.125,11548.336,In particular we will be working in quarter one to develop the systemwide Rfp that will Rebid all of the contracts from top to bottom.,246,,
1187,0.97,11548.403,11562.25,We anticipating releasing that Rfp in quarter two and make award set when we turn the lights on in 23 it is a different system.,246,,
1188,0.97,11562.317,11575.196,My hope is that process leaves no room for surprises on how that is done.,246,,
1189,0.97,11575.263,11607.028,We want to have the appropriate conversation with the provider community with all of you as elected officials . The other priorities that we have are to respond to a crisis like it is a crisis.,246,,
1190,0.97,11607.095,11609.13,We have a number of initiatives we would like to get off the ground as soon as possible to,246,,
1191,0.97,11609.197,11644.933,"Egin to house we believe there are around 800 people living in the downtown area, we would like to get them how was fear it is really important that we be clear the fact that so many folks have to experience homelessness across Seattle has to be a core function of what we respond to.",247,,
1192,0.97,11645.0,11666.621,So we really want to do that essentially block by block neighborhood by neighborhood identifying an area and connecting with the folks in that area.,247,,
1193,0.97,11666.688,11679.901,I am appreciative of what the deputy said about the importance of the connection being made available for us to begin to direct outreach a month in advance.,247,,
1194,0.97,11679.968,11691.312,We have budgeted between 2-3 months by service planning.,247,,
1195,0.97,11691.379,11698.42,We think that is the amount of time it will take to do it's really well to make sure that we are matching people to the appropriate resources.,247,,
1196,0.97,11698.486,11730.285,"We are focused on navigation work as a Reframe of how outreach happens across the system, that work is based on Well- documented outcomes in the behavioral health space . We are really focused on making sure how people are traversing the system is held appropriately in a relationship framework.",247,,
1197,0.97,11730.351,11764.219,"The last thing that I will lift up is we have a focus on what we are referring to is high Acuity folks, folks who have a significant behavioral health or substance use issues, ensuring that those folks have access to shelter that has the appropriate level of care connected to it from a medical prospective.",247,,
1198,0.97,11764.285,11779.4,We are really looking for funding to be able to ramp up 150 beds of a high Acuity shelter in addition to the broader shelter initiatives.,247,,
1199,0.97,11779.467,11782.57,"I will stop, I apologize for being late.",247,,
1200,0.97,11782.637,11787.942,I welcome any questions in Righting cause more opportunities to meat with you one on one.,247,,
1201,0.97,11788.009,11807.529,I do know we but I will ask for folks to get those questions out then we do have a process for questions that don't get answered today to go through central staff . We will try to get as many as we can today.,248,,
1202,0.97,11807.595,11829.651,I have a there will plenty of time to talk about these things but I do want to set the stage and appreciate the deputy Mayor's answer on the future.,249,,
1203,0.97,11829.717,11855.41,"I have a question in terms of where is it going to reside, will it be in parks, when there is a decision that many areas will be flagged to go on the list that it will then say you have a month go to outreach, who is making those calls, how is that manifested in this architecture?",249,,
1204,0.97,11855.476,11902.257,"For now it will I don't personally think that that is ideal for parks for the entire city of Seattle but when the team was removed from the budget parks needed to pick it up, back in my day, so what we know to be true is someone in the city, it is parks for now, further discussion will be needed next year after we see how some of this works out.",250,,
1205,0.97,11902.323,11909.897,That will definitely something I want to get into more.,251,,
1206,0.97,11909.964,11914.235,If there is something close to removal of that is on a property is still residing with parks?,251,,
1207,0.97,11914.302,11926.247,"Yes, because Seattle contracts with parks to do that.",252,,
1208,0.97,11926.314,11932.52,Given this is an interest the authority is interested in participating actively in how that work gets done.,253,,
1209,0.97,11932.587,11950.505,We have had this conversation with the deputy Mayor I believe we agreed that there needs to be a clear policy language between how scheduling is done at my County authority works it.,253,,
1210,0.97,11950.571,11958.046,Sphere great spirit I will make space,253,,
1211,0.97,11958.112,11966.387,Great I will others to ask a question.,254,,
1212,0.97,11966.454,11988.91,"There has the work that clean 60s is doing in parks, we have advocates, people who are how list, people concerned that people's belongings are being moved without consent.",255,,
1213,0.97,11988.976,11997.652,Removing tents without effort to Confim that they have been abandoned.,255,,
1214,0.97,11997.719,12001.923,I understand there is some perspective that there needs to be enforcement.,255,,
1215,0.97,12001.989,12012.9,"I do think it is important to acknowledge that that should not be happening in parks, that the Department shouldn't be there in that role.",255,,
1216,0.97,12012.967,12026.247,I am wondering if central staff can tell me which line item this false item because it is not clear in this presentation.,255,,
1217,0.97,12026.314,12042.964,My last question is there seems to be confusion around counsel and service provider's goals for the hope team so I want to clear that up.,255,,
1218,0.97,12043.03,12043.998,This was never intended to be about enforcement.,255,,
1219,0.97,12044.065,12100.588,"My staff, other Council members, spent time last summer with service providers, with the deputy Mayor, with others to close of the navigation team and stand up the hope team, which is a reminder, it was about homeless outreach and a provider echo system, the goal of that program was to build a collaborative system between the city of my providers to give providers more control about input on whether is an encampment should removed so this is really about centering the people who are experiencing homelessness.",255,,
1220,0.97,12103.157,12113.1,My question related to that is if we Hve a sense of how many encampment Removals in parks were supported by contract service providers in 2021.,255,,
1221,0.97,12113.167,12116.304,I have some other questions but I will direct them to central staff.,255,,
1222,0.97,12125.313,12148.202,Since we just I have not yet been able to do a deep dive because it is a combination of existing expenditures along with the new so I will have to get back to you with that information.,256,,
1223,0.97,12148.269,12150.972,We will also have to back to you on that second question.,257,,

1245,0.97,12493.781,12541.028,"I want to mention that one of the ideas, it is my understanding that one of the Reasns this is a challenging population to convince to move out of their Rvs into another type of housing, permanent housing, is the Rv is the most precious asset that they own .
