Just four months ago, a jury spoke and the Seattle Olice did precisely what they were trained to do when they shot Charleena Lyles seven times in front of her children . The jury did not find the killing correct or morally justified or without alternative . They found the officers acted according to Seattle city training and policy . two years after George Floyd, the budget of the Council is proposing more money for the police and wastes over $11 million on a police accountability system that still has police investigating police . This is $11 million denying the victims of police violence any appeals or semblance of justice or accountable . If this Council can't provide accountability and end the unnecessarily killings, at the least they can Ameliorate the harm the training creates . provide money to support the victims of police violence and families in order to address the harms that you have allowed to continue support the request that the budget address the needs of families impacted by police violence . You planned spending $11 million to perpetuate the facade of police accountability . can you not allow a fraction of that heal the harms they have created?",13,,

I'm encouraging you to support the one-time $455,000 to help fund the development of a Community-Led resilience Hub on the campus of Bethany United Methodist Church . They ever raised more than $250,000 to begin work and the one-time funding would fully fund the completion of this project, which would weather rise and Decarbonize all the buildings on the Bethany campus, and create a Hub for the community, providing shelter during extreme weather events and other emergencies such as earthquakes . This demonstrates how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, centering environmental justice .

Sometimes survivors get blamed for this and people ask, why would you choose to stay in an abusive relationship .

I feel the visual plight of graffiti in this city is a direct result of lack of investment in community . that's basically the size of it . If we look at the spaces we are creating for cultural investment, historical investment and artistic investment, we can find a Pathway towards incorporating artists and community, and incorporating historical acknowledgment, and find a Pathway that brings about touch points in the city that people can build around versus blank walls and emptiness .

I have used this for supplies and books and anything else I needed to continue school .

I can't believe the city council would want to take this option away when students really need the assistance . I'm not familiar with the city Council and politics but I know there are probably other options and other places to get the funds rather than take it from students who need it, students like myself . a majority of students in college are not wealthy .

We already have the tool we need to ensure that the rich, not ordinary people, pay for this crisis, that is the Amazon tax . and through our people's budget movement and--I think it is shameful that not one of the Council Democrats have spoken in favor of increasing the Amazon tax to fill shortfalls but instead will vote yes on cutting funds for affordable housing, green new deal measures, tiny home villages, and inflation-adjusted wages for city workers, and to further put the cost of the crisis on the shoulders of ordinary people by creating increasingly Regressive car taxes which further squeeze working people and especially vulnerable communities .

We cannot Underfund the shelter workers, case managers, and other human service providers who are charged with the critical belief to our neighbors . The Mayor's proposed budget does this while offering millions in additional funding for a unified care team responsible for destructive and timid Sweeps shows a serious inversion of priorities .

I also want to express our gratitude to the city for its commitment to being a welcoming city to all communities, including the many immigrant and refugee communities that reside and work in the city . one of the ways the city acts on the value of being a welcoming community is through programs that support community members on the Pathway to be a United States citizen . The city partners with the state of Washington in the new citizens program which provides vital services to community members to access U.S. citizenship . I want to thank Councilmember Mosqueda for sponsoring an amendment that would support a modest increase in funding of this program and make sure that the level of services remain constant in the coming year . that amendment number is 001-A .

There were not enough shelter beds for people currently being displaced . The majority of residents are still outside but in different areas with fewer resources than before since SPD tries a lot of their stuff and outreach workers need funding to stop the Sweeps . Council can restore pay for Council--Similarly, council can restore food funding, increase shelter, and it is needed for a budget for people to live, instead of a budget which will result in death .
