14,0.97,164.097,177.11,"A reminder to my colleagues and the public, the legislation does not assess a final plan for the use of the Red barn ranch nor does it assess new ownership of the property.",2,,
15,0.97,177.11,186.719,It is a technical step by simply removing the Covenant on the property for future discussion of use and ownership.,2,,
16,0.97,186.719,192.025,I'm glad to see so many people have written to us about the future of this property.,2,,

47,0.97,415.214,416.849,This is Isaac.,10,,
48,0.97,416.849,426.025,"I just wanted to call in to voice support, is this a good time to speak?",10,,
49,0.97,426.025,428.995,"It is good, you've got two minutes.",11,,
50,0.97,428.995,439.572,I just wanted to call on the Council today to support the transfer of the Red barn ranch.,12,,
51,0.97,439.572,450.383,I think for city council that has no lack representation it's imperative for the Council to take immediate action to directly invest in the black community.,12,,
52,0.97,450.383,462.028,There are very little opportunities that make as much sense as immediately transferring red barn ranch to Nurturing roots and black farmers prospectively.,12,,
53,0.97,462.028,485.985,"This is 40 acres that has a history of being gifted to the city by a black individual, it is currently vacant and is being underutilized in the city Council has done far too little 2020 and 2021 in terms of actually doing real investments for the black community.",12,,
54,0.97,485.985,494.026,And it actually falls on the policy decisions and actions of the city council.,12,,
55,0.97,494.026,507.406,You have the authority right now to Supersede the Seattle parks Department and transfer this party over to Nurturing roots who has been advocating for this land for over a year and has had thousands upon thousands of community engagement and support.,12,,
56,0.97,507.406,525.024,"So the question is really on city Council to be on their conscience, why not make immediate actions right now to transfer this property to Nurturing roots and black farmers, via removing the restrictive Covenant.",12,,
57,0.97,525.024,535.635,"When you think of black wealth being zero, these focuses that are on the Council, you all bear the responsibility and reality I hope you all do the right thing.",12,,
58,0.97,535.635,542.875,"Sir, I did not want to stop you, maybe you did not hear the Eginning of the instructions.",13,,
59,0.97,542.875,553.085,Your comments regarding the Red barn ranch should actually come up when we get to item number four and we have a public hearing on that.,13,,
60,0.97,553.085,560.96,"I don't know if you want to call back, maybe that clerk can advise us if we take note of that.",13,,
61,0.97,560.96,566.499,"And today, we are just lifting the recreational Covenant.",13,,
62,0.97,566.499,573.272,There is no boat about a transfer of the land or ownership or use yet.,13,,
63,0.97,573.272,574.507,That is way down the line.,13,,
64,0.97,574.507,575.908,So how do we do this clerk?,13,,
65,0.97,575.908,589.589,Do we have the gentleman call back at the appropriate time per the instructions I stated on the outset or do we just NOTE for the record that he made the comments now in regards to item number four.,13,,
66,0.97,589.589,599.932,"We can note that he spoke right now, if he wants to hold on the line until the public hearing comes up, he is welcome to do that but does not have to.",14,,
67,0.97,599.932,602.335,"Sir, did you hear those instructions?",15,,
68,0.97,602.335,605.905,Okay well then we will just keep going then.,15,,
69,0.97,605.905,606.138,Yes.,16,,
70,0.97,606.138,618.951,"We had given instructions for the public hearing on the Red barn ranch when we get to item number four, but that is not what we are doing right now.",16,,
71,0.97,618.951,621.654,We are just doing public comment on the rest of the agenda.,16,,
72,0.97,621.654,626.425,So we can take your comments now or you can call back if you want to again we get to item number four.,16,,
73,0.97,626.425,629.929,But thank you for calling in.,16,,
74,0.97,629.929,641.874,Next we have name of Clark and please speak to the general comments on the agenda when your time starts.,17,,
75,0.97,641.874,647.88,"Thank you, may I begin?",18,,
76,0.97,647.88,648.948,Yes.,19,,
77,0.97,648.948,659.692,"Good afternoon, unfortunately I can't see anyone, my name is Naima Clark and I am a community member located in Seattle Washington.",20,,
78,0.97,659.692,670.002,"I was born in South Seattle, and there was a large opportunity for a lot of recreation but not a lot of recreation activities for farming.",20,,
79,0.97,670.002,680.379,My specific reason for calling in is to highlight the ambitions of community to get behind this process.,20,,
80,0.97,680.379,699.899,"I would love for the city or Councilmembers to perhaps dwell upon the fact that a lot of community called in and Emailed, over 1000 Emails in order to support the acquisition of the Red barn.",20,,
81,0.97,701.3,702.935,This first step of that is the Covenant.,20,,
82,0.97,702.935,705.337,So I appreciate the fact that this has come to Council Hill.,20,,
83,0.97,705.337,711.043,I want to lift up the voices of community members that actually identify with this Covenant being transferred is a viable solution to the land being restored.,20,,
84,0.97,711.043,713.646,A lot of our community support has gone into advocating and calling.,20,,
85,0.97,713.646,724.356,"There have been a lot of folks, Christopher, Max, Selena, that we have talked to about the idea of this Covenant coming away or being transferred to a new parcel.",20,,
86,0.97,724.356,729.762,A lot of that right now seems to benefit parks in the city.,20,,
87,0.97,729.762,736.569,I believe the community is being left off is almost nonexistent in the process.,20,,
88,0.97,736.569,746.846,Or being silenced in a way that doesn't necessarily stand behind the original voices that perpetuated this motion of the Covenant being transferred.,20,,
89,0.97,746.846,749.782,"The city Council, parks Department has not done anything with this land for years.",20,,
90,0.97,749.782,760.092,"Now that there is a new parcel of higher value that can be governed by the city, we are hoping that a rural area you will consider as a viable solution to our ask.",20,,
91,0.97,760.092,772.538,"I am in support of the Covenant being transferred with, again, the institutional grace Olivia asked for when we spoke to Christopher.",20,,
92,0.97,772.538,774.707,Maybe I was not clear in my opening comments and direction.,21,,
93,0.97,774.707,784.617,We are not addressing the Red barn ranch during public comment right now.,21,,
94,0.97,784.617,789.889,"We will have a public hearing on the Red barn ranch when we get to item number four, we will have an official public hearing.",21,,
95,0.97,789.889,806.739,"As the gentleman before, I thank you for your word so we will just note that your comments were to item number four, but I caution the other callers on the line, if you are calling about the Red barn ranch, this is not the time.",21,,
96,0.97,806.739,809.775,We need to talk about the other items on the agenda for public comment.,21,,
97,0.97,809.775,814.513,"But when we get to item number four, which is the official public hearing on red barn ranch, that's when we need your comments.",21,,
98,0.97,814.513,816.115,I understand Maybe there has been some confusion.,21,,
99,0.97,816.115,823.355,So clerk we will do the same thing again as we did with caller number one.,21,,
100,0.97,823.355,825.024,We will NOTE it for the record.,21,,
101,0.97,825.024,830.763,"If you want to stay on the line and speak again when we get to item number four are the official public hearing, you are welcome to do that.",21,,
102,0.97,830.763,843.342,"With that, again, please, if you are calling about the Red barn ranch, wait until we get to item number new four, and today we are not transferring any land.",21,,
103,0.97,843.342,845.277,All we are doing is lifting the recreational Covenant.,21,,
104,0.97,845.277,848.28,"We are not discussing the use, that is way down the line.",21,,
105,0.97,848.28,851.183,Can you call the next two names?,21,,
106,0.97,851.183,857.756,I have noted the first two callers to be transferred to the public hearing list.,22,,
107,0.97,857.756,864.396,"The next item for the general public comment period, we have David Haynes.",22,,
108,0.97,864.396,869.168,"David, are you on?",22,,
109,0.97,869.168,870.402,"Yes, thank you.",23,,
110,0.97,870.402,889.121,"City Council, I find it highly suspect in the offensive that the city council sarcastically tells the community how much was trash is picked up every week.",23,,
111,0.97,889.121,899.732,"Please stop announcing that city Council, because those needles are passed out by a church charges rent.",23,,
112,0.97,899.732,907.239,"So anyone who drops of that drug paraphernalia, right next to the Childrens shelter.",23,,
113,0.97,907.239,908.54,We need better resource and outreach.,23,,
114,0.97,908.54,921.32,"I hate to say this, but that land you are all talking about and trying to grab again that was meant specifically for particular purposes of the public is not supposed to go into private hands.",23,,
115,0.97,921.32,927.459,"We need that for the homeless a crisis with community outreach, service officers on site with 24/7 outreach.",23,,
116,0.97,927.459,930.362,Get people on the proper path.,23,,
117,0.97,930.362,939.104,"You to stop pushing the drug pushers, but please stop announcing how much trash you picked up.",23,,
118,0.97,939.104,944.677,Why don't you just have the unions show up with trash service every week instead of blaming and judging the homeless.,23,,
119,0.97,944.677,952.051,You act like we are the criminals and we throw all that treasure instead of junkies making a mess of everything.,23,,
120,0.97,952.051,962.695,You have to have the same weekly trash pickup that you have for the rest of the community without making announcements about it.,23,,
121,0.97,962.695,969.401,Please.,23,,

284,0.97,2177.608,2182.413,And transforming this into red barn ranch.,72,,

286,0.97,2207.338,2225.056,So I fully support Uplifting this restrictive Covenant that Unfortunately means there is some type of layers of bureaucracy that Nurturing roots would have to go through in order for them to get this property.,72,,
287,0.97,2225.056,2239.036,I think Seattle as a city has the opportunity to lead with these kinds of direct actions that mean direct community.,72,,
288,0.97,2239.036,2250.381,"And when we talk about it being in your hands, this is one action you can take as a collective counsel to say you know what, we understand the need for this in the community and we oblige that need.",72,,
289,0.97,2250.381,2266.297,Because we do have to find innovative ways to move forward from so much restrictive covenants like this one that would keep,72,,

293,0.97,2391.789,2395.259,I am in full support of removing the restrictive Covenant.,73,,
294,0.97,2395.259,2415.746,"One other thing I'd like to add, that the agenda that was published for this particular meeting had only one item, so I would ask the committee staff, there are four items on the agenda, then the public should be able to see those four items.",73,,

327,0.97,2622.052,2634.064,"Thank you chair Juarez, we've got several folks from parks and recreation here so I will let the two folks that will help me out with the first item introduce themselves.",85,,
328,0.97,2634.064,2637.568,We will introduce the others as we go along.,85,,
329,0.97,2637.568,2639.67,Selena we will start with you.,85,,
330,0.97,2639.67,2642.072,"Hi everyone, I'm part of the policy team.",86,,
331,0.97,2642.072,2659.123,"Good afternoon, Max Jacob from the Seattle parks and Rec real estate.",87,,
332,0.97,2661.925,2672.469,"I'm looking at the history on this Jesus, it looks like the city but this way back in 1970.",88,,
333,0.97,2672.469,2676.974,That is correct.,89,,
334,0.97,2676.974,2679.076,"Okay, can folks see the screen?",89,,
335,0.97,2679.076,2695.492,"Okay, well thank you again, as we get started I want to acknowledge and express my appreciation for all the folks who came to testify today and all the folks who have been advocating on behalf of of a new use for this property.",90,,
336,0.97,2695.492,2700.631,Particularly for Nurturing roots.,90,,
337,0.97,2700.631,2712.643,"And really, appreciate the advocacy that they are sharing in terms of supporting black forming and investing in the community.",90,,
338,0.97,2712.643,2718.615,Obviously this really helps us and pushes us to explore different possibilities for the site and really about creative uses.,90,,
339,0.97,2718.615,2719.65,We appreciate that very much.,90,,
340,0.97,2719.65,2732.629,"And as you said, the idea here is obviously procedural to some extent, to clear the way so we can begin with some more creative thinking.",90,,
341,0.97,2732.629,2734.798,The next steps for this property have not been identified.,90,,
342,0.97,2734.798,2743.173,But again we do appreciate the ongoing advocacy and collaboration.,90,,
343,0.97,2743.173,2756.487,"Just to give folks a little bit of a geographic awareness, this is a property just under 40 acres.",90,,
344,0.97,2756.487,2763.26,"South east of Seattle near Auburn, about 30 miles southeast of Seattle.",90,,
345,0.97,2763.26,2788.852,"On the map you can see, it should've show you, you can see that White square, there are some structures in the top left and then there is some Forested land and Wetland areas, so it is a Bitty pretty big piece of property.",90,,
346,0.97,2788.852,2790.02,It is largely an open space.,90,,
347,0.97,2790.02,2800.931,"In terms of some of the historical context, as you said Councilmember, the city did in fact purchase this property in 1970.",90,,
348,0.97,2800.931,2803.133,And that is part of the reason why we are here.,90,,
349,0.97,2803.133,2811.308,The way in which the city acquired this property was utilizing funding from the acquisition office.,90,,
350,0.97,2811.308,2822.352,Whenever we purchase land we accept these grants with the requirement of placing restrictive covenants on the property as being purchased.,90,,
351,0.97,2822.352,2831.929,Those restrictive covenants require us to keep the landing use for parks and recreation and continue to provide public access.,90,,
352,0.97,2831.929,2840.237,So this property has been with us for many years and has been using various different ways.,90,,
353,0.97,2840.237,2850.28,Most recently there has been camps on the property.,90,,
354,0.97,2850.28,2862.726,And then they vacated back in 2018.,90,,
355,0.97,2862.726,2865.295,So then we try to identify what we can do with this property.,90,,
356,0.97,2865.295,2871.501,Some very practical and pragmatic challenges is where the property is and how much work is required.,90,,
357,0.97,2871.501,2878.909,Then we began the conversations with the conservation office about what we can do with the property.,90,,
358,0.97,2878.909,2883.513,Conversation started way back in 2018.,90,,
359,0.97,2883.513,2888.218,In the property has been vacant since then.,90,,
360,0.97,2888.218,2895.225,"Just a quick overview, this restrictive Covenant comes with a funding source.",90,,
361,0.97,2895.225,2904.334,"Therefore, in order for us to do anything different with this property, we would have to remove the Covenant.",90,,
362,0.97,2904.334,2906.203,And that is what we are asking for approval.,90,,
363,0.97,2906.203,2916.38,"If we don't remove the covenants, the what we can do on this property is very minimal.",90,,
364,0.97,2916.38,2920.017,Without it we would not be able to do anything.,90,,
365,0.97,2920.017,2946.043,"It is also important to note that in addition to these covenants strict in the use currently, another step as part of this process would be to take a look at initiative 42, which Councilmembers, you should know, but for the public, it is an initiative that requires any property within the parks and recreation to be utilized for parks and recreation usage.",90,,
366,0.97,2946.043,2955.485,"If the property is to be disposed of, there is some very specific requirements in terms of replacement.",90,,
367,0.97,2955.485,2960.791,"So there are lots of reasons why, we will get into it more deeply.",90,,
368,0.97,2960.791,2964.394,So there are many reasons why proposition 42 does not really work.,90,,
369,0.97,2964.394,2973.704,We expected to be coming back to you all to address that.,90,,
370,0.97,2973.704,2983.013,And then be able to move forward to set missions for this.,90,,
371,0.97,2983.013,2985.682,But more to come on that.,90,,
372,0.97,2985.682,2994.825,And so part of the process to remove the Covenant was first getting approval from the recreation conservation office.,90,,
373,0.97,2994.825,2995.926,We started this back in 2018.,90,,
374,0.97,2995.926,3000.33,In January we were able to get approval from the Rcl board to remove those covenants.,90,,
375,0.97,3000.33,3007.704,But in order to remove them we have to put them somewhere else.,90,,
376,0.97,3007.704,3014.711,And that is where the North Regnier land Bakes come into play.,90,,
377,0.97,3014.711,3022.619,It has to be a piece of property that has not yet been developed and there are very few that qualify for this.,90,,
378,0.97,3022.619,3026.456,The North Regnier property is really the only one.,90,,
379,0.97,3026.456,3052.783,"We have one other but that has been identified for other covenants so the other reason why this property, the North Rainier site makes sense, it is a site we are ready seeking additional Rcl money for, so there will be covenants on that property.",90,,
380,0.97,3052.783,3056.753,This is a great opportunity for us to take advantage of that.,90,,
381,0.97,3056.753,3077.674,So we are going to ask you to release the existing Covenant deed on the Red barn property and move forward with the North Rainier property.,90,,
382,0.97,3077.674,3079.109,The timing on this is important.,90,,
383,0.97,3079.109,3083.647,"In order to transfer the covenants to a new property, that cannot yet be developed.",90,,
384,0.97,3083.647,3086.817,The North Rainier is one of our properties that is moving forward.,90,,
385,0.97,3086.817,3092.589,And they plan to move forward with that development this summer.,90,,
386,0.97,3092.589,3101.598,So would like to move the covenants over so we don't slow that down.,90,,
387,0.97,3101.598,3124.321,"To back up just a tiny bit, to show folks where the earth Regnier property is, this is sort of like an acquisition we made, and will build a park about 38,000 square feet.",90,,
388,0.97,3124.321,3127.624,"That is an acre, right?",91,,
389,0.97,3127.624,3131.061,"Yes, just under an acre.",92,,
390,0.97,3131.061,3131.661,Next slide.,92,,
391,0.97,3131.661,3142.172,"And as we stated several times, this is just the first step in order for us to create some flexibility to do something different with the Red barn ranch property.",92,,
392,0.97,3142.172,3153.45,"Once we remove the covenants, we've already begun engaging to help understand what needs to be done with this property for future use.",92,,
393,0.97,3153.45,3159.489,So we have to have a better sense of what the future use is.,92,,
394,0.97,3159.489,3177.707,"Ultimately, we would plan on designing and implementing this community envisioned process that would identify long term use and work with a consultant to figure out what will happen with the property.",92,,
395,0.97,3177.707,3187.817,Again we have to figure out what we need to do to move forward.,92,,
396,0.97,3187.817,3199.629,"And I mentioned with initiative 42, there are also further resources that can be invested.",92,,
397,0.97,3199.629,3202.332,"For example if we needed to invest from the park district, for example.",92,,
398,0.97,3202.332,3206.636,So some legal analysis and legal work still has to happen.,92,,
399,0.97,3206.636,3209.139,But this is the first step we are asking for today.,92,,
400,0.97,3209.139,3235.966,"And on the last slide, just asking you all to help us transfer this Covenant from red barn ranch to the North Rainier site allows us to have more options and allows us to continue the development for the North Rainier site.",92,,
401,0.97,3235.966,3240.303,I will be happy to answer any questions.,92,,
402,0.97,3240.303,3250.347,"Thank you for the Powerpoint, I also had a chance to go through the summary and the fiscal legislation.",93,,
403,0.97,3250.347,3275.105,"And I do appreciate it, we've got many letters that advocate in the use of this property in the future so I know you're Powerpoint has shown that the city has bought this in 1970 and it was just another technical piece in removing the Covenant.",93,,
404,0.97,3275.105,3296.426,"So, I'm going to open up the floor and see if there's anything else for my colleagues are anyone that wants to share information or ask any questions of the superintendent, Selena or Max.",93,,
405,0.97,3296.426,3307.937,One of the things I heard folks speak to in the public hearing is a desire and desire for there to be a reflection in the public record.,94,,
406,0.97,3307.937,3323.353,I think what I was hearing sort of reflection not just in the public record but in the testimony and in our actions we are Takng about the interest in transferring the property to Nurturing roots.,94,,
407,0.97,3323.353,3331.828,"Specifically supporting the vision for creating a space for black farming, a healing space and youth empowerment on the property.",94,,
408,0.97,3331.828,3345.275,"I really appreciate the work that they've been doing at Nurturing roots, and in meeting with parks and recreation regularly since last year.",94,,
409,0.97,3345.275,3350.88,"We've received hundreds, maybe thousands of Emails encouraging this transfer.",94,,
410,0.97,3350.88,3364.994,"I'm just wondering, is there a way that we can Memorialize this interest in our legislative action?",94,,
411,0.97,3364.994,3388.084,"Just, in order to respect and honor the engagement and efforts of community members, and their work to really have brought us as far as we have.",94,,
412,0.97,3388.084,3391.154,I can answer that as a lawyer but I will let the superintendent.,95,,
413,0.97,3391.154,3394.624,Today is just technically to remove the Covenant.,95,,
414,0.97,3394.624,3411.941,"I assume from the Powerpoint in my discussions with the superintendent, we have a long public process ahead of us and we can certainly discuss resolutions honoring and voicing the concerns and interest of the group.",95,,
415,0.97,3411.941,3424.921,"And you are right, we have received hundreds of letters from the Nurturing roots organization and other folks.",95,,
416,0.97,3424.921,3436.232,"But I should be candor, there are other groups interested in this property as well, including some tribes.",95,,
417,0.97,3436.232,3439.102,"I guess this is why we have this, this is just the first step.",95,,
418,0.97,3439.102,3443.273,So now it's free and open.,95,,
419,0.97,3443.273,3455.485,"Answer initiative 42 issues that we have to do and then we will start the process, the whole public process with the person that Jesus and them hired.",95,,
420,0.97,3455.485,3463.993,"You hired a third-party to come in, and that we won't start the public process there.",95,,
421,0.97,3463.993,3474.804,"And I think there will be plenty of opportunity for us to entertain resolutions for Reticular groups and address some of the issues you said, to honor the voices and about their main concerns.",95,,
422,0.97,3474.804,3479.909,But we are not doing that today about use.,95,,
423,0.97,3479.909,3484.614,That's why we are being very clear about it.,95,,
424,0.97,3484.614,3486.115,Right now it's just about lifting the Covenant.,95,,
425,0.97,3486.115,3487.383,Anything want to add superintendent?,95,,
426,0.97,3487.383,3487.784,Thank you.,96,,
427,0.97,3487.784,3496.826,I just want to clarify the consultant we engaged with is only on the physical property itself in terms of what work needs to be done.,96,,
428,0.97,3496.826,3501.998,We have not had discussions about future use.,96,,
429,0.97,3501.998,3519.148,We have had lots of discussion with other agencies to help us understand the legal hurdles as well as opportunities for community and Visioning process . that will get us to start asking those next series of questions.,96,,
430,0.97,3519.148,3523.553,When will the consultant be able to get back to us?,97,,
431,0.97,3523.553,3525.054,What is the deliverable from your consultant?,97,,
432,0.97,3525.054,3543.806,"We've had one consultant that engaged and looked at the existing buildings to give us information, but what useful life is left in any of these buildings, some of them they are clearly recommending they be demolished.",98,,
433,0.97,3543.806,3546.843,The challenge we have is that we have that data but we need another round.,98,,
434,0.97,3546.843,3555.952,That second round of information really is dependent on what we anticipate the next used to be.,98,,
435,0.97,3555.952,3562.358,So we sort of have to do these two things together.,98,,
436,0.97,3562.358,3568.364,And then we can bring the consultant on as we get to that.,98,,
437,0.97,3568.364,3572.535,So I don't have a deliverable anymore.,98,,
438,0.97,3572.535,3580.109,The report in hand will give us some very facility specific items to do.,98,,
439,0.97,3580.109,3589.652,"And that was really if we have this property ourselves, what would need to happen to make it safe and viable to keep the property.",98,,
440,0.97,3589.652,3593.222,We've had these issues before where we've gotten Roperty and there has been structures on the property.,99,,
441,0.97,3593.222,3599.128,In this property has been vacant for three years.,99,,
442,0.97,3599.128,3602.031,"There will be some structural issues, some safety issues, like we've done before.",99,,
443,0.97,3602.031,3606.202,We had flooding issues and other pieces of property where people said why can't you just give it to us.,99,,
444,0.97,3606.202,3618.548,"We can just do that, there's liability issues and you can just build housing there.",99,,
445,0.97,3618.548,3622.018,There are also a lot of other acts in laws.,99,,
446,0.97,3622.018,3626.122,"This was bought in 1970 for a purpose, I'm guessing that it outgrew that purpose.",99,,
447,0.97,3626.122,3630.693,Looks like the county didn't want it.,99,,
448,0.97,3630.693,3631.027,King County.,99,,
449,0.97,3631.027,3633.763,So this is why we are moving forward just to remove the Covenant.,99,,
450,0.97,3633.763,3643.773,"But I do appreciate your sentiments and what you are trying to establish Councilmember Herbold, and there certainly will be time for that.",99,,
451,0.97,3643.773,3655.184,I wasn't suggesting any amendments to the legislation that predetermined any use of the property.,100,,
452,0.97,3655.184,3666.729,I recognize we would not be discussing lifting the Covenant if it were not for the interest of the community in this piece of property.,100,,
453,0.97,3666.729,3678.041,There is a recital in the ordinance that talks about the city exploring the options for the future use of the Red barn property including the potential transfer to an outside entity.,101,,
454,0.97,3678.041,3687.083,So I think there is a nodded their and that very broad and vague language and the fact that they will look at a potential transfer.,101,,
455,0.97,3687.083,3691.22,"But again, not at the specific level.",101,,
456,0.97,3691.22,3699.128,But perhaps it is predetermined at this point.,101,,
457,0.97,3699.128,3705.134,"Any other questions, Councilmember Peterson?",102,,
458,0.97,3705.134,3708.004,Thank you chair Juarez.,103,,
459,0.97,3708.004,3716.913,This question is either for parks or central staff.,103,,
460,0.97,3716.913,3733.062,Does the state law or agreement when you are getting rid of the restrictive covenants for recreation and we have a 38 acre property currently here and then transferring it to about one acre.,103,,
461,0.97,3733.062,3737.834,Is there any sort of equivalency requirement?,103,,
462,0.97,3737.834,3740.636,I just want to make sure we are abiding by what the state requires.,103,,
463,0.97,3740.636,3750.48,"That is a great question, there is a consideration for value.",104,,
464,0.97,3750.48,3757.954,"And what happens here is that we have 40 acres that are in King County, not in the city of Seattle.",104,,
465,0.97,3757.954,3762.592,The North Rainier site is much Mre valuable.,104,,
466,0.97,3762.592,3768.397,So that's why we went to the recreation office.,104,,
467,0.97,3768.397,3771.667,"Once they agree to it, then we will be fine.",104,,
468,0.97,3771.667,3773.069,That's what they have to tell us.,104,,
469,0.97,3773.069,3774.203,Whether it's a comparable exchange.,104,,
470,0.97,3774.203,3786.716,I don't know if that answers your question.,104,,
471,0.97,3786.716,3787.316,"Yes, thank you.",105,,
472,0.97,3787.316,3790.753,"Okay if there are no further questions, we can move to a vote.",106,,
473,0.97,3790.753,3802.331,In order to vote on a final recommendation we first need to suspend that counsel role relating to voting a registration on the same day of public hearing is held.,106,,
474,0.97,3802.331,3812.642,If there is no objection that counsel will relate to final recommendations on the same days public hearing is suspended.,106,,
475,0.97,3812.642,3815.144,"Hearing no objection, the rule is suspended.",106,,
476,0.97,3815.144,3821.984,We will now proceed with the vote.,106,,
477,0.97,3821.984,3829.158,I move that the committee recommend passage of counsel bill 120048.,106,,
478,0.97,3829.158,3831.027,"There has been a second, any more comments?",106,,
479,0.97,3831.027,3838.234,Will the clerk please call the roll?,106,,
480,0.97,3838.234,3855.151,"[roll call] five in favor, none opposed.",107,,
481,0.97,3855.151,3861.757,That passes and the committee's action will go to full Council on Monday.,108,,
482,0.97,3861.757,3862.358,All right.,108,,
483,0.97,3862.358,3870.366,"Let's move into item number five, Seattle, I'm sorry, this is all about parking.",108,,
484,0.97,3870.366,3879.208,Parks and Rec and public school but why don't you read it into the record.,108,,
485,0.97,3879.208,3903.633,"Bill 120033, authorizing the superintendent of parks and recreation to execute on behalf of the city of Seattle, of right of entry license agreement concerning Helen medicine pull in the life teen center and pool.",109,,
486,0.97,3903.633,3917.346,"So I'm guessing we have the same Presenters, if they can introduce themselves before you begin the presentation.",110,,
487,0.97,3919.415,3919.949,Thank you.,111,,
488,0.97,3919.949,3926.355,In the superintendent of the Seattle parks and recreation.,111,,
489,0.97,3926.355,3940.503,For this we will have Lisa ward as well.,112,,
490,0.97,3940.803,3949.378,"This is a really exciting Powerpoint, I just want to let you know.",113,,
491,0.97,3949.378,3954.283,There are six pages of Riveting information.,113,,
492,0.97,3954.283,3961.324,"I will jump in, and thank you again for sharing the presentation.",114,,
493,0.97,3961.324,3965.861,"This is exciting, it is certainly important to us and exciting to the school district.",114,,
494,0.97,3965.861,3977.94,"But as you stated, we are here to request approval for a license that allows us to share parking with the public schools.",114,,
495,0.97,3977.94,3987.516,"And as you know Council members, we do a lot of facility sharing with the school district across the city with fields and buildings.",114,,
496,0.97,3987.516,4002.264,This is a little different because it does not fall within the agreement because it is much more about our own facility operational requirements and requires a different model.,114,,
497,0.97,4002.264,4023.252,"The first slide, this sort of captures the overview, we have a situation that on the North part of town the medicine pool has parking adjacent to Ingram high school that is limited to no parking.",114,,
498,0.97,4023.252,4033.362,Then we have the Southwest teen life center pool with no parking and then the compound with lots of parking.,114,,
499,0.97,4033.362,4036.632,So they share these facilities and we've done so for I believe decades at this point.,114,,
500,0.97,4036.632,4039.902,This is just a renewal of an existing relationship.,114,,
501,0.97,4039.902,4050.646,"On the North end, Ingram high school students would use the medicine pool parking lot during the school days.",114,,
502,0.97,4050.646,4066.095,And then the Southwest side of the city would use the pool parking.,114,,
503,0.97,4066.095,4072.301,Think flakes no where they are.,114,,
504,0.97,4072.301,4079.308,This shows the relation between Ingraham and medicine.,114,,
505,0.97,4079.308,4094.09,"It is pretty compact, and the little Invertedl there is the parking lot that belongs to parks and recreation that is attached to the medicine pool.",114,,
506,0.97,4094.09,4096.592,On the right you see the parking lot in the picture.,114,,
507,0.97,4096.592,4114.443,"There is 128 stalls and this agreement allows the school district, specifically students and staff to utilize those 128 stalls during the school year.",114,,
508,0.97,4114.443,4118.113,In the parks and Rec we utilize any remaining stalls there.,114,,
509,0.97,4118.113,4120.816,Next slide.,114,,
510,0.97,4120.816,4125.354,"And then, a little different here, the school district has all the parking.",114,,
511,0.97,4125.354,4138.033,"And the middle left is where the Southwest teen life center and pool, and to the right is the field for the school and at the top is the high school.",114,,
512,0.97,4138.033,4143.372,The yellow box represents the parking stalls that are subject of this agreement.,114,,
513,0.97,4143.372,4152.381,We have access to 85 stalls and use them at all hours aligned with our program.,114,,
514,0.97,4152.381,4154.95,With the exception of some negotiated days.,114,,
515,0.97,4154.95,4167.496,As you can imagine the Stadium has many events.,114,,
516,0.97,4167.496,4182.478,"And then the next slide to do due diligence, we went through and had an appraisal of the property of the stalls being shared.",114,,
517,0.97,4182.478,4199.695,"And for the parking spaces, the stalls there have a little more higher value than the stalls over at medicine.",114,,
518,0.97,4199.695,4203.132,So essentially it would be an even swap.,114,,
519,0.97,4203.132,4216.445,And we think this makes a lot of sense both operationally and it helps us to help the school district meet our parking needs.,114,,
520,0.97,4216.445,4219.682,I am happy to answer any questions.,114,,
521,0.97,4219.682,4232.261,Any questions to our Presenters here today?,115,,
522,0.97,4233.729,4236.332,"And I know that you did the summary and fiscal note, thank you.",115,,
523,0.97,4236.332,4238.567,I had a chance to look at the legislation as well.,115,,
524,0.97,4238.567,4239.368,Any questions from anyone?,115,,
525,0.97,4239.368,4241.47,Basically a renewal of an agreement to share parking.,115,,
526,0.97,4241.47,4243.072,Pretty straightforward.,115,,
527,0.97,4243.072,4244.373,"With that, I move it forward.",115,,
528,0.97,4244.373,4253.382,I move the committee pass counsel bill 120033.,115,,
529,0.97,4253.382,4254.95,"It has been Seconded, no further discussion.",115,,
530,0.97,4254.95,4258.954,Will the clerk please call the roll.,115,,
531,0.97,4258.954,4278.707,"[roll call]. five in favor, none opposed.",116,,
532,0.97,4278.707,4288.517,Let's read item number six into the record which is the Southwest youth and family services use and occupancy maintenance agreement.,117,,
533,0.97,4288.517,4292.021,Council bill 120050.,118,,
534,0.97,4292.021,4310.339,Relating to Seattle Braxton Parr creation to provide family support consistent with Seattle parks and recreation purposes.,118,,
535,0.97,4310.339,4311.94,They will be a brief discussion of possible vote.,118,,
536,0.97,4311.94,4318.213,This was the one where you have your Eight-Page Powerpoint.,119,,
537,0.97,4318.213,4332.661,"I want to thank you because I really like the public benefits piece it's a really good example to layout the benefit, description and value.",119,,
538,0.97,4332.661,4333.328,But well done.,119,,
539,0.97,4333.328,4339.468,Thank you very much.,119,,
540,0.97,4339.468,4341.07,I will again introduce myself for the record.,119,,
541,0.97,4341.07,4344.74,The superintendent of parks and recreation.,119,,
542,0.97,4344.74,4358.487,We also have the Ceo of the Southwest youth and family services who will also be participating in the presentation.,119,,
543,0.97,4358.487,4360.122,I'm the manager parks and concessions.,120,,
544,0.97,4360.122,4362.691,We also have Bob Warner here.,120,,
545,0.97,4362.691,4364.793,If he jumps on.,120,,
546,0.97,4364.793,4373.435,I'm Bob Warner and I'm also with parks and recreation.,121,,
547,0.97,4373.435,4383.479,I see that Joanne did the summary and fiscal note.,122,,
548,0.97,4383.479,4384.713,It was a team effort.,123,,
549,0.97,4384.713,4391.22,"Okay, thank you.",124,,
550,0.97,4391.22,4400.329,I am the executive director of the parks and Rec services.,125,,
551,0.97,4400.329,4409.638,"We will ask again for you to share the slides, thank you for your help.",126,,
552,0.97,4409.638,4419.648,"As we go through this, this is the renewal of a 20 year agreement that has been in place between the Department of parks and recreation in the Southwest youth center.",126,,
553,0.97,4419.648,4431.46,Really to continue the partnership that Aligns with their vision in supporting community.,126,,
554,0.97,4431.46,4434.563,So we will go into some of the wonderful services that Steve and the team do.,126,,
555,0.97,4434.563,4446.575,This has expired in 2015 and we have been renewing it year after year as we navigate our way through the pandemic.,126,,
556,0.97,4446.575,4447.976,But also the whole public aspect of this.,126,,
557,0.97,4447.976,4467.996,"This was a partnership that started back, obviously 25 years ago now, with the intent that it would be an opportunity for Southwest youth and family Úservices to be in this Buildin and no cost in exchange for their service to the community.",126,,
558,0.97,4467.996,4481.276,So we really worked with Steve and his team to quantify it in a way that makes sense for us in terms of the new framework and benefits including the reporting.,126,,
559,0.97,4481.276,4486.982,So that is what this agreement is all about.,126,,
560,0.97,4486.982,4491.086,The next slide just shows you where the facility is.,126,,
561,0.97,4491.086,4505.634,"It is important to note, this is the old, former Dell ridge community center location that we are talking about.",126,,
562,0.97,4505.634,4513.442,"The new community center, just north of the picture on the top right.",126,,
563,0.97,4513.442,4532.961,And this is a location that is well aligned with the mission and work of the Southwest youth and family services in terms of really looking into working with the community members at the highest level.,126,,
564,0.97,4532.961,4539.568,"This is a Long-Standing partnership, we are really pleased to continue this.",126,,
565,0.97,4539.568,4546.975,I had the opportunity to visit the sites to see the great work they are doing.,126,,
566,0.97,4546.975,4570.198,"Úbut back in 92, the city, as W enter this partnership, really allowed the Southwest youth and family services center to develop and build a new facility there, in exchange for their investment that they raise $2 million to do that, they will have access to the building, free of rent.",126,,
567,0.97,4570.198,4587.316,"So as I have stated they have been a valuable partner providing youth development, family health services, to our community members that are most Underserved here in Seattle.",126,,
568,0.97,4587.316,4590.419,"Next slide, and then I think I will turn it over after this.",126,,
569,0.97,4590.419,4599.027,"Again, this is, we are renewing a release that was in place for 20 years.",126,,
570,0.97,4599.027,4607.035,We are proposing a 10 year extension with an option to have another 10 year extension under mutual agreement.,126,,
571,0.97,4607.035,4619.247,"We've done the analysis in terms of what the market rate grant will be which is just under $200,000 a year.",126,,
572,0.97,4619.247,4634.997,"And as I said in the beginning, our intent from the beginning was to continue this long- standing partnership to work with the Southwest youth and family services center to be in the building without having to pay rent and change for the great programs and services that are offered to the community.",126,,
573,0.97,4634.997,4648.844,"Another thing to note here is that Southwest youth and family services takes care of all of the building itself, they do all the major and minor maintenance.",126,,
574,0.97,4648.844,4658.954,"So we do not have to worry about that building, and we can talk about some of the specific things.",126,,
575,0.97,4658.954,4667.195,"At this point, I'd like to turn it over to Steve for the next slide.",126,,
576,0.97,4667.195,4669.197,Thank you very much.,127,,
577,0.97,4669.197,4678.874,I don't often get a chance to talk about the Southwest youth and family services.,127,,
578,0.97,4678.874,4681.576,Just a brief history.,127,,
579,0.97,4681.576,4692.421,The policy board was created in 1979 as a function of the city of Seattle.,127,,
580,0.97,4692.421,4698.026,So we were actually part of the city when we were founded.,127,,
581,0.97,4698.026,4710.639,To respond primarily to the accountability cords that were put together at that time.,127,,
582,0.97,4710.639,4715.444,For the young people getting involved in the criminal justice system.,127,,
583,0.97,4715.444,4719.114,And they didn't have anywhere to refer them to.,127,,
584,0.97,4719.114,4745.774,"So they created the four of us, and at the time, and over those last years we've developed programming behavioral health, have a licensed health agency and provide a variety of supports for young people and their families.",127,,
585,0.97,4745.774,4759.254,"Including Antiviolence work and case management, youth development we have an education program for kids who have been kicked out or dropped out of school.",127,,
586,0.97,4759.254,4767.696,"And we do the summer writers workshop that allows for young people to express themselves in a way that they see fit, it is just a phenomenal program.",127,,
587,0.97,4767.696,4778.24,We have a family advocacy resource center that was initially started by the city of Seattle.,127,,
588,0.97,4778.24,4785.013,We support families to access resources and supports.,127,,
589,0.97,4785.013,4793.688,It is also the home of our parent child plus program.,127,,
590,0.97,4793.688,4802.731,"And then we have youth development, where we do some youth development work in Seattle.",127,,
591,0.97,4802.731,4821.85,Most of that came as a result of a merger of our 13 facilities in several counties.,127,,
592,0.97,4821.85,4827.422,"Just to give you a brief overview of the organizations budget, we have a $6 million budget.",127,,
593,0.97,4827.422,4834.429,We are roughly divided 60% public and 40% private.,127,,
594,0.97,4834.429,4841.87,"For the total budget, about 20% is for the city of Seattle.",127,,
595,0.97,4841.87,4851.246,So the majority of our budget is from sources outside of city funding.,127,,
596,0.97,4851.246,4861.856,"And as Jesus said, all of the funds will be used from sources other than the city of Seattle.",127,,
597,0.97,4861.856,4867.495,We are grateful for being able to use this facility.,127,,
598,0.97,4867.495,4874.302,I have been the executive director for almost 33 years.,127,,
599,0.97,4874.302,4879.274,I got to negotiate the original lease.,127,,
600,0.97,4879.274,4884.512,And I'm here 20 years later facilitating the second lease extension.,127,,
601,0.97,4884.512,4893.188,Other than that I will turn it back to Jesus.,127,,
602,0.97,4893.188,4897.325,Thank you Steve.,128,,
603,0.97,4897.325,4908.637,And I appreciate the fish behind your head.,128,,
604,0.97,4910.372,4922.317,"So to go into more detail, Steve, certainly feel free to Chime in, but this just gives an outline of the various programs.",129,,
605,0.97,4922.317,4943.638,"I think the key point here is that, part of the reason we want to make sure we outline this very specifically as to ensure that whatever we are giving Southwest credit for in terms of public benefit, are not other programs and services being funded.",129,,
606,0.97,4943.638,4944.873,So that is what you see here.,129,,
607,0.97,4944.873,4952.247,Obviously this doesn't capture the entire scope of work that the Southwest youth & amp; family services does but it gives you an idea.,129,,
608,0.97,4952.247,4957.152,It lets the public see how it's offset.,130,,
609,0.97,4957.152,4958.186,And that is what is important.,130,,
610,0.97,4958.186,4963.892,"And when we focus on public benefit, when we talk about city-owned material or assets, you have to explain this is how it balances out.",130,,
611,0.97,4963.892,4969.397,They provide this public in a fit and there is a number attached to it.,130,,
612,0.97,4969.397,4975.603,"This is why they don't pay rent, or whatever.",130,,
613,0.97,4975.603,4986.481,That's why I was Lamenting the staff Powerpoint on this in particular.,130,,
614,0.97,4986.481,4990.819,The use public assets for programs because they are contributing of public benefit.,130,,
615,0.97,4990.819,4996.091,"They are keeping the public in the institution itself, so thank you.",130,,
616,0.97,4996.091,5014.142,"To that end, in addition to the $1.2 million that already has been invested in the building itself, the Southwest youth & amp; family services invests roughly $384,000 a year of Non-City dollars serving the residents and folks in the area.",131,,
617,0.97,5014.142,5018.346,So this gives you a breakdown.,131,,
618,0.97,5018.346,5023.618,The next slide gives you information about pogroms and scholarships and outreach.,131,,
619,0.97,5023.618,5027.355,"And again, Steve feel free to Chime in.",131,,
620,0.97,5027.355,5029.824,This is your work and it's really wonderful.,131,,
621,0.97,5029.824,5045.14,"So you I'm happy to answer any questions, we really would appreciate your support in extending this agreement further and giving us the option for second 10 year extension.",131,,
622,0.97,5045.14,5051.379,Is there anything you want to add Mr. Daschle?,132,,
623,0.97,5051.379,5056.651,"No, I think the slides have done a wonderful job representing our work.",133,,
624,0.97,5056.651,5071.666,"I think, given that much of our work is focused on the immigrant communities, I think we are facilitating public policy in the work we do.",133,,
625,0.97,5071.666,5079.307,I often say the nonprofit sector is under the limitation of public policy.,133,,
626,0.97,5079.307,5086.614,And I think we are an example Úof the work we do together to better serve.,133,,
627,0.97,5086.614,5090.785,And I'm happy to answer any questions.,133,,
628,0.97,5090.785,5095.623,"Colleagues, any questions we want to ask of our Presenters?",134,,
629,0.97,5095.623,5096.224,Councilmember Herbold.,134,,
630,0.97,5096.224,5100.295,"Not a question, just a statement, appreciation and thanks.",135,,
631,0.97,5100.295,5142.036,"I want to thank the parks Department for working with Southwest youth and family services, historically in creating this partnership that I think is, as Steve says, so important for driving, not just our investments but for driving public policy and appreciate the reminder from Steve Howe cutting edge your organization was around the conversation we are continuing to have today which is about alternatives.",135,,
632,0.97,5142.036,5153.148,I just really appreciate all the work you do.,135,,
633,0.97,5153.148,5175.703,"It looks when you last negotiated this in 1986, 25 years of contributing and being an example, and the issue we have for the city to have is not profit groups out there, such as thank you I know you do some really good work.",136,,
634,0.97,5175.703,5189.784,And I know Councilmember Herbold is very proud that it's in her district.,136,,
635,0.97,5189.784,5193.021,"It's my district, too, and it's just around the corner.",137,,
636,0.97,5193.021,5195.523,Thanks so much for that time from a few years ago.,137,,
637,0.97,5195.523,5211.906,"Okay, with that folks, if we have no further questions, I am going to move the committee to pass Council bill 120050.",138,,
