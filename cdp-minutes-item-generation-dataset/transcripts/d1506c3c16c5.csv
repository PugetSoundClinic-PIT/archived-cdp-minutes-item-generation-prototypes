198,0.97,1322.754,1332.431,These should include policy recommendations for Lastly weapons and purpose of crowd disperse and will also identification of those crowd dispersal authorization process.,26,,
199,0.97,1332.431,1337.836,That does require executive approval and reflects best practices.,26,,
200,0.97,1337.836,1340.806,That's to minimize harm to protestors from police.,26,,
201,0.97,1340.806,1346.912,Couple items we want to as a community reflect on.,27,,
202,0.97,1346.912,1356.355,There have been experiences that have been obviously presented with the median but also experiences we have heard from community.,27,,
203,0.97,1356.355,1361.393,Some of those include dozens of injuries.,27,,
204,0.97,1361.393,1361.993,Less lethal weapons reported.,27,,

211,0.97,1385.584,1395.861,The CPC had raised this issue regarding SPD use of crowd control weapons repeatedly.,28,,
212,0.97,1395.861,1403.135,This reflected back to 2015- 2016 asking SPD to disregard or eliminate the use of blast balls and tear gas.,28,,
213,0.97,1403.135,1406.671,Now we're going to go through the recommendations that are important.,28,,
214,0.97,1406.671,1408.406,There were nine in total.,28,,
215,0.97,1408.406,1409.04,I'll do this quickly.,28,,
216,0.97,1409.04,1415.547,We can leave time for questions at the end.,28,,
217,0.97,1415.547,1426.258,Our first recommendation was CPC supports the ban on use of crowd control weapons as it pertains to activity.,29,,
218,0.97,1426.258,1429.694,Spd implements it as soon as possible.,29,,

229,0.97,1504.102,1513.511,Authorizing officers should thoroughly document an agency outside and should review any and all actions taken.,29,,
230,0.97,1513.511,1526.691,Additionally we strongly urge this documentation and the authorizing rain is made publicly available within 24 hours of the incident effective immediately.,29,,
231,0.97,1526.691,1530.562,Recommendation 6. we recommend the city prohibit the sale of crowd control.,29,,

233,0.97,1544.676,1564.596,"Recommendation 7. the CPC recommends SPD investigate and make public the full inventory of the Department's crowd control weapons to determine next steps of disposal similar to recommendation 6. if we are to get rid of these and no longer sore and House them or sell them, the city needs to know what does SPD have in their arsenal?",29,,
234,0.97,1564.596,1576.841,"When information is on the table, that way people are able I believe to make the best decision on how to dispose of weapons.",29,,

239,0.97,1612.51,1626.157,Ie riot gear to these demonstrations versus the other 300 demonstrations on average that happened in Seattle on a basis.,30,,

243,0.97,1645.243,1651.816,"So Yeah, I think it's appropriate for us to move into questions.",31,,
244,0.97,1651.816,1661.159,I know that my office did collect some questions from Council members in advance of this meeting and sent those on.,31,,
245,0.97,1661.159,1692.457,We will--what I'll do in interest of hearing from Council members who may not have submitted questions but are with us today perhaps will just start there and if I don't hear any questions I'll move over to the questions I know were submitted on behalf of Council members.,31,,
246,0.97,1692.457,1696.861,We'll offer those.,31,,
247,0.97,1696.861,1703.435,Does any Council member have a question for Shalene or director grant?,31,,
248,0.97,1703.435,1707.138,I have a question if I can.,31,,
249,0.97,1707.138,1709.14,Thank you.,32,,
250,0.97,1709.14,1720.652,Thank you to the others from CPC 4 pulling together this report and having the recommendations the available to us.,33,,
251,0.97,1720.652,1722.287,Just a couple of questions.,33,,
252,0.97,1722.287,1727.692,One is there's a couple references are to a community centered process.,33,,
253,0.97,1727.692,1743.975,I was hoping you'd be able to speak a little more about what that means from CPC's perspective.,33,,
254,0.97,1743.975,1764.062,There's references to recommendation three where the city generally and I think there's another place where it just references the city generally.,33,,
255,0.97,1764.062,1796.728,So I'd like to get a little more clarity around who CPC defines as being the city in the context of recommendation three and four in order for us to get a better understanding of who the CPC believes should be leading that work or triggering that work into actually happening.,33,,
256,0.97,1796.728,1801.032,"In other words, does SPD have to leave this work?",33,,
257,0.97,1801.032,1811.776,Is this responsibility of the Mayor to initiate the work? responsibility is it when recommendations refer to the city generally as opposed to specific agency?,33,,
258,0.97,1811.776,1834.699,Then the last question is there's one of the recommendations suggest that there should be an independent agency for evaluate.,33,,
259,0.97,1835.7,1839.304,Is there thoughts on who the independent agency should be?,33,,
260,0.97,1839.304,1839.971,I appreciate those questions.,33,,
261,0.97,1839.971,1847.545,If I may and I also want to give director grant if she wants to Chime in.,33,,
262,0.97,1847.545,1851.616,Your first and second question really go hand in hand quite well.,33,,
263,0.97,1851.616,1852.951,I'll say it this way.,33,,
264,0.97,1852.951,1864.696,"When we talk about triggering a response or leading the work, a lot of times what ends up happening is it comes from an agency level first.",33,,
265,0.97,1864.696,1873.938,"That CPC, I'm sure our director with the same thing, the triggering events already happened.",33,,
266,0.97,1873.938,1874.639,We're already in it.,33,,
267,0.97,1874.639,1878.81,Community center along with the community is already driving the work.,33,,
268,0.97,1878.81,1880.545,The community is screaming and shouting at us.,33,,
269,0.97,1880.545,1883.381,We want to be part of the table.,33,,
270,0.97,1883.381,1894.092,Not just a silent partner at the table where we see them throwing a chair.,33,,
271,0.97,1894.092,1898.162,We implement the actions they're telling us to take.,33,,
272,0.97,1898.162,1899.631,The tricky who drives and who leads.,33,,
273,0.97,1899.631,1906.871,We would love that on the agency level to be a collective action which is why we talk about the city.,33,,
274,0.97,1906.871,1910.575,"The city should include SPD, Council, the Mayor's office.",33,,
275,0.97,1910.575,1927.258,"It's not just one body, one agency that needs to drive this work.",33,,
276,0.97,1927.258,1933.364,"It is the city, including the CPC and accountability partners that work in conjunction with each other.",34,,
277,0.97,1933.364,1937.568,"When we say community centered, that means the community is at the center of the decision making.",34,,
278,0.97,1937.568,1946.744,"They are at the center of driving the discussion, driving the conversation, letting us know Hey, these are the issues we want you to tackle.",34,,
279,0.97,1946.744,1951.215,"We heard in the public statement, public comment earlier.",34,,
280,0.97,1951.215,1956.654,"What people focus on, what they fear from SPD, what they want from us.",34,,
281,0.97,1956.654,1957.021,We listen.,34,,
282,0.97,1957.021,1961.893,"At the CPC, we have done a good job of listening.",34,,
283,0.97,1961.893,1971.469,"Now we put that language in there as centered as they should be with every process, every step we take to police reform and overhaul every time.",34,,
284,0.97,1971.469,1978.543,"We say the city, we're talking about every city agency that has a hand in this way as we should along side with the community.",34,,
285,0.97,1978.543,1982.08,Your first two questions really O hand in hand.,34,,
286,0.97,1982.08,1988.252,"As far as the third question, independent agency.",34,,
287,0.97,1988.252,2003.034,"Again, I'll have to refer to the first and second question.",34,,
288,0.97,2003.034,2004.235,"I'll have understanding, expertise.",34,,
289,0.97,2004.235,2012.977,We're here to advise the committee to listen here's what we think.,34,,
290,0.97,2012.977,2016.614,"Have all of it, have a transparent process.",34,,
291,0.97,2016.614,2017.015,Let them tell us.,34,,
292,0.97,2017.015,2022.186,Here's what we want as far as agency and process.,34,,
293,0.97,2022.186,2024.722,Including that independent agency that you're speaking of.,34,,
294,0.97,2024.722,2032.964,I think collaboration could look different in these days.,34,,
295,0.97,2032.964,2046.277,"Community centered in all these questions, let them decide.",34,,
296,0.97,2046.277,2048.146,Thank you.,35,,
297,0.97,2048.146,2053.351,I appreciate that.,35,,
298,0.97,2053.351,2055.753,Are there raised hands?,35,,
299,0.97,2055.753,2056.054,All right.,35,,
300,0.97,2056.054,2060.224,Council member Sawant?,35,,
301,0.97,2060.224,2063.828,I appreciate presentation prepared for today and the ongoing work.,35,,
302,0.97,2063.828,2080.678,"I just--first of all, I could not agree more that we have to--as an elected body, the city Council has obligation, the Mayor's office.",35,,
303,0.97,2080.678,2085.583,Mayor Durkan has obligation to listen to voices in the community.,35,,
304,0.97,2085.583,2095.76,It doesn't mean just offering them space where they can talk about how the police violence is affecting them.,35,,
305,0.97,2095.76,2096.427,Actually acting on them.,35,,
306,0.97,2096.427,2106.137,"You know, on behalf of the thousands of people that have shown such courage, I'm so proud of the bill that we were able to pass.",35,,
307,0.97,2106.137,2117.982,The ban on crowd control weapons are so called crowd control weapons itself was a result of my office listening to the people in the community.,35,,
308,0.97,2117.982,2124.989,It was I believe passed unanimously or almost unanimously by the city council.,35,,
309,0.97,2124.989,2125.723,I can't recall exactly.,35,,
310,0.97,2125.723,2134.132,I know the majority of the city council stood strongly in favor of that.,35,,
311,0.97,2134.132,2147.445,"In my view, that is a positive approach that can be taken by elected representatives.",35,,
312,0.97,2147.445,2167.231,"In your report, you say you'd like the community police Commission is requesting the office police accountability, office Inspector general and CPC themselves made recommendations that suggest policy revisions SPD Manuel for use of less lethal weapons for purpose of crowd dispersal.",35,,
313,0.97,2167.231,2171.936,I'm asking to clarify because you haven't said that exclusively.,35,,
314,0.97,2171.936,2177.508,Do you mean in which what is what I would favor of course.,35,,
315,0.97,2177.508,2183.214,Do you mean revisions in the policy Manuel should be made in accordance with the Ordnance passed?,35,,
316,0.97,2183.214,2185.917,Do you mean just in general?,35,,
317,0.97,2185.917,2195.092,"That was the whole purpose of that ordinance is to seriously address, not just talk about it and make minimal changes.",35,,
318,0.97,2195.092,2200.197,Seriously address the violence that was being directed at protestors.,35,,
319,0.97,2200.197,2202.433,I appreciate it in closing out.,35,,
320,0.97,2202.433,2206.07,I'll also say I really like your presentation.,35,,
321,0.97,2206.07,2209.373,You first started noting the harm done by police violence to the community.,35,,
322,0.97,2209.373,2215.913,That is why I never say crowd control.,35,,
323,0.97,2215.913,2218.983,I say the whole premise is mistaken or dishonest.,35,,
324,0.97,2218.983,2227.592,Police say we had to deploy because we were facing situations that needed to be controlled.,35,,
325,0.97,2227.592,2230.828,That is far from the truth.,35,,
326,0.97,2230.828,2236.367,Overwhelming majority of situations is when they are instigating the Violenc against a peaceful protest movement.,35,,
327,0.97,2236.367,2238.469,That's not just me saying it.,35,,
328,0.97,2238.469,2248.145,Thousands will attest to that based on their own personal experience.,35,,
329,0.97,2248.145,2249.647,If you could clarify that.,35,,
330,0.97,2249.647,2249.947,Thank you.,35,,
331,0.97,2249.947,2258.856,"In revision of use of force policies, the revision of policies it should always fall in line with Ordnances and legislation that has been passed.",36,,
332,0.97,2258.856,2272.47,"As we have seen and as you have noted and as we Únoted in our presentation, things have been very different, violent in the last few noes in seat and nationwide.",36,,
333,0.97,2272.47,2277.742,"Local to Seattle, very much so and felt by nerve Seattle and surrounding Seattle area.",36,,
334,0.97,2277.742,2284.882,"So we're also proposing is also a deep dive, an overhaul with partners and community center again at the table.",36,,
335,0.97,2284.882,2293.391,Really looking at policies and not just from an Ivory tower academic stance of here we pulled facts and figures and what we think.,36,,
336,0.97,2293.391,2300.564,We have statements from people on how the operation of those policies have failed Tem.,36,,
337,0.97,2300.564,2304.035,So what your say as good exactly what we're saying.,36,,
338,0.97,2304.035,2327.425,Let's take that dive and look through the newer eyes of what's Transpireded in the past few months so yes to both.,36,,
339,0.97,2327.425,2329.527,Thank you.,37,,
340,0.97,2329.527,2331.429,Councilmember Morales.,37,,

342,0.97,2335.933,2336.734,I'm on mute.,37,,
343,0.97,2336.734,2339.07,I'm going to wait.,37,,
344,0.97,2339.07,2342.206,I want to hear all the presentations.,37,,
345,0.97,2342.206,2361.292,I want to lift up some of the questions that were submitted in advance from Council members.,37,,
346,0.97,2361.292,2375.473,One question shows the OPA reports sites the noise or others known as flash bangs more powerful than flash balls.,37,,
347,0.97,2375.473,2381.445,They don't believe they should be used.,37,,
348,0.97,2381.445,2403.534,"Just wondering, the position on flash bangs versus blast balls and just wanting more understanding about that given the perception that the flash bangs are more powerful.",37,,
349,0.97,2403.534,2409.14,Whether we should change the title of the Ordnance itself.,37,,
350,0.97,2409.14,2427.792,"The title is crowd control weapons and as we have heard from all three accountability bodies as well as other Stakeholders, these weapons are used in multiple contexts not only crowd control.",37,,
351,0.97,2427.792,2444.375,"If we're going to regulate these weapons, I believe we might need to consider whether or not they have a title that broadly explains that we are regulating those Wapons broadly not just in one particular use.",37,,
352,0.97,2444.375,2469.467,The third question that was submitted in advance relates specifically to the policy of declaring unlawful assemblies when the commander cease that there are acts or conduct in the group of four more persons of substantial risk causing injury to any person or harm to property.,37,,
353,0.97,2469.467,2475.639,What elements does the CPC think should be considered when determining unlawful assembly?,37,,
354,0.97,2475.639,2478.108,Thank you.,37,,
355,0.97,2478.108,2480.411,Thank you for those questions Councilmember Herbold.,38,,
356,0.97,2480.411,2484.915,Let me work in a slightly different order.,38,,
357,0.97,2484.915,2489.019,"I'd like to go question two, one, three in that particular order.",38,,
358,0.97,2489.019,2501.899,So the question about do we believe that the title should be changed to one that regulates weapons of less lethal force.,38,,
359,0.97,2501.899,2503.367,Just to start off.,38,,
360,0.97,2503.367,2511.108,The naming of this ordinance is up to your discretion as Council.,38,,
361,0.97,2511.108,2525.789,Our stance is that some appropriate and heavily regulated less lethal options should be available to officers outside protests and demonstrations such as patrol operations and extreme situations and hostage situations as well.,38,,
362,0.97,2525.789,2539.336,"Further more, those weapons should be available to lessen the over all amount of force that officers must use when facing those kind of incidents.",38,,
363,0.97,2539.336,2541.739,So that's the first part.,38,,
364,0.97,2541.739,2556.987,The question about the flash bangs versus blast balls and what tools would we recommend as a Commission for SPD to use for less lethal options in control operations.,38,,
365,0.97,2556.987,2558.188,"Under policy, it's 8.200.",38,,
366,0.97,2558.188,2560.958,That describes the use of force tools.,38,,
367,0.97,2560.958,2567.031,It's clear the main purpose for SPD having blast balls in their arsenal is use them in crowd control situations.,38,,
368,0.97,2567.031,2574.972,We have seen the dangerous results of blast balls including near death of a Protestor struck by one in the chest.,38,,
369,0.97,2574.972,2575.806,That's why we called for their ban.,38,,
370,0.97,2575.806,2582.479,Flash bangs on the other hand are not mentioned in any crowd control or Department wide policy.,38,,
371,0.97,2582.479,2588.419,They're part of Swat and generally not used during protests.,38,,
372,0.97,2588.419,2592.389,Cpd have not reviewed their use if that's something you're requesting.,38,,
373,0.97,2592.389,2595.292,We're happy to do that.,38,,
374,0.97,2595.292,2597.594,We have not reviewed.,38,,
375,0.97,2597.594,2604.935,"Cpc fully supports the Council's ban on less lethal weapons, used for purpose of crowd control or protest investigation.",38,,
376,0.97,2604.935,2623.22,"However, like I said earlier, we also acknowledge outside a protest, for example, during patrol operations, less lethal options such as Tasers, pepper spray, some very extraordinary extreme measures 40-Millimeter lawn chairs may be necessary.",38,,
377,0.97,2623.22,2642.539,"The key part here is that as long as SPD has strong policies and accountability measures in place, Seattle has seen situations in the past where an officer does not bring their mandated less lethal device and it had deadly results.",38,,
378,0.97,2642.539,2649.98,It's important to also have strong policies and strong mechanisms that are going to be used.,38,,
379,0.97,2649.98,2659.59,"That the being said, SPD should eliminate tear gas and blast balls in line with recommendations going back several years.",38,,
380,0.97,2659.59,2661.859,They're indiscriminate weapons.,38,,
381,0.97,2661.859,2665.329,Tear gas is banned in war.,38,,
382,0.97,2665.329,2667.398,Blast balls can be deadly.,38,,
383,0.97,2667.398,2669.099,Specificationly used during Proest Thes.,38,,
384,0.97,2669.099,2676.173,For the last question if I I'm able.,38,,
385,0.97,2676.173,2684.715,Talking about what element Doss s do CPC she should be considered?,38,,
386,0.97,2684.715,2693.924,"To CPC, it's clear from a cursory read that the four or more person standard is far too well.",38,,
387,0.97,2693.924,2701.899,Effectively enables police to declare constitutionally protected rights no longer exist if one person in a crowd of thousands does something wrong.,38,,
388,0.97,2701.899,2704.034,That standard is way too low.,38,,
389,0.97,2704.034,2721.185,"In our report, the CPC recommends the Council, CPC, Oig and others come together to set clear, strong, high standards for when police and officials are able to declare unlawful assemblies, riots, Institute curfews.",38,,
390,0.97,2721.185,2725.055,We want that to be a collaborative process to set those standards.,38,,
391,0.97,2725.055,2731.695,What is clear is that there needs to be a pressing reason likely involving the preservation of life.,38,,
392,0.97,2731.695,2736.667,It needs to be possible to comply with that order.,38,,
393,0.97,2736.667,2747.544,"As we saw in the early days of the protest, the Mayor's office instituted a Curfew that gave people minutes to comply.",38,,
394,0.97,2747.544,2751.014,"Effectively, turning many peaceful protestors on the streets into criminals.",38,,
395,0.97,2751.014,2763.727,Then that Curfew was left in place for days long Afterany claims of violence could be made voiding first amendment rights in the mass movement.,38,,
396,0.97,2763.727,2795.425,"The previously instituted Curfew not only infringed on about for protest s to assemble, it exacerbated protestors . We Node do a better job in policies and practices.",38,,
397,0.97,2795.425,2795.759,Thank you.,38,,
398,0.97,2795.759,2796.226,Thank you.,39,,
399,0.97,2796.226,2796.627,Other questions?,39,,
400,0.97,2796.627,2798.428,"Council member Mosqueda, please.",39,,
401,0.97,2798.428,2799.029,Thank you.,39,,
402,0.97,2799.029,2799.83,Thank you very much.,40,,
403,0.97,2799.83,2807.704,I appreciate the invitation too participate knowing I'm not a member of this committee but appreciate the option to weigh in after others have commented.,40,,
404,0.97,2807.704,2814.711,Really appreciate being here for a minute to hear the presentation today.,40,,
405,0.97,2814.711,2815.345,I have two question.,40,,
406,0.97,2815.345,2824.588,The first is clarification on the last response you gave to Council member Herbold as chair of the committee.,40,,
407,0.97,2824.588,2826.423,You said the strong recommendations remains.,40,,
408,0.97,2826.423,2835.132,"Even though there's all of these recommendations here, you're unequivocally saying we should eliminate tear gas and blast balls.",40,,
409,0.97,2835.132,2835.532,Is that correct?,40,,
410,0.97,2835.532,2836.066,That is correct.,40,,
411,0.97,2836.066,2843.74,That's something we recommended in the past and stand by.,41,,
412,0.97,2843.74,2843.941,Yes.,41,,
413,0.97,2843.941,2844.208,Okay.,42,,
414,0.97,2844.208,2846.376,I think that's important.,42,,
415,0.97,2846.376,2870.267,"As we engaged in this process of continuing to pull individuals together, pulling together hundreds of organizations and bringing in more individuals into the conversation, I think it's important for us to hear and lift up that recommendation that immediately we should be eliminating the use of tear gas and blast balls.",42,,
416,0.97,2870.267,2873.604,It's causing physical harm to people.,42,,
417,0.97,2873.604,2885.682,We know these items have been banned in war and we're in the midst of a pandemic.,42,,
418,0.97,2885.682,2886.884,Tear gas is deployed.,42,,
419,0.97,2886.884,2898.862,I think that's a really important recommendation you made in the past that you're making again.,42,,
420,0.97,2898.862,2902.633,Recommendation in terms of four in terms of a quote riot is declared.,42,,
421,0.97,2902.633,2913.977,I'm concerned as the Seattle times is reported four days ago that the term riot continues to be used.,42,,
422,0.97,2913.977,2920.384,Riots are used as justification to deploy tear gas and blast balls continuously.,42,,
423,0.97,2920.384,2940.737,Do you have recommendation for when not only all of these are recommendations you listed on the slide should be deployed but recommendation specific to ending the use of declared riots until we can get that agreed upon term.,42,,
424,0.97,2940.737,2949.379,What isn't agreed upon is mischief including fires and broken windows.,42,,
425,0.97,2949.379,2952.182,You mentioned extreme us situations like hostages.,42,,
426,0.97,2952.182,2954.985,I understand some weapons may be necessary.,42,,
427,0.97,2954.985,2970.901,"Talking about crowd control and the term riot being used on a free basis, do you have recommendations the, for what 20 do in the interim and how fast we should stop the use of tear gas and blast balls?",42,,
428,0.97,2970.901,2974.905,I'm going to answer a little bit and confer with Cochairs.,42,,
429,0.97,2974.905,2975.372,Some we discussed.,42,,
430,0.97,2975.372,2982.679,Also I want to make sure I get this right and we're happy to respond publicly.,42,,
431,0.97,2982.679,2996.259,"So when we're talking about use of less lethal weapons and saying some can be used, that is Districtly outside of demonstrations, protective behavior in patrol operations.",42,,
432,0.97,2996.259,3000.764,We say officers might need some at their disposal so they're not left with a Firearm.,42,,
433,0.97,3000.764,3002.866,The I want to make that clear.,42,,
434,0.97,3002.866,3010.874,"As far as timing, we're talking about the use of tear gas and blast balls.",42,,
435,0.97,3010.874,3014.845,When we made the recommendation in 2016-2017 that was effective immediately.,42,,
436,0.97,3014.845,3017.547,"We said right now, effective immediately.",42,,
437,0.97,3017.547,3018.715,Those are harmful and dangerous.,42,,
438,0.97,3018.715,3032.496,"With tear gas, we're in the middle of a pandemic that's largely respiratory.",42,,
439,0.97,3032.496,3034.431,That use is completely inappropriate.,42,,
440,0.97,3034.431,3048.111,"Loving forward on the interim that timing is one of those things that if we were to have to give a time frame, that is something I'd love to come from our Cochairs or director.",42,,
441,0.97,3048.111,3066.096,"What I will say and what we have said repeatedly over and over again is that weapons during a constitutionally protected behavior or assembly demonstration protest, whatever language you'd like to use, all of this is the same.",42,,
442,0.97,3066.096,3068.832,These are our rights that people have.,42,,
443,0.97,3068.832,3079.81,"Unless there's the threat of imminent harm to persons, then they should not be used.",42,,
444,0.97,3079.81,3081.645,This is far too low.,42,,
445,0.97,3081.645,3082.913,We've seen our protest.,42,,
446,0.97,3082.913,3084.781,There's hundreds of thousands of people.,42,,
447,0.97,3084.781,3085.749,How are you able to Disearn.,42,,
448,0.97,3085.749,3088.752,We have counted and police officers that show up.,42,,
449,0.97,3088.752,3092.956,We met the bar of four people.,42,,
450,0.97,3092.956,3094.691,They're causing what we consider Mayham.,42,,
451,0.97,3094.691,3100.23,"Now we are using tear gas, blast balls, launchers.",42,,
452,0.97,3100.23,3104.734,The officers are skidding bikes into protestors as we saw Monday.,42,,
453,0.97,3104.734,3110.974,These violent acts of behavior erode community trust.,42,,
454,0.97,3110.974,3111.808,Is there community trust.,42,,
455,0.97,3111.808,3114.911,"As far as timing, it should be today.",42,,
456,0.97,3114.911,3119.916,Cpc is here and ready wanting to lift up the community.,42,,
457,0.97,3119.916,3123.253,Here's the community.,42,,
458,0.97,3123.253,3127.39,We would love to help with conversations.,42,,
459,0.97,3127.39,3130.727,Let them speak and respond to them.,42,,
460,0.97,3130.727,3131.528,The time is right now.,42,,
461,0.97,3131.528,3145.842,"I think giving the time frame of two or four days, six weeks, I think to the community that might seem arbitrary.",42,,
462,0.97,3145.842,3155.952,I can refer to the whole.,42,,
463,0.97,3155.952,3160.79,I'm happy to get back to you.,42,,
464,0.97,3160.79,3161.525,Thank you.,42,,
465,0.97,3161.525,3171.868,"I wanted to make it crystal clear that in your opinion, tear gas and blast balls should be banned period.",43,,
466,0.97,3171.868,3182.012,Appreciate the evidence cited and why they should be so deadly.,43,,
467,0.97,3182.012,3188.151,You touched a very important point that we recognize and acknowledge that in fact want the police.,43,,
468,0.97,3188.151,3210.173,"That has been a problem they haven't used haven't done this with what I'm about to say which is when they are carrying out parole operations, we want them to Prioritize life and make sure they're Warranting the use of some sort of force.",43,,
469,0.97,3210.173,3244.874,"So in that sense, we want the city's policies and my office absolutely want the policies to be determined in such a way it actually makes reasonable and when Mayor Durkan and other politicians around the nation make this--they make it seem like you can't achieve both.",43,,
470,0.97,3244.874,3257.487,They make sure the police Department has at disposal and insists on using and has policy Manuel that dictate this is policy of using less lethal weapons when this force is called for.,43,,
471,0.97,3257.487,3260.423,There's a whole thing to be discussed there as well.,43,,
472,0.97,3260.423,3262.993,I won't get into that.,43,,
473,0.97,3262.993,3275.972,"At the same time, that our democracies and cities should allow the constitutionally protested right to protest, gather on the streets, all of that to be enabled as well.",43,,
474,0.97,3275.972,3295.058,"I want to note in that context that is why hundreds of community members pushed back against an amendment that would have rather than gratifying issues, actually make--we don't want the policy to be Crafted in such a way that is very open to question.",43,,
475,0.97,3295.058,3299.329,The police can say I felt or needed to do this.,43,,
476,0.97,3299.329,3302.699,I wasn't against the Constitution of protective rights.,43,,
477,0.97,3302.699,3312.709,"We are to be crystal clear about those things and policy should be determined in such a way that for the most part, it is ironclad.",43,,
478,0.97,3312.709,3323.72,"The rights of people are protected and at the same time, we're not taking away about to actually make sure that life is not lost but situations are brought under control.",43,,
479,0.97,3323.72,3332.329,"The cases in which the police say that, there's nothing to be brought under control.",43,,
480,0.97,3332.329,3343.673,My experience has almost always been the May ham was started by the police not that they were responding to some Hayham or riots.,43,,
481,0.97,3343.673,3344.974,I appreciate you saying that.,43,,
482,0.97,3344.974,3351.614,Noting that is important for future policy making and how this should be implemented going forward.,43,,
483,0.97,3351.614,3353.483,Thank you so much.,44,,
484,0.97,3353.483,3356.252,Thank you Council member Sawant.,45,,
485,0.97,3356.252,3358.855,Let's turn over to director Mireburg if we could.,45,,
486,0.97,3358.855,3380.31,I'm going to try to share my screen.,46,,
487,0.97,3380.31,3380.71,.,46,,
488,0.97,3380.71,3382.679,Is that working for everyone?,47,,
489,0.97,3382.679,3382.879,Yes.,47,,
490,0.97,3382.879,3383.78,Thank you for having us here today.,47,,
491,0.97,3383.78,3399.195,I appreciate obviously getting the time to present on this report to Council and being allowed to be part of the process and Redeveloping this policy.,47,,
492,0.97,3399.195,3412.142,"As you've seen from the CP CPC presentation, there's presentation on whether less lethal weapons should be utilized.",47,,
493,0.97,3412.142,3418.548,Where we can join is that what's been happening Úright now is not working and there has to be changes with policies.,47,,
494,0.97,3418.548,3424.988,I think we're willing like the CDC said to participate in moving that forward.,47,,
495,0.97,3424.988,3433.763,I'm not going to spend much time on the background because it was pretty well covered by Council member Herbold.,48,,
496,0.97,3433.763,3436.332,I'm going to move to this process.,48,,
497,0.97,3436.332,3450.079,"During the analysis of these issues and response to the Council's request, we interviewed those involved in the process, people at SPC.",48,,
498,0.97,3450.079,3458.888,We talked to OPA staff about what they were seeing in the investigation they were seeing.,48,,
499,0.97,3458.888,3462.158,We were able to identify trends we were seeing in cases.,48,,
500,0.97,3462.158,3473.303,"We looked at studies on the use of impact weapons, the various policies, Swat Manuel, Internet action plans created for the early days of the protests.",48,,
501,0.97,3473.303,3485.315,We looked at use of force data generated by officers in response to protests as well as both community member and body worn Video that showed what was happening on the grounds.,48,,
502,0.97,3485.315,3498.494,We also looked at past uses of force and now Noncrowd control content to inform our decision on whether these things should be authorized for control operations.,48,,
503,0.97,3498.494,3507.737,First and foremost our recommendation was that all less lethal tools be Thoracicked for Noncrowd control situations.,49,,
504,0.97,3507.737,3511.04,What I mean is either patrol or Swat operation.,49,,
505,0.97,3511.04,3523.72,"It's important to note within the first recommendation that for tear gas, we are not saying it should be authorized for patrol in our mind.",49,,
506,0.97,3523.72,3526.222,Patrols should never be using cs gas.,49,,
507,0.97,3526.222,3530.393,The times the it is used should be incredibly limited.,49,,
508,0.97,3530.393,3534.13,There are times that Swat may use cs gas.,49,,
509,0.97,3534.13,3544.741,That is used in a very targeted manner often for Barricaded subjects and also for the sole purpose of avoiding the needs to use a higher level of deadly force.,49,,
510,0.97,3544.741,3546.809,I want to be clear.,49,,
511,0.97,3546.809,3551.347,What we're not saying is cs gas should be available to patrol.,49,,
512,0.97,3551.347,3552.348,It should never be available.,49,,
513,0.97,3552.348,3564.16,The second point was authorizing the use of new restrictions set forth in our memo of less lethal tools except for crowd control situations.,49,,
514,0.97,3564.16,3569.832,"Within that, we came up with recommendations.",49,,
515,0.97,3569.832,3570.466,These are fairly preliminary.,49,,
516,0.97,3570.466,3574.47,Recommendations are coming up as we see them.,49,,
517,0.97,3574.47,3582.011,We're going through cases and continually evaluating what went right and wrongs to build on recommendations.,49,,
518,0.97,3582.011,3596.893,"First and foremost, if we do reauthorize these tools and that would be up to the Constitution of the be up to the Council.",49,,
519,0.97,3596.893,3599.729,It would be to prevent officers from using less lethal tools.,49,,
520,0.97,3599.729,3607.27,"That goes to the point for tools to be used, there needs to be an imminent threat of harm to persons.",49,,
521,0.97,3607.27,3611.207,There's the cost of breaking of windows and obstruction to property.,49,,
522,0.97,3611.207,3620.516,"When you balance risk of harm from less lethal tools, it's important to focus on harm to people before they're utilized.",49,,
523,0.97,3620.516,3627.423,"One gap we saw preliminarily, plans generated by commanders were not particularly detailed.",49,,
524,0.97,3627.423,3629.025,We think that's a problem.,49,,
525,0.97,3629.025,3634.497,It prevents having officers having guidance to know when they should and shouldn't be using tools.,49,,
526,0.97,3634.497,3638.601,We would urge the Department to create more detailed planning.,49,,
527,0.97,3638.601,3647.377,That planning would be available to the public through public disclosure and hopefully Voltaire disclosure by the Department.,49,,
528,0.97,3647.377,3658.554,We also saw these protests were different than other protests so far as they were focused towards law enforcement and real anger towards law enforcement.,50,,
529,0.97,3658.554,3668.197,What we believe is that SPD needs to consider whether this is the case minimizing their presence and interaction with protestors.,50,,
530,0.97,3668.197,3669.732,That may mean staying to the side.,50,,
531,0.97,3669.732,3676.139,It may mean not being front and center in protests.,50,,
532,0.97,3676.139,3678.141,Just being there may exacerbate the process.,50,,
533,0.97,3678.141,3684.714,"Another thing we've seen the lack of communication between demonstrators, police and vice versa.",50,,
534,0.97,3684.714,3693.923,"What we're suggesting is to have more robust communication, portable address system to let people know what's going on in the crowds.",50,,
535,0.97,3693.923,3704.434,I think it's obviously unfair to expect that if you have a crowd of 2000 that everyone in that crowd may hear in order to disperse.,50,,
536,0.97,3704.434,3712.308,Insuring that is done effectively to allow people to hear the order and leave.,50,,
537,0.97,3712.308,3718.448,"What we're requesting, this is not something we have recommendations on.",50,,
538,0.97,3718.448,3742.071,Spd working with experts and community groups is explore the feasibility to allow them to arrest people within crowds who engage in criminal activity I think that's what we saw with some of the early days for the protests where you have thousands of people and perhaps 25 to 30 people in those crowds engaging in criminal activity.,50,,
539,0.97,3742.071,3747.977,The result was disperse the crowd instead of extracting the criminal activity.,50,,
540,0.97,3747.977,3748.444,This is difficult.,50,,
541,0.97,3748.444,3753.149,I don't know of Department that knows how to do this or done this in a good way.,50,,
542,0.97,3753.149,3757.753,We're asking you to think outside the box and explore tactics that allow.,50,,
543,0.97,3757.753,3766.229,Again to continue to allow the people that are peaceful to demonstrate and observe their person rights.,50,,
544,0.97,3766.229,3769.031,Will the last point was executive approval process.,50,,
545,0.97,3769.031,3775.371,We don't think this is a good idea for a couple reasons.,50,,
546,0.97,3775.371,3785.915,"First, it was unclear whether what was asked for by the Council was a process that the Mayor would approve the less lethal tools or what the command approval was.",50,,
547,0.97,3785.915,3802.999,"If it's the Mayor, we don't think it's a good idea to have a political entity to make decisions as to when less lethal tools are you used used.",50,,
548,0.97,3802.999,3806.736,They may require expertise or knowledge not available to that individual.,50,,
549,0.97,3806.736,3808.137,We think that's a bad idea.,50,,
550,0.97,3808.137,3816.245,We think there could be conflicts with the city chart their have to be fixed before that could be done.,50,,
551,0.97,3816.245,3818.114,That's our presentation in a nutshell.,50,,
552,0.97,3818.114,3825.521,I'm happen by to answer questions including questions posed to us earlier by the Council.,50,,
553,0.97,3825.521,3827.423,Thank you.,51,,
554,0.97,3827.423,3836.265,Let's start like we did with the last presentation with inviting questions from Council members that are present.,51,,
555,0.97,3836.265,3856.052,"After that, I'll refer to the questions that were submitted in advance.",51,,
556,0.97,3856.052,3857.019,Looking for raised hands.,51,,
557,0.97,3857.019,3857.553,Council member Herbold.,51,,
558,0.97,3857.553,3861.891,I guess I'm not surprised by what the director said.,51,,
559,0.97,3861.891,3873.002,It's not new what we've heard but I still find it stunning and alarming at the same time.,51,,
560,0.97,3873.002,3894.624,"First of all, I would NOTE this presentation by director Marburg did not start with the important point, the premise that a lot of harm has been done to peaceful protestors including all the way up until a few days ago.",51,,
561,0.97,3894.624,3897.693,There was no mention of that whatsoever.,51,,
562,0.97,3897.693,3908.304,My main point here would be the office of personal accountability mandate to evaluate police misconduct.,51,,
563,0.97,3908.304,3918.948,I want to know how is it that ops actually done their job before they start advocating for cops to have more weapons.,51,,
564,0.97,3918.948,3931.427,"How many officers has the OPA held accountable for the violence and lies against the Protestor that resulted in 18,000 complaints?",51,,
565,0.97,3931.427,3937.967,What did OPA do about the officer who Maced a 17 year-old in the face.,51,,
566,0.97,3937.967,3941.337,You're holding for officers to be held accountable.,51,,
567,0.97,3941.337,3945.207,"What have you done to hold officers accountable for 18,000 complaints?",51,,
568,0.97,3945.207,3963.192,"How is it that not having done any of that work, you are basically saying that any kind of restrictions on the police despite this mountain of evidence, egregious behavior from them is problematic.",51,,
569,0.97,3963.192,3968.097,You're also raising--your saying I don't know what this means.,51,,
570,0.97,3968.097,3971.1,I don't know how to implement.,51,,
571,0.97,3971.1,3973.169,I don't take this at face value.,51,,
572,0.97,3973.169,3976.339,It's problematic and really deeply troubling Devin where we are.,51,,
573,0.97,3976.339,3980.676,This is not ten years ago.,51,,
574,0.97,3980.676,3986.716,This is today after everything that's happened.,51,,
575,0.97,3986.716,3988.284,I would like honest answers here.,51,,
576,0.97,3988.284,3989.418,Thank you.,51,,
577,0.97,3989.418,3991.687,You asked me a lot of questions.,52,,
578,0.97,3991.687,3999.662,"Before you start, I want to say--I want you to hear director Mireburg.",53,,
579,0.97,3999.662,4011.107,I heard you preface comment with the fact you reviewed complaints you've been receiving and that those complaints that allowed you to identify particular patterns and trends.,53,,
580,0.97,4011.107,4020.516,I just want to--you may not have used the exact words Council member Sawant wanted you to use.,53,,
581,0.97,4020.516,4033.729,I feel you conveyed the message that the complaints your receiving from the public are informing the recommendations you're making.,53,,
582,0.97,4033.729,4037.266,I want the record to reflect that.,53,,
583,0.97,4037.266,4052.415,So what I'll say--thank you Council member Herbold and thank you for your questions.,54,,
584,0.97,4052.415,4054.717,We've received 87 cases for now.,54,,
585,0.97,4054.717,4056.819,We're in the process of issuing findings.,54,,
586,0.97,4056.819,4060.823,We expect the first round of findings will come out next Friday.,54,,
587,0.97,4060.823,4063.592,Those will be made public to everyone including the city council.,54,,
588,0.97,4063.592,4067.797,There will be cases in which officers are found to have violated policy.,54,,
589,0.97,4067.797,4074.637,There's cases in which they'll be found to not have violated policy.,54,,
590,0.97,4074.637,4078.541,There are cases in which protestors have been injured.,54,,
591,0.97,4078.541,4080.009,That's extremely unfortunate.,54,,
592,0.97,4080.009,4089.652,That's not something we're happy about or something we're wanting to continue and we're going to do our best obviously.,54,,
593,0.97,4089.652,4091.187,We're only one part of the system.,54,,
594,0.97,4091.187,4097.86,"That being said, I don't look at it as a buy their conversation like you're trying to make now.",54,,
595,0.97,4097.86,4106.335,"From my perspective, there are protests where on some occasions like may 30th and may 31st, they may turn into scenes of violence.",54,,
596,0.97,4106.335,4109.305,You may have cars burned in the street.,54,,
597,0.97,4109.305,4113.843,There may be times that SPD will be required to disperse protests.,54,,
598,0.97,4113.843,4118.848,I'm saying that there should be tools that allow SPD to do so.,54,,
599,0.97,4118.848,4122.685,I'm not saying the usage of tools in every situation is okay.,54,,
600,0.97,4122.685,4124.62,It's not.,54,,
601,0.97,4124.62,4133.262,"To take all tools away and expect that the city in a dire situation could be kept safe, I think that's unreasonable.",54,,
602,0.97,4133.262,4140.402,The Ordnance passed by the city council is incredibly broad.,54,,
603,0.97,4140.402,4144.373,It removed tools from patrol operations.,54,,
604,0.97,4144.373,4155.284,You said in response Councilmember Sawant you wanted about for patrol officers to use less than deadly force in situations where someone presented a threat.,54,,
605,0.97,4155.284,4157.82,"Without the lethal tools, it's very difficult to do so.",54,,
606,0.97,4157.82,4164.894,If someone had a knife on the street and were 25 to 100 feet from a patrol officer.,54,,
607,0.97,4164.894,4170.833,"If they were trained, they would use the device to disarm the person.",54,,
608,0.97,4170.833,4173.335,It's a purpose to prevent higher levels of force.,54,,
609,0.97,4173.335,4179.208,I don't agree with your characterization of our presentation.,54,,
610,0.97,4179.208,4189.185,"I think from OPA's perspective, we're concerned with what's going on in the level of force used, amount of force used.",54,,
611,0.97,4189.185,4194.123,We're also concerned with damage and violence on both sides.,54,,
612,0.97,4194.123,4199.295,"Our job is look at the cases, video and Macon Collusions.",54,,
613,0.97,4199.295,4200.329,I certainly apologize.,54,,
614,0.97,4200.329,4203.165,"Frankly, we are swamped with complaints.",54,,
615,0.97,4203.165,4209.505,"As you mentioned, we received 18,000 individual complaints we had to go through one by one.",54,,
616,0.97,4209.505,4213.342,I'm not sure if you have follow up questions to ask me.,54,,
617,0.97,4213.342,4222.551,I want to follow up quickly on this Councilmember Herhold if that's okay?,55,,
618,0.97,4222.551,4225.054,"Yes, council member Sawant.",55,,
619,0.97,4225.054,4225.387,That's okay.,55,,
620,0.97,4225.387,4231.427,I find your response unacceptable director Marburg.,56,,
621,0.97,4231.427,4236.432,You say I'm trying to create a Binary picture.,56,,
622,0.97,4236.432,4237.833,That's not true.,56,,
623,0.97,4237.833,4241.37,Everything I said is based on statistical evidence.,56,,
624,0.97,4241.37,4242.538,This is a question of Statistics.,56,,
625,0.97,4242.538,4249.578,It's a question of where does the overwhelming evidence point toward?,56,,
626,0.97,4249.578,4250.045,That's the point.,56,,
627,0.97,4250.045,4260.322,You're in fact portraying a picture that not existing and hypothetical that the police Department and many politicians use.,56,,
628,0.97,4260.322,4262.725,It does not conform with reality.,56,,
629,0.97,4262.725,4271.0,Reality shows this is not a both side situation.,56,,
630,0.97,4271.0,4290.619,"That is completely in denial of the overwhelming statistical evidence from Seattle and every other city that when you look at protest movements, overwhelmingly violence and force comes from the police Department and also they have the weapons on their side.",56,,
631,0.97,4290.619,4297.76,"For example, I would not consider someone threw a water bottle at a police officer.",56,,
632,0.97,4297.76,4299.595,I'll advocate for not doing that.,56,,
633,0.97,4299.595,4303.732,The point is where does the overwhelming violence come from?,56,,
634,0.97,4303.732,4312.074,Ordinary people don't go around with tear gas canisters and blast balls and rubber bullets and all that sort of thing.,56,,
635,0.97,4312.074,4314.143,They're just there protesting.,56,,
636,0.97,4314.143,4316.311,"As I said, it's a question of Statistics.",56,,
637,0.97,4316.311,4323.085,"Overwhelming majority of the situation, what happens as peaceful protestors are targeted?",56,,
638,0.97,4323.085,4323.585,Movements are targeted?,56,,
639,0.97,4323.585,4324.653,It's not individual protestors.,56,,
640,0.97,4324.653,4330.759,It's a movement when it becomes a threat to the state.,56,,
641,0.97,4330.759,4336.598,The same sort of dishonest city is used with the less lethal.,56,,
642,0.97,4336.598,4338.367,I stand by what I said.,56,,
643,0.97,4338.367,4342.271,We need a reasonable and humane policy making approach.,56,,
644,0.97,4342.271,4350.612,Look at all the deaths that happened at the hands of police to patrol situations.,56,,
645,0.97,4350.612,4358.987,There isn't a law to say less than lethal approach to make sure the situation is brought under control without loss of life.,56,,
646,0.97,4358.987,4364.126,Why are lives lost?,56,,
647,0.97,4364.126,4368.063,There's no accountability there as well.,56,,
648,0.97,4368.063,4378.774,"While I obviously have agreement on the general premise, I think that there's a big distance in what is what you think needs to be done and I'm sure you're reflecting major Durkan position also.",56,,
649,0.97,4378.774,4379.541,It's not just about you.,56,,
650,0.97,4379.541,4381.577,It's political officials.,56,,
651,0.97,4381.577,4384.78,The buck stops with elected officials.,56,,
652,0.97,4384.78,4393.922,My position in the community's position and movement position is coming from a review of actual evidence which does not support the way you're portraying this situation.,56,,
653,0.97,4393.922,4394.223,Thank you.,56,,
654,0.97,4394.223,4396.225,I am hearing what your saying.,57,,
655,0.97,4396.225,4400.129,I don't know what your talking about as far as Statistics go.,57,,
656,0.97,4400.129,4406.635,There may be people that are looking at Thes cases on their own.,57,,
657,0.97,4406.635,4408.27,We're Evaluatings cases in the media.,57,,
658,0.97,4408.27,4414.676,We're evaluating and not just looking at one piece of video.,57,,
659,0.97,4414.676,4416.445,We're looking at all Video.,57,,
660,0.97,4416.445,4416.845,I understand.,57,,
661,0.97,4416.845,4417.946,You keep saying statistics.,57,,
662,0.97,4417.946,4421.016,I don't know what your talking about.,57,,
663,0.97,4421.016,4422.084,We're looking at the same evidence.,57,,
664,0.97,4422.084,4430.993,"If after the fact you think the findings are wrong, I welcome you to call them out.",57,,
665,0.97,4430.993,4432.294,We haven't yet reached findings.,57,,
666,0.97,4432.294,4435.264,I'm not sure how you reach determination on these things.,57,,
667,0.97,4435.264,4438.0,We're still looking at the cases.,57,,
668,0.97,4438.0,4438.267,Okay.,58,,
669,0.97,4438.267,4443.338,You look at the cases and tell us your findings.,58,,
670,0.97,4443.338,4443.639,Will do.,59,,
671,0.97,4443.639,4451.613,I think it could be for any of us to pretend all sides are back kind of situation.,60,,
672,0.97,4451.613,4453.749,We have seen overwhelming evidence.,60,,
673,0.97,4453.749,4463.725,"I'm talking about the overwhelming majority of accounts from ordinary people, people who weren't part of movements that testified in the hundreds in public comment.",60,,
674,0.97,4463.725,4466.728,Something this year that I haven't seen happen before.,60,,
675,0.97,4466.728,4469.865,People have personally said I'm not part of.,60,,
676,0.97,4469.865,4472.401,I'm not part of a political movement.,60,,
677,0.97,4472.401,4476.605,I'm here because my baby couldn't breathe because of the tear gas used.,60,,
678,0.97,4476.605,4482.644,I looked out from my flat on Capitol Hill and I saw the police starting the violence.,60,,
679,0.97,4482.644,4483.712,It's not one person.,60,,
680,0.97,4483.712,4484.713,It's overwhelming numbers of people.,60,,
681,0.97,4484.713,4490.519,This is something we see happening in every city.,60,,
682,0.97,4490.519,4492.888,The police are Tarting protest movements.,60,,
683,0.97,4492.888,4493.856,It's something we've seen for decades.,60,,
684,0.97,4493.856,4504.299,"While I agree that you should review cases and I'm happy to come back to the discussion, I also think it would be for you to say we don't flow what overwhelming evidence you're talking about.",60,,
685,0.97,4504.299,4511.406,We're talking about what happens on at a day-to-day basis.,60,,
686,0.97,4511.406,4515.577,Thank you Councilmember Sawant.,61,,
687,0.97,4515.577,4519.581,Other Councilmembers that have questions now?,62,,
688,0.97,4519.581,4520.816,Council President Gonzalez please.,62,,
689,0.97,4520.816,4523.285,Thank you.,63,,
690,0.97,4523.285,4530.959,I appreciate an opportunity to perhaps refocus on a issue at hand here.,63,,
691,0.97,4530.959,4558.52,"I'll just say I found that line of questioning not necessarily productive and helpful to moving us forward and identifying clear solutions to issues we're asked to consider which is in the instance of crowd control issues, what kind of less lethal weapons should be used if any at all?",63,,
692,0.97,4558.52,4579.174,"I appreciate director Mireburg the fact that you have spent--you and your staff have spent many, many hours as an independent agency that is civilian led looking at the evidence and materials available to you.",63,,
693,0.97,4579.174,4584.146,Materials and items not available to me as a council member.,63,,
694,0.97,4584.146,4586.815,To many members of the public.,63,,
695,0.97,4586.815,4597.025,"I have not had the benefit of reviewing 18,000 individual complaints and associated supporting information to each of those complaints.",63,,
696,0.97,4597.025,4633.862,"I'm not going to sit here as a council member Preend tending I know more than you because I don't as it relates to 18,000 civilian complaints filed with you as a result of what I think we all agree were instances of atrocious incidents in the field that were rightly referred to your office and are intended to be reviewed by your office.",63,,
697,0.97,4633.862,4641.236,I continue to stand by your independence . I disagree with the ongoing attempt to undermine our accountability system for political purposes.,63,,
698,0.97,4641.236,4647.542,I'm just--I really reject that attempt.,63,,
699,0.97,4647.542,4652.314,I apologize and feel Regretful that it's occurring.,63,,
700,0.97,4652.314,4673.068,"It's appropriate for policy makers to ask you all tough questions to make sure you stay accountable and make sure you stay independent, but I also want to say on the record, I have a high level of confidence in the office of police accountability and office of Inspector general.",63,,
701,0.97,4673.068,4686.515,I have a high level of confidence in the Seattle police Commission to do what we asked you all to do when we unanimously passed the police accountability Ordnance in 2017.,63,,
702,0.97,4686.515,4694.222,I want to focus more on one of the big statements I heard you back at the top of your presentation.,63,,
703,0.97,4694.222,4711.406,"Even though there are Micro differences between the three reports from the accountability entities, at the end of the day, you like the others believe that the status quo of how SPD is managing crowds is not working.",63,,
704,0.97,4711.406,4714.309,There needs to be change.,63,,
705,0.97,4714.309,4715.31,Did I hear that correctly?,63,,
706,0.97,4715.31,4715.51,Yes.,63,,
707,0.97,4715.51,4715.744,Agreed.,63,,
708,0.97,4715.744,4729.891,One thing I'd like to hear more from you about is this issue of related to the standard of when crowd control weapons should be used.,64,,
709,0.97,4729.891,4744.005,One thing you said one of the recommendations is we shouldn't be using these kinds of indiscriminate weapons when there is only property damage occurring.,64,,
710,0.97,4744.005,4751.046,This is a subject of great debate amongst the city.,64,,
711,0.97,4751.046,4756.384,One spectrum says property should be protected at all costs.,64,,
712,0.97,4756.384,4767.896,There's another side of that spectrum that says property damage should be tolerated because we don't want to put property damage above life and serious bodily harm.,64,,
713,0.97,4767.896,4787.549,"I just want from your seat as an expert in this area, I want you to have an opportunity to talk to us in more detail about what you mean when you say that these weapons shouldn't be used unless there's imminent harm to people.",65,,
714,0.97,4787.549,4794.99,Perhaps you can give us examples and more texture reasonable doubt that Nuanced analysis.,65,,
715,0.97,4794.99,4798.426,Thank you for the question.,66,,
716,0.97,4798.426,4809.07,"From right now, the policy says that a command staff member have give an order to disperse and utilize less lethal tools.",66,,
717,0.97,4809.07,4818.613,It allows individual officers to make a discretionary decision to use less lethal tools including blast balls and pepper spray.,66,,
718,0.97,4818.613,4831.193,It allows them to do so not just a threat to safety or a person's safety or imminent threat of danger but also property damage.,66,,
719,0.97,4831.193,4833.128,Remove the discretion from officers in that regard.,66,,
720,0.97,4833.128,4844.439,All that's going to do in our minds is create more wiggle room and confusion for officers as to when they can utilize blast balls.,66,,
721,0.97,4844.439,4849.377,We're not minimizing the risk of harm from blast balls.,66,,
722,0.97,4849.377,4850.579,There's a risk of harm.,66,,
723,0.97,4850.579,4851.913,That is an uncomfortable risk.,66,,
724,0.97,4851.913,4854.082,We don't like that risk.,66,,
725,0.97,4854.082,4859.287,What we're doing is balancing that risk against other risks of harm to people.,66,,
726,0.97,4859.287,4867.062,How do you balance those two and that's what we're struggling with in our report and evaluation of this policy.,66,,
727,0.97,4867.062,4885.747,What we're saying is remove the individual discretion from officers to use lies blast balls or tools solely to stop a window from being broken or a rock being thrown at a store front or a Dumpster being moved in the middle of the street.,66,,
728,0.97,4885.747,4886.147,Stop doing that.,66,,
729,0.97,4886.147,4900.395,"If there's for example--if officers for example are getting hit in the face by rocks or in the body with rocks and need to move the crowd back, we don't think they should be prohibited to move the crowd back.",66,,
730,0.97,4900.395,4904.633,You cannot use blast balls in a matter not Chained and appropriate.,66,,
731,0.97,4904.633,4912.24,What we've seen from cases is your seeing the use of blast balls in potentially inappropriate manners.,66,,
732,0.97,4912.24,4913.241,Those cases result in discipline.,66,,
733,0.97,4913.241,4915.443,Those cases then result in other policy changes.,66,,
734,0.97,4915.443,4920.515,"For example, you should not throw a blast ball at another human being.",66,,
735,0.97,4920.515,4922.15,Those are not to target people.,66,,
736,0.97,4922.15,4929.224,To roll them on the grown to prevent space and prevent you from being hit with an object.,66,,
737,0.97,4929.224,4932.494,"Rhyme talking rocks, bricks, other things that have occurred during protest.",66,,
738,0.97,4932.494,4938.733,That could be the place to use those tools.,66,,
739,0.97,4938.733,4948.71,"If Council is going in direction tools are banned, let's work on a way to make that happen consistent with best practices, consistent with the process approved to all parties that need to approve it.",66,,
740,0.97,4948.71,4954.149,We're happy to be part of that process.,66,,
741,0.97,4954.149,4957.218,We agree the community needs to be involved too.,66,,
742,0.97,4957.218,4961.823,We cannot do this at a government policy level.,66,,
743,0.97,4961.823,4963.892,That didn't work in the past.,66,,
744,0.97,4963.892,4968.697,I would take CPC lead on how to integrate lead on this process.,66,,
745,0.97,4968.697,4971.766,The that's not my expertise.,66,,
746,0.97,4971.766,4972.767,I think that's important.,66,,
747,0.97,4972.767,4975.403,Perhaps that will come out in the Oig will put on.,66,,
748,0.97,4975.403,4983.211,All these I think this will come to light and recommendation will flow from that.,66,,
749,0.97,4983.211,4986.848,It's fundamentally where most of us are on the same page.,66,,
750,0.97,4986.848,4996.424,We should not use these types of tools that have risk of harm solely to prevent breaking of windows.,66,,
751,0.97,4996.424,5001.463,You have to balance the need to protect the possible harm that can flow.,66,,
752,0.97,5001.463,5006.201,I appreciate that additional information and clarification.,67,,
753,0.97,5006.201,5022.183,"As it relates to riots and the Declaration of riots, one of the things you said is you do not agree.",67,,
754,0.97,5022.183,5025.987,It was my understanding.,67,,
755,0.97,5025.987,5027.055,I could be wrong.,67,,
756,0.97,5027.055,5028.089,Please let me know.,67,,
757,0.97,5028.089,5043.838,There was some statutory language that at least seems to create an inference that there already is an executive executive approval process for when a riot is declared.,67,,
758,0.97,5043.838,5062.357,I wanted to hear a little more from you about how do you reconcile your opinion with that and sort of how do you--help us thread the needle around all of these moving pieces as it relates to what I think is the goal here.,67,,
759,0.97,5062.357,5073.268,How do we make the process and the standards for declaring a riot which sort of does create a massive exception for when these tools can be used?,67,,
760,0.97,5073.268,5102.03,"How do we create an increased level of transparency and accountability and standardization in those contexts in order to feel confident and give the public confidence that when the police does declare a riot that it, that there has been some due process and diligence executed before getting to that opponent.",67,,
761,0.97,5102.03,5107.435,"One of the issues was when you frame it in that respect, I understand more what the ask is.",67,,
762,0.97,5107.435,5118.513,Part of the confusion I have is it wasn't clear whether the Council was asking for.,67,,
763,0.97,5118.513,5123.051,"When we discuss the accountability entities, there was confusion on what was asked for.",68,,
764,0.97,5123.051,5137.665,I don't think it would be a bad idea to have some sort of executive approval for the riot declaration in so far as you're right.,68,,
765,0.97,5137.665,5140.802,It could be curfews or restriction of firearms.,68,,
766,0.97,5140.802,5141.336,You could do that.,68,,
767,0.97,5141.336,5155.35,The concern OPA had was are you having Mayoral staff take a phone call and make a tactical decision as to whether or not they're going to use least lethal tools.,68,,
768,0.97,5155.35,5162.457,"That from our perspective, we did not think that was a good idea.",68,,
769,0.97,5162.457,5167.862,We thought it was volatile of the city charter.,68,,
770,0.97,5167.862,5179.908,"I don't have have if same concerns on a riot declaration, particularly given the CPC criticism of how broad that is.",68,,
771,0.97,5179.908,5182.443,It was narrowed to a situation there was a true riot.,68,,
772,0.97,5182.443,5194.956,I think that would be a good idea to have some sort of process review by the executive.,68,,
773,0.97,5194.956,5197.792,"So, perhaps I misunderstood the ask.",68,,
774,0.97,5197.792,5198.493,Apologies for that.,68,,
775,0.97,5198.493,5199.561,I'm not sure you misunderstood the ask.,68,,
776,0.97,5199.561,5220.949,I think what I was trying to get was an understanding of whether that was an approval process or just limited to the tactical questions that you highlighted.,68,,
777,0.97,5220.949,5223.251,I appreciate that.,68,,
778,0.97,5223.251,5228.156,Those the chief of police of Charter.,69,,
779,0.97,5228.156,5233.528,"You can change the Charter, but I worry there's conflict.",69,,
780,0.97,5233.528,5233.895,Thank you.,70,,
781,0.97,5233.895,5235.263,"Great, thank you.",71,,
782,0.97,5235.263,5242.103,I'm going to turn to questions that were submitted in advance by Council members.,71,,
783,0.97,5242.103,5257.885,The first is that both OPA and Oig reports recommend that the Council reauthorize all less lethal weapons for Noncrowd control situations.,71,,
784,0.97,5257.885,5267.295,Just wondering what level of definition do you recommend that we use for defining Noncrowd control situations.,71,,
785,0.97,5267.295,5290.585,"Do you recommend we define them and if so, do you recommend we do so as a way of describing the situations as you have a hostage scenario, armed barricade suspect, suicide by cop or do you recommend that we define them as to the who?",71,,
786,0.97,5290.585,5295.99,I just want all three questions out at once if I could.,71,,
787,0.97,5295.99,5296.524,Thanks.,71,,
788,0.97,5296.524,5306.1,The second question is what recommendations do OPA have for targeted arrests during demonstrations in response to law enforcement?,71,,
789,0.97,5306.1,5311.639,The last relates back to the question of blast balls.,71,,
790,0.97,5311.639,5328.289,Would like to understand a little more about why given that Oig understands blast balls have the indiscriminate inflicting pain on peaceful protestors.,71,,
791,0.97,5328.289,5331.592,Cpc has a long standing occurrence of this opinion.,71,,
792,0.97,5331.592,5338.032,I think their recommendations on blast balls go back to 2017.,71,,
793,0.97,5338.032,5341.336,Believe they should be banned for Noncrowd and crowd situations.,71,,
794,0.97,5341.336,5352.78,Just asking that you get more into the details about why you reinstated for crowd control.,71,,
795,0.97,5352.78,5362.09,You could use categories for when the less lethal tools were used.,72,,
796,0.97,5362.09,5364.392,I think the questions were narrow.,72,,
797,0.97,5364.392,5372.133,"For example, armed and Barricaded subject, that would not include someone with a knife on a city street confronted by patrol.",72,,
798,0.97,5372.133,5373.201,Patrol officers are trained.,72,,
799,0.97,5373.201,5377.338,There are certain officers trained to use that 40 mill meet every launcher.,72,,
800,0.97,5377.338,5383.177,"In my mind, I think about the less lethal tools.",72,,
801,0.97,5383.177,5384.645,That for me Isless important.,72,,
802,0.97,5384.645,5391.219,That's the difference of someone shot and killed versus shot with a foam bullet.,72,,
803,0.97,5391.219,5395.123,"If you were to include categories or the people that utilize them, that's fine.",72,,
804,0.97,5395.123,5406.701,I want to work with the Council and other Stakeholders in what categories are.,72,,
805,0.97,5406.701,5411.739,The reason I ask -,72,,
806,0.97,5411.739,5412.64,You're muted Councilmember.,73,,
807,0.97,5412.64,5456.451,"The reason I ask is this is a concept that I introduced in the original pass only of the legislation, the recognition use of these weapons and Noncrowd control situations might be warranted whereas in my belief they were not and used in the instance of demonstrations and when I tried to introduce that concept into the Ordnance itself, you recall as Council member Sawant, again mentioned today there's concern that just simply saying Noncrowd control situations becomes this huge loophole.",74,,
808,0.97,5456.451,5465.46,I agree it's important to figure out a way to define it and it's the Noncrowd control situation is not abused.,74,,
809,0.97,5465.46,5476.838,It's definable and certainly we can work with what that looks like.,75,,
810,0.97,5476.838,5481.943,"Anecdotally, we looked at 11 incidents it was used.",75,,
811,0.97,5481.943,5482.577,It's not used often.,75,,
812,0.97,5482.577,5486.047,"In most situations, someone was armed with a knife.",75,,
813,0.97,5486.047,5489.917,They were able to disarm the person without any other force being used.,75,,
814,0.97,5489.917,5494.755,We want to make sure the tool and I'm happy to provide you with cases.,75,,
815,0.97,5494.755,5501.963,It's an important tool to utilize to insure that less harm is used.,75,,
816,0.97,5501.963,5509.237,However you're going to present in the Ordnance.,75,,
817,0.97,5509.237,5511.439,Tat's within the Council's discretion.,75,,
818,0.97,5511.439,5519.08,That would lead to utilize it in situations someone is armed with a deadly weapon and sole alternative is higher level of force.,75,,
819,0.97,5519.08,5520.248,That's what I strongly suggest.,75,,
820,0.97,5520.248,5531.726,"The other questions, there was a question we received about the different recommend Commendations made by OPA and other accountability entities.",76,,
821,0.97,5531.726,5538.499,Would it make sense to create a new policy?,76,,
822,0.97,5538.499,5538.866,Absolutely.,76,,
823,0.97,5538.866,5540.001,You could implement the existing policy.,76,,
824,0.97,5540.001,5549.577,"Regardless, we would very much want--we would certainly want recommendations to be considered if not implemented.",76,,
825,0.97,5549.577,5555.449,"For blast balls, I agree.",76,,
826,0.97,5555.449,5563.257,I don't think it's disputable blast balls can and do cause injuries.,76,,
827,0.97,5563.257,5564.792,That is a fact.,76,,
828,0.97,5564.792,5566.928,All less lethal tools can cause injuries.,76,,
829,0.97,5566.928,5572.533,We've seen injuries caused from pepper spray and reactions to pepper spray.,76,,
830,0.97,5572.533,5582.043,The foam tip Ed from the launcher can cause bruises on people's legs.,76,,
831,0.97,5582.043,5582.843,They do cause injuries.,76,,
832,0.97,5582.843,5585.613,We understand they do.,76,,
833,0.97,5585.613,5590.318,If a crowd is violent and I'm not saying all crowds do.,76,,
834,0.97,5590.318,5595.59,How is SPD going to disperse that crowd if they have to?,76,,
835,0.97,5595.59,5600.761,Putting in new restrictions.,76,,
836,0.97,5600.761,5601.629,Less need for crowds to be dispersed.,76,,
837,0.97,5601.629,5604.165,Eliminating line officers.,76,,
838,0.97,5604.165,5610.071,"Even if all things were put in place, there's times that a crowd may have to be dispersed.",76,,
839,0.97,5610.071,5612.139,How are we going to have officer Doss that?,76,,
840,0.97,5612.139,5620.481,"If there's a risk of harm to people, how do we make sure it's done in a way that doesn't involve officers going in the crowd and going hands on with people.",76,,
841,0.97,5620.481,5622.216,That the is not a good situation.,76,,
842,0.97,5622.216,5632.66,The that's where we get into trouble in the first place in 2011 when DOJ came in to be criticized use for impact weapons and Batons.,76,,
843,0.97,5632.66,5635.997,We don't want to use Batons.,76,,
844,0.97,5635.997,5638.232,That's the Ugh Havele we're having.,76,,
845,0.97,5638.232,5639.433,I don't like blast balls.,76,,
846,0.97,5639.433,5661.789,I don't know of other tools and tactics that can replace those in working together to come up with tactics.,76,,
847,0.97,5664.558,5669.563,? I have two questions.,76,,
848,0.97,5669.563,5697.558,"Director, we're talking about the need to disperse a crowd without least lethal weapons.",76,,
849,0.97,5703.798,5704.398,This marks appropriate any way.,76,,
850,0.97,5704.398,5713.574,So my first question is how do you reconcile those recommendations.,76,,
851,0.97,5713.574,5726.787,My second question is I know we're trying to look at this from an system's perspective and how this operates.,76,,
852,0.97,5726.787,5744.638,I'm interested to know what information we have over the last few months about the record I guess I'm imagining a Matrix or table of something talking about how many times riots were declared.,76,,
853,0.97,5744.638,5750.01,How often different kinds of weapons were used.,76,,
854,0.97,5750.01,5754.849,How many different outcomes of violence we had.,76,,
855,0.97,5754.849,5760.921,I'm interested to know how often that happened with particular incident commanders.,76,,
856,0.97,5760.921,5773.801,"How do we tie these patterns together so we start to see was it particular officers, was it more likely to happen at a particular time of day?",76,,
857,0.97,5773.801,5785.779,I just want to understand the Ecosystem of things that led to these outcomes.,76,,
858,0.97,5785.779,5788.249,I think so.,76,,
859,0.97,5788.249,5790.417,Your first question is really good.,76,,
860,0.97,5790.417,5796.69,"From my perspective, we do see two types of protests generally when we're evaluating the cases.",76,,
861,0.97,5796.69,5806.967,You see the more static stationary protests like you mentioned Council member Morales versus a more possibly protest.,76,,
862,0.97,5806.967,5828.989,I think one of the reasons we had come up with our recommendation for extraction from crowds was because we agree that the way that protests are done historically were the way SPC police protests does not work in those static situations.,76,,
863,0.97,5828.989,5836.263,How can you better police protests to eliminate people engaging in criminal activity allowing the protests to remain?,76,,
864,0.97,5836.263,5840.935,"In rare situations, I agree with you.",76,,
865,0.97,5840.935,5844.772,Those types of tools are not useful for situations.,76,,
866,0.97,5844.772,5853.581,Can you develop tactics better purposed for those situations?,76,,
867,0.97,5853.581,5855.583,Both Oig had recommendations.,76,,
868,0.97,5855.583,5857.718,I don't know what those tactics are.,76,,
869,0.97,5857.718,5860.621,I'm hopeful Seattle can innovate and figure out what that is.,76,,
870,0.97,5860.621,5865.759,I guess I could see what your saying in they're contradictory in a way.,76,,
871,0.97,5865.759,5876.503,I guess what I'm saying is there are times that you may have to disperse a crowd through those means through less lethal tool.,76,,
872,0.97,5876.503,5878.606,That may be appropriate.,76,,
873,0.97,5878.606,5883.577,Other time you may want to disperse a crowd where less lethal tools are not available.,76,,
874,0.97,5883.577,5899.26,To have options available to you that Opd didn't have in first rounds of protests would be a huge step in the right direction.,76,,
875,0.97,5899.26,5907.101,They do have tools to Deescalate whether than form a line in riot gear and respond in a quick way because someone opened an umbrella.,77,,
876,0.97,5907.101,5911.572,That's what we're trying to figure out.,77,,
877,0.97,5911.572,5911.872,Agreed.,78,,
878,0.97,5911.872,5921.615,"That's one of our recommendations, right, in situations where you know you're the target of the protest, do not go out there and face the protestors.",78,,
879,0.97,5921.615,5922.917,"Pull back, remain in the background.",78,,
880,0.97,5922.917,5923.384,Let people protest.,78,,
881,0.97,5923.384,5930.224,"I think that was something when we look at protests, that is something that probably went wrong.",78,,
882,0.97,5930.224,5944.338,To not allow people to protest and March caused artificial blockages that created these friction points which did not result in a manner that anyone was happy with in the city.,78,,
883,0.97,5944.338,5945.239,You're right.,78,,
884,0.97,5945.239,5946.54,Everything you're saying is true.,78,,
885,0.97,5946.54,5954.415,There are multiple things that SPD could have done better during protests.,78,,
886,0.97,5954.415,5956.15,We're still evaluating them.,78,,
887,0.97,5956.15,5962.856,These are things we've determined in initial round of cases being evaluated.,78,,
888,0.97,5962.856,5979.707,"This may be off point, but is there a time particularly with experiences we're having now where we've had over 10 0 days of protests.",79,,
889,0.97,5979.707,5991.919,"It's appropriate for the accountability partners outside of a formal investigation to say Hey, we've been watching this for months now.",79,,
890,0.97,5991.919,5998.926,We keep seeing the same issue and making a public statement.,79,,
891,0.97,5998.926,5999.46,"For instance, labor day.",79,,
892,0.97,5999.46,6008.469,That's another example where police officers were the political target of protests.,79,,
893,0.97,6008.469,6016.41,"By coming out, and for no parent reason I could see confronting the protestors.",79,,
894,0.97,6016.41,6017.911,Then chasing them through the city.,79,,
895,0.97,6017.911,6027.888,I just feel like that again.,79,,
896,0.97,6027.888,6030.357,We're in this cycle.,79,,
897,0.97,6030.357,6057.551,"There are certain things repeated in the cycle . to discuss changes in policy . If this is the best way to go to disrupt what we're seeing happening, continuing to happen in real time.",79,,
898,0.97,6057.551,6063.557,I think it's a valid point and something we meet regularly and discuss things all the time.,80,,
899,0.97,6063.557,6073.967,We're trying to figure out what to do now regularly in communication with SPD command staff and others expressing concerns and what I'm seeing.,80,,
900,0.97,6073.967,6078.138,Our questions will come out on a rolling basis.,80,,
901,0.97,6078.138,6085.679,We'll be able to inform tactics and activities engaged by SPD.,80,,
902,0.97,6085.679,6091.318,It may very be there's a time and place for that occurring and it's now.,80,,
903,0.97,6091.318,6094.888,"It's something I'll discuss with Lisa, IG judge and brandy grant.",80,,
904,0.97,6094.888,6104.298,One thing you mentioned that I wanted to get to quickly is officers utilizing the force and the commanders that are supervising.,80,,
905,0.97,6104.298,6118.045,It tends to be some similarities because of staffing like off with bicycle officers and other officers that tend to have the same commanders given where it's occurring in precincts.,80,,
906,0.97,6118.045,6119.446,We'll identify that.,80,,
907,0.97,6119.446,6126.22,Oig will look at the numbers of the amount of force that was used and when it was used.,80,,
908,0.97,6126.22,6131.558,They're creating my understanding IG judge and Mary can address this.,80,,
909,0.97,6131.558,6142.169,They're creating a time line for application of use of force and protest incidents that occurred.,80,,
910,0.97,6142.169,6149.443,We'll be able to man that out to identify trends in personnel as well.,80,,
911,0.97,6149.443,6149.676,Great.,80,,
912,0.97,6149.676,6151.578,I want to echo what the chair said.,80,,
913,0.97,6151.578,6162.89,"It's been clear to be a change in tactics, increased escalation over the last 100 days.",80,,
914,0.97,6162.89,6167.594,"For the community, it is really not satisfied with being told file a report.",80,,
915,0.97,6167.594,6170.597,That doesn't disrupt the behavior that is happening.,80,,
916,0.97,6170.597,6179.806,People are getting injured for over and over again and the pattern of behavior continues.,80,,
917,0.97,6179.806,6205.933,I'm also really interested in understanding if there's a way for accountability organizations to step in and disrupt something like that when there is more that needs to be done than for the public to wait for a report and a process to happen so we can prevent injury.,80,,
918,0.97,6205.933,6206.934,Thank you.,81,,
919,0.97,6206.934,6208.268,We have one more presentation.,81,,
920,0.97,6208.268,6210.904,That is from Inspector General judge.,81,,
921,0.97,6210.904,6215.676,I'd like to hand over to the inspector general.,81,,
922,0.97,6215.676,6218.512,Good morning Madame chair.,82,,
923,0.97,6218.512,6219.646,Madame president and Council members.,82,,
924,0.97,6219.646,6228.889,Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak to you this morning.,82,,
925,0.97,6228.889,6231.124,Our report was given.,82,,
926,0.97,6231.124,6234.194,I have more slide than my partners that proceeded me.,82,,
927,0.97,6234.194,6237.864,I'll try to move through as quickly as I can.,82,,
928,0.97,6237.864,6243.57,I tried to answer questions in advance of the slides.,82,,
929,0.97,6243.57,6246.607,Hopefully many questions will be addressed in the presentation.,82,,
930,0.97,6246.607,6253.18,I'll leave open room at the end.,82,,
931,0.97,6253.18,6265.359,"If I could start by Commenting on Council member Morales question, I appreciate her raising that issue and acknowledging the urgency of the situation and watching the same Dynamics happening over and over again.",82,,
932,0.97,6265.359,6268.562,I'd like to add to what director Mireburg said.,82,,
933,0.97,6268.562,6272.466,Our recommendations are out there.,82,,
934,0.97,6272.466,6273.066,It's not a secret.,82,,
935,0.97,6273.066,6276.47,We've identified issues that could be actionable Oday.,82,,
936,0.97,6276.47,6282.275,They're written in reports submitted to Council and the Mayor and made public.,82,,
937,0.97,6282.275,6286.179,Those provide a frame work for a consideration that could happen any time.,82,,
938,0.97,6286.179,6292.452,We need to be mindful a new monitor was appointed.,82,,
939,0.97,6292.452,6296.59,The court has weighed in on this issue.,82,,
940,0.97,6296.59,6314.041,I'd be supportive of a conversation soon about these issues involving the monitor and other Stakeholders to try to provide immediate feedback about potential changes to approaches.,82,,
941,0.97,6314.041,6314.941,Thank you Council member Morales.,82,,
942,0.97,6314.941,6315.375,I appreciate that.,82,,
943,0.97,6315.375,6321.348,"If we could move to the first slide, I'll speak to overview of what we're doing.",83,,
944,0.97,6321.348,6322.449,We're all here.,83,,
945,0.97,6322.449,6331.525,We agree the right to peacefully assemble is critical to our democracy and society.,83,,
946,0.97,6331.525,6343.57,"Accountability partners and all of you are here because we want to make sure people coming here are here to express outrage, grief, other feelings act racial injustice.",83,,
947,0.97,6343.57,6350.41,It's their right proof Texted to come out and do that.,83,,
948,0.97,6350.41,6368.562,I'll say there's a lot of agreement with my partner and others the use of least lethal weapons should be used on protestors.,83,,
949,0.97,6368.562,6382.943,I appreciate the comments made already about the need to address specific acts of violence or disperse a declare riot.,83,,
950,0.97,6382.943,6392.085,We can focus on having meaningful criteria about when it's declared.,83,,
951,0.97,6392.085,6405.065,"When there are acts of violence that are specified and identified individuals are committing those acts of violence, police need tools to address this.",83,,
952,0.97,6405.065,6417.944,I echo the sentiment's Express that SPD should work on tactics to target those particular acts and move them out of an otherwise peaceful crowd.,83,,
953,0.97,6417.944,6419.446,The crowds rights can be facilitated.,83,,
954,0.97,6419.446,6430.69,One thing that needs to be highlighted in policy development is approach needs to be one of Facilitation of first amendment rights and not of control of crowds and control of Messaging.,83,,
955,0.97,6430.69,6442.169,I would hope that that would be the beacon for whatever frame work we come up with here.,83,,
956,0.97,6442.169,6448.608,We continue to believe least lethal tools are important to address high risk calls outside the context.,83,,
957,0.97,6448.608,6463.457,I'll weigh in since the question has come up already with both of my colleagues.,83,,
958,0.97,6463.457,6486.146,It's probably a better request for Council to broadly define what crowd management and crowd control means and have restrictions on less lethal weapons tied to that rather than trying too figure out the universe where have less lethal weapons are appropriate.,83,,
959,0.97,6486.146,6499.426,It would be my recommendation to focus on defining what protected first amendment activity means and whatever restrictions are put in place on less lethal weapons in first amendment context.,83,,
960,0.97,6499.426,6506.9,"Just to kind of wrap it up, we support retaining less lethal weapons for SPD.",83,,
961,0.97,6506.9,6516.209,"With strict criteria within a crowd control context and squad context, making sure folks are properly trained and policies are adequate.",83,,
962,0.97,6516.209,6527.12,One of the things that I've heard discussed and I think is a critical issue is strong needs for accountability on the back end of those.,83,,
963,0.97,6527.12,6532.859,We have already processes for individual officer policy violations and misconduct.,83,,
964,0.97,6532.859,6544.905,"We definitely saw a gap in accountability for command level decision making and declaring riots, authorizing large scale uses of force and having some way to go back and look at decisions.",83,,
965,0.97,6544.905,6549.376,"I think the council member Morales, your questions got to issues.",83,,
966,0.97,6549.376,6562.422,We will be looking at that further and making recommendations and hopefully assisting with policy development.,83,,
967,0.97,6562.422,6564.591,If you could move the slide.,83,,
968,0.97,6564.591,6578.705,"In terms of the authorization of less lethal weapons, the Ordnance should be retracted to distinguish to control functions and crowd management uses of less lethal force.",83,,
969,0.97,6578.705,6583.41,We talked about this next bullet.,83,,
970,0.97,6583.41,6588.782,I won't spend time on that.,83,,
971,0.97,6588.782,6601.194,The director talked about having weapons available when higher levels of force might be inappropriate or undesirable.,84,,
972,0.97,6601.194,6604.13,My notes pages just turned off.,84,,
973,0.97,6604.13,6606.199,Let me get my computer back on.,84,,
974,0.97,6606.199,6606.399,Okay.,84,,
975,0.97,6606.399,6625.819,"I think we all understand that if you ban certain weapons without providing some alternatives to using higher force, especially without providing opportunity to decide what replacement strategies will be in place, it may end up resulting in violence.",84,,
976,0.97,6625.819,6628.622,We're hopeful any solutions we arrive at will avoid that.,84,,
977,0.97,6628.622,6632.425,If you could move the slide please.,84,,
978,0.97,6632.425,6641.635,"In terms of specific tools that we want to talk about, first of all with regard to blast balls.",84,,
979,0.97,6641.635,6655.882,"Any decision about whether they should be Reauthorized should come with a strong recommendation that SPD follow up on all the previous external recommendations they've received concerning blast balls, CPC.",84,,
980,0.97,6655.882,6669.329,I believe this dates back to 2016 and other external sources made a lot of recommendations about blast balls and their use and proper use in training.,84,,
981,0.97,6669.329,6672.198,Those recommendations need to be Revisited.,84,,
982,0.97,6672.198,6676.569,We should insure SPD acted on those previous recommendations.,84,,
983,0.97,6676.569,6680.106,That's a starting point for any sort of reauthorization of blast balls.,84,,
984,0.97,6680.106,6685.545,I would highlight that Oig is concerned about them.,84,,
985,0.97,6685.545,6687.213,They're explosive devices.,84,,
986,0.97,6687.213,6694.621,"If not used strictly in accordance with recommendations or training, they can cause a lot of injury, potentially deaf.",84,,
987,0.97,6694.621,6702.462,I think any reauthorization of those needs to be done with great care and previous recommendations.,84,,
988,0.97,6702.462,6703.43,Moving onto tear gas.,85,,
989,0.97,6703.43,6708.134,Oig supports a ban on those in any general protest setting.,85,,
990,0.97,6708.134,6723.95,"If there was any reauthorization of tear gas, it should be if a riot has been declared and I completely agree there need to be specific criteria about the Declaration of a riot.",85,,
991,0.97,6723.95,6736.262,There needs to be an acknowledgment by who are is the commander that the circumstances meet criteria and there needs to be accountability for decision making.,85,,
992,0.97,6736.262,6753.646,"In circumstances, that would be the only potential whether something like tear gas while effective, they're to be considered--there's so many other things that argue against its use.",85,,
993,0.97,6753.646,6761.02,"If it was a tool of last resort, Rewould never support for use in residential areas.",85,,
994,0.97,6761.02,6773.666,The minute particular nature of the gas different from OC spray allows it to seep into things and cause significant secondary impacts to people who are completely innocent.,85,,
995,0.97,6773.666,6781.608,We saw that with complaints of cs gas seeping into residents in Capitol Hill.,85,,
996,0.97,6781.608,6795.421,Of I think the recommendations for my colleagues it not be Reauthorized are sound.,85,,
997,0.97,6795.421,6801.528,We would support that.,85,,
998,0.97,6801.528,6810.103,Officers have to receive adequate use on gas and how to contaminate.,85,,
999,0.97,6810.103,6823.716,Other things we found in our work leading up to this is SPD personnel frequently received some training so that it makes them qualified for using less lethal weapons.,85,,
1000,0.97,6823.716,6827.22,They frequently don't have adequate opportunities to practice with some of these tools.,85,,
1001,0.97,6827.22,6833.526,I'll talk a little about that later if I've got time.,85,,
1002,0.97,6833.526,6845.672,"Also, they need to avoid using expired munitions and they should be addition posing of unsafe stock they have which we detected was going on.",85,,
1003,0.97,6845.672,6848.341,"Mary, if you could move the slide.",85,,
1004,0.97,6848.341,6850.91,So that's really the recommendations we have.,85,,
1005,0.97,6850.91,6853.446,They're specific to less lethal weapons.,85,,
1006,0.97,6853.446,6876.402,"What we did was like OPA, we conducted interviews and did a lot of research into SPD crowd management policy and other agencies to provide context around the force used and perhaps why certain things wasn't rye and there were improper uses of force.",85,,
1007,0.97,6876.402,6882.742,Just to mention SPD's crowd management policy is in line with most major cities.,85,,
1008,0.97,6882.742,6885.144,It wasn't an Outlier in any way.,85,,
1009,0.97,6885.144,6889.415,Not to say it's the one we want here.,85,,
1010,0.97,6889.415,6893.72,There isn't anything on it that Diverges from most major cities.,85,,
1011,0.97,6893.72,6893.92,Mary?,85,,
1012,0.97,6893.92,6915.908,We found that--I think this really gets to the Ssue of communication and making sure that officers and incident commanders have clear criteria when force is appropriate and making sure they communicate with individuals and with the crowd to make sure people have an understanding of what's happening.,85,,
1013,0.97,6915.908,6929.789,What we found is that officers were perhaps perceiving risks and Dieing they needed to use force or incident commander was authorizing or directing force.,85,,
1014,0.97,6929.789,6936.429,It resulted in the crowd not understanding what was going on and viewing that action as illegitimate.,85,,
1015,0.97,6936.429,6946.239,That serving to escalate the crowd and increase tensions and violent acts creating this vicious cycle of escalation with the crowds.,85,,
1016,0.97,6946.239,6960.086,One of the things we identified as a critical Fature of development is better communication with the crowd.,85,,
1017,0.97,6960.086,6975.201,So this is alluded to in the number of ways.,86,,
1018,0.97,6975.201,6981.207,"Talking act crowd Dynamics, at what stage certain levels of force may or may not be appropriate.",86,,
1019,0.97,6981.207,7006.399,We feel like perhaps a Matrix that breaks down crowd Dynamics and certain levels and makes it very clear what force may or may not be appropriate or perhaps just a much more detailed policy would be assist Ing to officers so they know what criteria is in place for using force.,86,,
1020,0.97,7006.399,7013.94,It reduces the discretion me nay otherwise have to make force decisions in unclear ambiguous circumstances.,86,,
1021,0.97,7013.94,7021.714,"So, the other thing and I will harp on this a lot is requiring communication with the crowd is critical.",86,,
1022,0.97,7021.714,7032.892,One thing is requiring warnings to crowds before there's any attempt to disperse or before there's any use of less lethal weapons.,86,,
1023,0.97,7032.892,7034.627,It's one way to minimize escalation.,86,,
1024,0.97,7034.627,7040.033,Policies have exemptions for emergency situations or whatever.,86,,
1025,0.97,7040.033,7046.038,"Those exemptions, if they are present in the situation need to be documented.",86,,
1026,0.97,7046.038,7050.476,There needs to be basis for not providing a warning.,86,,
1027,0.97,7050.476,7053.279,"Along with giving warnings, this boils down to due process.",86,,
1028,0.97,7053.279,7059.452,It's the giving people of notice of what's about to happen to them and giving them meaningful opportunity to respond to that notice.,86,,
1029,0.97,7059.452,7065.324,"If you're going to issue an order to disperse a crowd, you're going to have to make sure the crowd hears it, understand it.",86,,
1030,0.97,7065.324,7071.998,You have to do in a variety of ways to let as many people know what's happening as possible.,86,,
1031,0.97,7071.998,7077.136,Give them a meaningful amount of time to disperse.,86,,
1032,0.97,7077.136,7082.775,Give them meaningful avenues to disperse.,86,,
1033,0.97,7082.775,7088.381,Don't engage in Kettling or doing things like that.,86,,
1034,0.97,7088.381,7092.418,Don't shut down public transportation so they have to way to get out and get home.,86,,
1035,0.97,7092.418,7111.537,There's a variety of things that go into this bullet that are critical in giving people an understanding of what's happening and giving them the opportunity to respond before force is used on them and police action is taken.,86,,
1036,0.97,7111.537,7116.309,"Mary, if you could move the slide.",86,,
1037,0.97,7116.309,7118.711,"Again communication, communication, communication.",86,,
1038,0.97,7118.711,7126.085,What we have sort of proposed is traditional Decase Haitian tactics don't work with large crowds.,86,,
1039,0.97,7126.085,7151.244,"Really the way you would Deescalate a crowd is to reduce presence to reduce lines and Officerrers standing out in hard gear and find ways to meaningfully communicate with the crowd, before crisis occurs and ongoing during any mass demonstration.",86,,
1040,0.97,7151.244,7158.818,"With regard to communicating before a crisis, we suggested and found a couple jurisdictions that have done.",86,,
1041,0.97,7158.818,7175.401,"If you know something happening or may bring people out in masses to demonstrate, running public safety announcements or doing something to educate people about their first amendment rights and what may happen if riots are declared.",86,,
1042,0.97,7175.401,7187.413,We found in Minneapolis in 2016 they did that with a situation they were about to announce prosecution decisions regarding the police shooting of Clark.,86,,
1043,0.97,7187.413,7191.551,They did Psas to try to manage folks.,86,,
1044,0.97,7191.551,7205.698,I think what comes out of some experiences that we read about is making sure that you're answering questions that community might have and not just what officers or government wants people to know.,86,,
1045,0.97,7205.698,7216.409,For pushing out information to allow people to make decisions about their behavior and give them prior notice of things that may potentially happen.,86,,
1046,0.97,7216.409,7226.018,"So in terms of communicating during a mass demonstration, we suggest using a variety of different methods.",86,,
1047,0.97,7226.018,7226.986,Sound amplification is critical.,86,,
1048,0.97,7226.986,7230.022,There's sometimes sound is ineffective means of communication.,86,,
1049,0.97,7230.022,7230.957,There may be folks that can't hear.,86,,
1050,0.97,7230.957,7237.063,There may be noises in the crowd that make it ineffective.,86,,
1051,0.97,7237.063,7246.606,"Also using visual communication, pushing out information on social media or other things are a way to do that.",86,,
1052,0.97,7246.606,7247.44,If you'll move along.,86,,
1053,0.97,7247.44,7251.877,There are various jurisdictions that use things like.,86,,
1054,0.97,7251.877,7261.187,These are examples of Oakland police Department's visual communication boards in a recent protest what you'll notice is they're low and small.,86,,
1055,0.97,7261.187,7269.962,"Unless you've got them up high or got a bunch of them, this is not going to be super effective.",86,,
1056,0.97,7269.962,7280.773,There are probably decent targets for folks that want to cause damage.,86,,
1057,0.97,7280.773,7285.244,You could print large banners that could be hoisted or brought down.,86,,
1058,0.97,7285.244,7290.416,You can--there are many ways to imagine doing visual communication.,86,,
1059,0.97,7290.416,7298.858,It's important to give people options to know what's going on in managing a crowd.,86,,
1060,0.97,7298.858,7299.225,All right.,87,,
1061,0.97,7299.225,7310.002,We talked a little about this about officers having few opportunities to practice.,87,,
1062,0.97,7310.002,7326.585,"We think if SPD can retain weapons, having them provide opportunities for Officerrers to practice them might reduce the risk of high stress situations.",87,,
1063,0.97,7326.585,7335.961,"Mary, go ahead.",87,,
1064,0.97,7335.961,7350.776,"We found they already understand a lot about crowd management, tactics, and that using fixed riot lines served to escalate crowds.",87,,
1065,0.97,7350.776,7354.013,They limit opportunities for Deescalation.,87,,
1066,0.97,7354.013,7354.313,They know.,87,,
1067,0.97,7354.313,7375.301,Spd like most agencies in have not come up with a solution for dealing with large static crowds gathered in one place and can't be made mobile or moving.,87,,
1068,0.97,7375.301,7376.836,What we've seen here happened this summer.,87,,
1069,0.97,7376.836,7386.112,Now they're left with guidance on how to deal with crowds in fixed locations.,87,,
1070,0.97,7386.112,7391.083,That's one of the things the director mentioned.,87,,
1071,0.97,7391.083,7395.054,We would have to come up with ways to approach.,87,,
1072,0.97,7395.054,7420.613,"One is that you approach it with, like I said, the Facilitation that you do it in stages or in graded ways where if you're going to have officer presence, you can have officers in soft uniforms who come out.",87,,
1073,0.97,7420.613,7423.849,If officer presence is necessary.,87,,
1074,0.97,7423.849,7463.055,"Violence to otherwise left the crowd continue with gathering and expressing first amendment rights or if it Deinvolves into a situation where an actual riot is declared, you've got other personnel Samed to move in and handle that that aren't standing around serving to escalate the crowd all throughout.",87,,
1075,0.97,7478.938,7491.951,For having targeted enforcement capability for people who are committing isolated violent incidents in a crowd to otherwise allow the peaceful crowd to remain.,87,,
1076,0.97,7491.951,7495.287,To improve communication with crowds.,87,,
1077,0.97,7495.287,7495.488,Mary?,87,,
1078,0.97,7495.488,7499.058,This is really kind of a issue that's something to consider.,87,,
1079,0.97,7499.058,7518.21,"One of the things we saw was that with not being able to have appropriate levels of staffing for some of these events, officers seem to then resort to reliance on less lethal tools when they didn't have enough folks.",87,,
1080,0.97,7518.21,7538.631,Spd did not have sufficient staffing to manage the protest this is summer.,87,,
1081,0.97,7546.005,7554.446,Obviously this creates a risk the public is subjected to a force outside the norms and standards.,87,,
1082,0.97,7554.446,7582.641,One of the things we highlighted as a potential solution if mutual aid is used in the future is there's some sort of regional solution to at the at least insure prompt.,87,,
1083,0.97,7585.11,7589.448,"If we could pick up the pace, that would be fantastic.",88,,
1084,0.97,7589.448,7592.284,We can skip this slide.,89,,
1085,0.97,7592.284,7602.027,We can actually probably--let's see if there's anything else I want to highlight here.,89,,
1086,0.97,7602.027,7604.296,"Nope, you can skip this one Mary.",89,,
1087,0.97,7604.296,7620.779,We suggested SPD try to do outreach after things and provide information very soon after the fact when there has been protest response that resulted in impacts on public trusts.,89,,
1088,0.97,7620.779,7636.462,We suggest they try to use less technical language and not Overblow situations that fend to Delegitimize what they're doing.,89,,
1089,0.97,7636.462,7648.44,Those kinds of things in communications don't Ingender public trusts.,89,,
1090,0.97,7648.44,7650.609,We're highlighting that that kind of communication.,89,,
1091,0.97,7650.609,7653.379,"Go to the next slide, Mary.",89,,
1092,0.97,7653.379,7659.385,"With regard to external authorization, we're not supportive of that.",89,,
1093,0.97,7659.385,7663.922,"I think Councilmember Herbold, we were confused what was being asked.",89,,
1094,0.97,7663.922,7675.734,"Really, the bigger issue for us is if you're contacting somebody externally to get authorization, they're already relying on information provided by police.",89,,
1095,0.97,7675.734,7689.615,"If the concern is you don't trust information from police, don't trust decisions made by police, the information will then be Biased if communicated to a third party who's not there.",89,,
1096,0.97,7689.615,7691.75,There's a risk in that.,89,,
1097,0.97,7691.75,7709.735,"There may be time constraints where if it's a life safety emergency, you don't have time to do that.",89,,
1098,0.97,7709.735,7713.605,As has been identified already.,89,,
1099,0.97,7713.605,7714.64,This is a slide about review.,89,,
1100,0.97,7714.64,7718.944,We'll talk about that in a later time.,89,,
1101,0.97,7718.944,7719.445,That's my presentation.,89,,
1102,0.97,7719.445,7727.052,Hopefully I caught much of the information from the Council questions previously provided in the presentation.,89,,
1103,0.97,7727.052,7727.653,You definitely did.,90,,
1104,0.97,7727.653,7728.32,Thank you.,90,,
1105,0.97,7728.32,7732.858,I will not have any questions to offer.,90,,
1106,0.97,7732.858,7749.041,I do ask my colleagues on the committee whether or not they have questions at this time.,90,,
1107,0.97,7749.041,7751.443,All right.,90,,
1108,0.97,7751.443,7751.81,Council member?,90,,
1109,0.97,7751.81,7758.083,Thank you so much . I'm also happy to defer to other Council members.,90,,
1110,0.97,7758.083,7760.085,I ask one quick question if that's okay.,90,,
1111,0.97,7760.085,7762.387,Thank you very much director for your presentation.,90,,
1112,0.97,7762.387,7769.261,I didn't get a chance to say thank you to director Mireburg back on as well.,90,,
1113,0.97,7769.261,7778.704,I wanted to ask a quick question that relates to recommendations from both bodies.,90,,
1114,0.97,7778.704,7802.661,"Director Mireburg mentioned one mechanic commendation, the nature of the recent protest was directed to excessive use of force from police officer across the country resulted in one of the recommendations to stop having police officers sort of present a hard line and stop exacerbating the protests or escalating the protests.",90,,
1115,0.97,7802.661,7813.105,"You mentioned one of the things to do was clear communication, Psas, signs.",90,,
1116,0.97,7813.105,7818.443,My concern based on the data and reports I'm seeing nationally and this is not just Seattle.,90,,
1117,0.97,7818.443,7833.425,I'm going to ask you specifically about any indication you have for Seattle is that the response to the protests was escalated because police use of force was being questioned.,90,,
1118,0.97,7833.425,7834.66,You saw excessive police use of force.,90,,
1119,0.97,7834.66,7852.244,"I'm wondering--I've seen reports across the nation talking about this, can you comment on them as indication you have that there was excessive use of force because of the nature of concerns around police use of force being the target of the protest.",90,,
1120,0.97,7852.244,7862.354,I want to make a distinction between the use of force versus officers what people are protest as good excessive use of force.,90,,
1121,0.97,7862.354,7882.507,Can you comment on the local Department respond and if it was excessive excess there were instances.,90,,
1122,0.97,7882.507,7885.811,It's clear officers came out with a strong presence.,90,,
1123,0.97,7885.811,7905.13,One thing we observed and noted in our report was that the mission of SPD seeped to change dramatically when the protests became--I don't think they were expecting Anker and outrage expressed at police.,90,,
1124,0.97,7905.13,7908.834,"In most previous protests, it's been a different issue.",90,,
1125,0.97,7908.834,7920.412,Police have been able to largely avoid becoming the issue as long as they were using appropriate tactics and not individual--in other ways Inflaming the crowd.,90,,
1126,0.97,7920.412,7929.554,I don't think they were prepared to be the subject of outrage and expression.,90,,
1127,0.97,7929.554,7948.74,We did see actual changes in their plans and approaches when it game apparent the anger was directed at them specifically.,90,,
1128,0.97,7981.974,8009.701,To stand out there and take pretty hard stuff that's directed at institution of policing but still remain professional and still approach it with the belief this person has the absolute right to express that and be protected and expressing that.,90,,
1129,0.97,8009.701,8010.168,Councilmember Sawant?,90,,
1130,0.97,8010.168,8019.444,"For that presentation, I have several questions I'll go over and ask all at once.",90,,
1131,0.97,8019.444,8031.723,"I would also in addition to your verbal responses if you have any, that's also fine.",90,,
1132,0.97,8031.723,8036.728,I want to first clarify for members of the public that have been watching.,90,,
1133,0.97,8036.728,8044.469,Councilmember Gonzalez says she has confidence in the structure that have been set up.,90,,
1134,0.97,8044.469,8050.308,I just want to clarify that I do not share her confidence.,90,,
1135,0.97,8050.308,8054.746,The office office of Inspector general are part of the executive branch of government.,90,,
1136,0.97,8054.746,8063.388,We have seen Mayor Durkan's approach and her political positions many of these crucial issues.,90,,
1137,0.97,8063.388,8065.924,These are not minor issues.,90,,
1138,0.97,8065.924,8076.268,"These are questions of indiscriminate violence targeted at peaceful protestors and at protests actions by children, elderly, women are present.",90,,
1139,0.97,8076.268,8083.975,This is in response to the ongoing police violence that is especially racially Biased.,90,,
1140,0.97,8083.975,8089.481,So these are foot small issues we're talking about.,90,,
1141,0.97,8089.481,8092.05,It's correct that elected representatives should be asking hard questions.,90,,
1142,0.97,8092.05,8096.955,It's not just about you as individual directors of these departments.,90,,
1143,0.97,8096.955,8102.594,That's why the people are protesting against the system itself.,90,,
1144,0.97,8102.594,8114.739,"They understand that ultimately the rock is at the core of the system of capitalism, state it needs to keep protest movements Inic.",90,,
1145,0.97,8114.739,8118.143,That's the context we're talking about.,90,,
1146,0.97,8118.143,8121.179,That's also not an academic point.,90,,
1147,0.97,8121.179,8135.861,It's also an observed--observation of people that the reason these agencies have not been able to actually bring about accountability is because they are called accountability organizations.,90,,
1148,0.97,8135.861,8139.764,Their purpose is actually not to bring about accountability.,90,,
1149,0.97,8139.764,8141.633,It's important to examine the record.,90,,
1150,0.97,8141.633,8153.512,"I asked what steps have the organizations taken to increase accountability, not talk about it what has been done.",90,,
1151,0.97,8153.512,8159.518,The assessment is not has been done.,90,,
1152,0.97,8159.518,8164.389,I appreciate you saying.,90,,
1153,0.97,8164.389,8180.539,I think I heard you say you're not in favor of steps such as shutting down public transportation.,90,,
1154,0.97,8180.539,8183.575,I absolutely shut down public transportation is a terrible thing to do.,90,,
1155,0.97,8183.575,8192.183,It's not just the police Department and law enforcement agencies that are responsible for.,90,,
1156,0.97,8192.183,8194.419,The light rail shut down for example.,90,,
1157,0.97,8194.419,8202.694,On the day thousands of people courageously at the airport protesting against Trump's Muslim ban.,90,,
1158,0.97,8202.694,8204.829,Kettling should not be engaged in.,90,,
1159,0.97,8204.829,8205.931,They are violent practices.,90,,
1160,0.97,8205.931,8211.102,I Claire fire your position on that.,90,,
1161,0.97,8211.102,8235.66,The other thing is I'm quite surprised to say the at least to say that you're saying the police were not prepared to be the subject of protests.,90,,
1162,0.97,8235.66,8245.437,"A lot of things you said were as protests developed, it became sharp against the police, they had to respond.",90,,
1163,0.97,8245.437,8247.839,"Right of wrong, that was the context.",90,,
1164,0.97,8247.839,8249.641,That Wasnot the context.,90,,
1165,0.97,8249.641,8258.016,"For example, the 7-Year-Old Maced by the police happened on the first day of protests.",90,,
1166,0.97,8258.016,8259.618,"In other words, the first few hours.",90,,
1167,0.97,8259.618,8260.652,That's one of the many examples.,90,,
1168,0.97,8260.652,8263.555,I was there on that first day of protests.,90,,
1169,0.97,8263.555,8274.366,A lot of violent actions were taken by police.,90,,
1170,0.97,8274.366,8299.024,The other thing I want to clarify is you said that SPD did not have enough personnel.,91,,
1171,0.97,8299.024,8299.557,I don't understand that.,91,,
1172,0.97,8299.557,8304.262,There were 400 on the first day of the George Floyd protest.,91,,
1173,0.97,8304.262,8305.997,I think that's what the sentence said.,91,,
1174,0.97,8305.997,8306.264,Only 400?,91,,
1175,0.97,8306.264,8315.373,That's a question of what is your analysis Premised on.,91,,
1176,0.97,8315.373,8321.846,"If the police want to police a largely peaceful protest, why isn't that number enough?",91,,
1177,0.97,8321.846,8336.261,"Also I want to understand, I'm not understanding how do you square the claim that it wasn't sufficient personnel with the fact there was $6.3 million of overtime in the first 12 days of the protest.",91,,
1178,0.97,8336.261,8345.27,"Even if you didn't have individual officers in your view, not enough officers clearly a lot of public monies were spent on overtime.",91,,
1179,0.97,8345.27,8361.82,If you could just provide clarification on how you square two things.,91,,
1180,0.97,8366.358,8377.135,A clear guideline from police on what is going wrong or might go wrong so people in the movement understand what is going wrong.,91,,
1181,0.97,8377.135,8379.938,I understand all of that.,91,,
1182,0.97,8379.938,8388.413,I don't accept that is some sort of main or one of the important reasons the police failed in doing the right thing.,91,,
1183,0.97,8388.413,8390.014,There's many examples.,91,,
1184,0.97,8390.014,8398.123,I want to give you one example of the one of the protests nights at the 11th protest movement.,91,,
1185,0.97,8398.123,8400.892,This happened every night.,91,,
1186,0.97,8400.892,8405.263,I want to talk about one where nobody can say this was second hand evidence.,91,,
1187,0.97,8405.263,8406.564,I was there.,91,,
1188,0.97,8406.564,8410.034,I'm giving you first hand account.,91,,
1189,0.97,8410.034,8415.673,"The communication was audible, very loud.",91,,
1190,0.97,8415.673,8417.408,We could hear every word clearly.,91,,
1191,0.97,8417.408,8421.279,I never saw who the incident commander was.,91,,
1192,0.97,8421.279,8422.747,Wrong the police makes that clear.,91,,
1193,0.97,8422.747,8426.317,I don't know if that's my intention or not.,91,,
1194,0.97,8426.317,8427.352,That's the situation I saw.,91,,
1195,0.97,8427.352,8430.655,I couldn't see who was in charge.,91,,
1196,0.97,8430.655,8432.557,I heard the disembodied voice clearly.,91,,
1197,0.97,8432.557,8433.691,The problem was not the communication.,91,,
1198,0.97,8433.691,8436.394,"Yes, there were warnings and all of that.",91,,
1199,0.97,8436.394,8443.935,I agree that this communication and these warnings should be used to whatever extent possible to minimize escalation.,91,,
1200,0.97,8443.935,8451.009,The problem is that all that the movement was doing was marching forward step by step.,91,,
1201,0.97,8451.009,8452.911,They weren't engaging in any violence.,91,,
1202,0.97,8452.911,8460.852,The act of marching forward on a public street was considered escalation by police.,91,,
1203,0.97,8460.852,8463.388,The problem was not unclear communication.,91,,
1204,0.97,8463.388,8468.626,"The situation, there was a breakdown because of ordinary people, young people wanted a March forward.",91,,
1205,0.97,8468.626,8472.23,Police were not going to let them.,91,,
1206,0.97,8472.23,8473.198,That's when violence happened.,91,,
1207,0.97,8473.198,8483.141,"I hope you will also address how do you expect that that situation could have been, could have gone differently?",91,,
1208,0.97,8483.141,8492.183,"Just to let you know, minutes after that, there was tear gas, cs gas, whatever you want to call it, blast balls, absolute looked like a war zone minutes after.",91,,
1209,0.97,8492.183,8496.421,Thank you for those questions Councilmember Sawant.,92,,
1210,0.97,8496.421,8502.36,I would invite Inspector General judge to follow up after this meeting in answering Council member's Sawant's questions.,92,,
1211,0.97,8502.36,8513.004,I want to wrap up and talk about next steps and move on to our last item on the agenda before we start losing people.,92,,
1212,0.97,8513.004,8531.422,"Just in closing, the United States Department of justice you may recall obtained a temporary restraining order against the implementation of this ordinance per the 2012 consent decree.",92,,
1213,0.97,8531.422,8532.757,That case is ongoing.,92,,
1214,0.97,8532.757,8547.105,U.s. District Court Judge Robar requested the bodies to submit recommendation to him as well as our own requests in the Ordnance itself to receive these recommendations.,92,,
1215,0.97,8547.105,8559.25,"To allow for further consideration of our approach moving forward, there's been a request for a short extension of the current deadline set by the court.",92,,
1216,0.97,8559.25,8573.031,The court had previously ordered that the parties submit by September 12th analysis of the interaction with Ordnance of the decent decree as well as police Department policies that the consent Dedegree governs.,92,,
1217,0.97,8573.031,8580.171,The court governed that the parties respond to reports submitted by the OPA and IG.,92,,
1218,0.97,8580.171,8585.81,"In light of this work to be done, we recognize more time will be needed.",92,,
1219,0.97,8585.81,8608.032,"Again, it's important to remember that the current restrictions on the use of crowd control weapons that came from another temporary restraining order adopted by U.S. District Court sought by black lives matter and Alcu is in place.",92,,
1220,0.97,8608.032,8612.337,The injunction limiting the use of crowd controlled devices through September 30th.,92,,
1221,0.97,8612.337,8635.293,And on August 10th in response to a motion of contempt by black lives matter and Alcu the city agreed to expansion of the injunction to further limit the use of chemical Arrogants or Irrigations.,92,,
1222,0.97,8635.293,8644.669,Specified that declaring a riot does not exempt the city from obligations under this order.,92,,
1223,0.97,8644.669,8655.38,So there are lots of good questions about whether or not we're acting in accordance of this injunction but existence.,92,,
1224,0.97,8655.38,8678.369,I believe it does give us the about to continue also discussing what our legal approach is going to be moving forward.,92,,
1225,0.97,8678.369,8678.936,I look forward to hearing more.,92,,
1226,0.97,8695.486,8699.123,Committee item number two.,93,,
1227,0.97,8699.123,8701.592,This is the counsel bill.,93,,
1228,0.97,8701.592,8708.433,But that operation.,93,,
1229,0.97,8708.433,8714.138,The communication system authorized for the Technologies.,93,,

1243,0.97,8795.419,8801.692,This is over mostly supporting as well.,96,,
1244,0.97,8801.692,8811.435,The new system will continue to support over 100 agencies this is across the county.,96,,

1254,0.97,8852.476,8855.446,Good morning.,98,,
1255,0.97,8855.446,8859.25,Members of the city council.,98,,
1256,0.97,8859.25,8864.689,Thank you for allowing us just a few minutes to give a brief overview of that system.,98,,
1257,0.97,8864.689,8870.094,"But before I start, I do want to pause for a moment to recognize today's the 19th anniversary of 9/11.",98,,
1258,0.97,8870.094,8884.208,"Our country faced a very difficult times on the day we lost over 2900 people, 71 of those police officers and 343 firefighters.",98,,

1260,0.97,8890.715,8893.517,The Seattle fire Department this morning has had events honoring them.,98,,
1261,0.97,8893.517,8901.926,We read the names of all 343 firefighters.,98,,

1263,0.97,8903.427,8907.598,"So, I will start a presentation from there.",98,,
1264,0.97,8907.598,8912.904,Let's see right here.,98,,
1265,0.97,8912.904,8913.204,All right.,98,,
1266,0.97,8913.204,8915.706,I think I'm sharing my screen right now.,98,,
1267,0.97,8915.706,8920.344,"Okay, good.",99,,
1268,0.97,8920.344,8924.448,It's just a brief overview of the system.,100,,
1269,0.97,8924.448,8929.754,I could advance to the next slide.,100,,
1270,0.97,8929.754,8934.759,I will just talk briefly about what the Ila does.,100,,
1271,0.97,8934.759,8939.43,I will give a few project updates and then Kai will open it up for questions at the end.,100,,
1272,0.97,8939.43,8942.733,Lisa did a great job giving me overview.,100,,
1273,0.97,8942.733,8946.137,She covered some of those points that I will cover.,100,,
1274,0.97,8946.137,8959.15,What this does is authorizes the city of Seattle to enter an agreement with the county and 10 other agencies to actually stand up the nonprofit and card that is critical for us.,100,,
1275,0.97,8959.15,8961.585,We have been working on this project for a number of years now.,100,,
1276,0.97,8961.585,8964.288,We are coming to some critical points.,100,,
1277,0.97,8964.288,8971.395,They have those in the governor for operations.,100,,
1278,0.97,8971.395,8972.73,That's going to be important for us also.,100,,
1279,0.97,8972.73,8978.102,The city of Seattle will have one of four seats.,100,,
1280,0.97,8978.102,8984.775,In this instance the project has stood up a number of years ago.,100,,
1281,0.97,8984.775,8997.588,All parties are working to have signed inner local agreements I the end of September.,100,,
1282,0.97,9000.257,9001.826,That has been our goal.,100,,
1283,0.97,9001.826,9002.827,We are about 50% complete.,100,,
1284,0.97,9002.827,9006.13,Our current system is an analog radio system that was stood up in 1995 as they mentioned.,100,,
1285,0.97,9006.13,9010.034,"It has reached, and the life it is 25 years old.",100,,
1286,0.97,9010.034,9011.769,It is no longer being supported by our vendors.,100,,
1287,0.97,9011.769,9017.942,"The partners, you can see on the slide, we have Eastside agencies of the city of Seattle.",100,,
1288,0.97,9017.942,9023.447,We have our communication center agencies which is in another County.,100,,
1289,0.97,9023.447,9032.957,In Seattle the system is primarily used by the Seattle fire Department and the Seattle police Department as well as public works and other entities in the city.,100,,
1290,0.97,9032.957,9047.571,On the street right now it is 94% on the street coverage this will provide some improvements this is a Digital system operated by a single owner.,100,,
1291,0.97,9047.571,9056.047,"And, that is on 97% with a portable radio.",100,,
1292,0.97,9056.047,9059.216,That is a prayer and improvement of our current system.,100,,
1293,0.97,9059.216,9065.79,That is penetrating that coverage.,100,,
1294,0.97,9065.79,9076.1,This is providing that coverage in the city of Seattle we have about 240 buildings to improve our coverage.,100,,
1295,0.97,9076.1,9080.604,"You know, each day we are working to improve that just a bit more.",100,,
1296,0.97,9080.604,9084.175,"As Lisa mentioned, this was passed in 2015.",100,,
1297,0.97,9084.175,9090.114,It was passed by the voters here in King County that set aside funding to set up the system.,100,,
1298,0.97,9090.114,9095.886,The system will have 57 radio transmitter site route King County.,100,,
1299,0.97,9095.886,9104.195,Today we have 26 to 57.,100,,
1300,0.97,9104.195,9114.004,Also on top of that we made adjustments avidly have been moving along at four more covered sites that will be stood up for the additional coverage here.,100,,
1301,0.97,9114.004,9115.439,This is in Bellevue.,100,,
1302,0.97,9115.439,9122.146,"So, it is quite the expansive sensor.",100,,
1303,0.97,9122.146,9131.222,"All of those End-Users that will be using the system, and over 5000 of those users will be here in the city of Seattle.",100,,
1304,0.97,9131.222,9138.162,The voter approved measures have approved about $290 million to support this project.,100,,
1305,0.97,9138.162,9143.601,Right now we are on track with coming in on budget for the project.,100,,
1306,0.97,9143.601,9152.343,This map provides a general overview of the system and the different towers.,100,,
1307,0.97,9152.343,9162.153,All of the green dots on the screen are showing the hard work that they have been doing and building out all these towers.,100,,
1308,0.97,9162.153,9165.789,They have those sites under construction.,100,,
1309,0.97,9165.789,9175.099,"The only one in red, which is a very good sign for us right now, it is still being worked through in the escalation.",100,,
1310,0.97,9175.099,9183.407,You can see where the towers will be through the Eastern part of the county.,100,,
1311,0.97,9183.407,9193.117,We are going to have good coverage here when the system comes Online.,100,,
1312,0.97,9193.117,9194.351,What will they provide?,100,,
1313,0.97,9194.351,9194.952,Advanced Digital technology.,100,,
1314,0.97,9194.952,9196.086,"It will improve capacity, capability, and Connectivity.",100,,
1315,0.97,9196.086,9202.092,People may say that you get a clear radio transmission from a Digital system.,100,,
1316,0.97,9202.092,9210.134,It removes the background noise.,100,,
1317,0.97,9210.134,9214.238,That's the simple way I'd like to say it is it is a and versus FM radio.,100,,
1318,0.97,9214.238,9216.674,"Any time you click on that, it sounds a little bit cleaner.",100,,
1319,0.97,9216.674,9217.875,That's probably going to be important.,100,,
1320,0.97,9217.875,9222.046,A 20 year contract with our vendor is going to be important.,100,,
1321,0.97,9222.046,9231.422,They have the uniform operational requirements.,100,,
1322,0.97,9231.422,9238.462,"It's also going to have improved coverage throughout the county on highways two, four, 10 and 90.",100,,
1323,0.97,9238.462,9243.434,"As they transition with our different agreements, we will not lose any coverage.",100,,
1324,0.97,9243.434,9251.875,"An example of that is, we sent resources down South to help down in Sumner.",100,,
1325,0.97,9251.875,9259.383,They won't lose any of their Connectivity.,100,,
1326,0.97,9259.383,9260.351,These upgrades and repairs of both systems.,100,,
1327,0.97,9260.351,9265.089,That is going to be important for us.,100,,
1328,0.97,9265.089,9269.76,"As I mentioned earlier, over 17,000 new radios.",100,,
1329,0.97,9269.76,9271.795,That will be be deployed throughout the county.,100,,
1330,0.97,9271.795,9273.597,That's pretty significant.,100,,
1331,0.97,9273.597,9278.502,All of those agencies will be on the same radios.,100,,
1332,0.97,9278.502,9281.905,Infrastructure support is 24 seven.,100,,
1333,0.97,9281.905,9289.146,This project has been in the works for as you can see eight years now that started in August of 2012.,100,,
1334,0.97,9289.146,9295.419,You can identify a number of those milestones from the slides on the screen.,100,,
1335,0.97,9295.419,9298.622,But we have some more significant ones ahead of us.,100,,
1336,0.97,9298.622,9300.891,This is a significant step in standing up.,100,,
1337,0.97,9300.891,9303.427,So we can actually stand up the Operatr.,100,,
1338,0.97,9303.427,9314.705,"The next couple of years, we are going to make some large steps forward.",100,,
1339,0.97,9314.705,9315.639,This will reach full system acceptance.,100,,
1340,0.97,9315.639,9318.642,All of those will be very significant step.,100,,
1341,0.97,9318.642,9326.417,"Just to give you a brief update, 98% of our legal agreements are done.",100,,
1342,0.97,9326.417,9336.427,93% of the sites are constructed or are under constructed of our Motorola land equipment is now installed.,100,,
1343,0.97,9336.427,9341.732,That includes the link which transmits the radio signals.,100,,
1344,0.97,9341.732,9346.27,"So, we are really on a good place right now.",100,,
1345,0.97,9346.27,9354.478,The operator so far is 50% of the agencies they have signed.,101,,
1346,0.97,9354.478,9367.057,So six of the 12 hour goal is by the end of the month to get all 12 approved so that we can start to move forward with standing up.,101,,
1347,0.97,9367.057,9369.259,"So, that's a lot of work to do right there.",101,,
1348,0.97,9369.259,9377.0,The transfer of all assets or operations and maintenance the new agency will occur as we start to close out the project.,101,,
1349,0.97,9377.0,9382.072,"And, this will actually hit the it budget in 23 and 24.",101,,
1350,0.97,9382.072,9391.415,It will be a transfer of these that already paid for the existing radio maintenance and our existing radios.,101,,
1351,0.97,9391.415,9399.523,"So, the board of directors city of Seattle will have one vote.",101,,
1352,0.97,9399.523,9404.828,Currently I am the representative.,101,,
1353,0.97,9404.828,9409.833,That position the city of Seattle will still have a voting member.,101,,
1354,0.97,9409.833,9416.206,There will be two of them around the county.,101,,
1355,0.97,9416.206,9420.01,That's important because those agencies are the major users on the system.,101,,
1356,0.97,9420.01,9427.551,The executive director will run the day-to-day operations.,101,,
1357,0.97,9427.551,9434.324,The implications for that no longer responsible for maintaining the 800 Megahertz radio tower infrastructure.,101,,
1358,0.97,9434.324,9435.592,That will transfer to the operator.,101,,
1359,0.97,9435.592,9447.438,"The operator will manage the day-to-day business but, they will continue to support that portable radio for all those departments.",101,,
1360,0.97,9447.438,9459.383,They also allow the option to transfer Seattle technical staff to the operator to help with the maintenance and they had a future budget adjustments that will be required.,101,,
1361,0.97,9459.383,9465.889,As I mentioned on the previous side.,101,,
1362,0.97,9465.889,9466.757,That's all that I have.,101,,
1363,0.97,9466.757,9468.158,Are there any questions.,101,,
1364,0.97,9468.158,9472.396,Yes.,102,,
1365,0.97,9472.396,9477.267,I do have a couple of questions that I wanted to ask.,102,,
1366,0.97,9477.267,9482.406,I have two questions related to slide five.,102,,
1367,0.97,9482.406,9489.947,When you talk about 97% coverage at the street level are you talking about the geographical area?,102,,
1368,0.97,9489.947,9491.181,"Is at the city, King County?",102,,
1369,0.97,9491.181,9509.233,"And then, as it relates to the fact that they provide in building Repeaters with that code, is there a point at which building density or height makes getting a radio signal difficult?",102,,
1370,0.97,9509.233,9516.74,"And if so, I'm just wondering why it's only required by code if there is a major actions participating.",102,,
1371,0.97,9516.74,9526.149,I'm just wondering whether or not that is the opportunity for creating that consistency.,102,,
1372,0.97,9526.149,9527.551,"Lastly, actually, it's two more.",102,,
1373,0.97,9527.551,9540.43,For slide nine I wanted to make sure that those dates are accurate given the current public health crisis.,102,,
1374,0.97,9540.43,9545.168,"As it relates to the Decision- making body, those voting members could you speak to what happens?",102,,
1375,0.97,9545.168,9549.072,Okay.,103,,
1376,0.97,9549.072,9550.173,That was a lot of questions.,103,,
1377,0.97,9550.173,9568.358,"But the testing in the coverage, throughout the entire County from Seattle to Bellevue, and it will be I believe it is 2/10 of a mile increments.",103,,
1378,0.97,9568.358,9575.499,"Whether it is in downtown Seattle or Belleville, it will all be the same testing coverage.",103,,
1379,0.97,9575.499,9578.669,That is a 97% reliability from a portable radio.,103,,
1380,0.97,9578.669,9583.407,I have that right here from a portable radio if you are on the street.,103,,
1381,0.97,9583.407,9586.81,"So, that is the reliability.",103,,
1382,0.97,9586.81,9594.117,The same standards will be deployed throughout the entire County.,103,,
1383,0.97,9594.117,9599.289,"The second question, maybe you can refresh.",103,,
1384,0.97,9599.289,9600.29,Absolutely.,104,,
1385,0.97,9600.29,9618.742,It relates to the point of which building height or density might make radio signal receptions called and why is it that we are relying on building codes when there are so many different jurisdictions?,104,,
1386,0.97,9618.742,9627.851,Just wondering whether or not the agreement itself may create the opportunity for that consistency.,104,,
1387,0.97,9627.851,9635.359,"While the authority having jurisdiction adopted on fire codes here in Seattle, we have adopted the adjustments of our fire code.",105,,
1388,0.97,9635.359,9641.732,That is why we are Probbly further Downfield than some of the other agencies because we have adopted it.,105,,
1389,0.97,9641.732,9649.373,That is why we have approximately 240 buildings that already have those Eas systems.,105,,
1390,0.97,9649.373,9657.681,It is basically on the roof which a system runs through the building that connects to allow Additionalcoverage inside of the building.,105,,
1391,0.97,9657.681,9659.383,"The height, density, and materials make a difference.",105,,
1392,0.97,9659.383,9663.52,Our fire code lays that out.,105,,
1393,0.97,9663.52,9668.458,"As a matter of fact, as you can see, we have a number of buildings here.",105,,
1394,0.97,9668.458,9675.332,They are already moving forward with adding the systems.,105,,
1395,0.97,9675.332,9684.174,Our fire marshals are working with the other file marshaled in the county so hopefully we can get a uniform standard adopted.,105,,
1396,0.97,9684.174,9689.413,Thank you.,106,,
1397,0.97,9689.413,9692.983,"Then the last two questions, slide nine has a Timeline wondering when those dates are accurate.",106,,
1398,0.97,9692.983,9699.723,"And, given the governing body that has those members of what happened in the event of time?",106,,
1399,0.97,9699.723,9704.628,"So, the Timeline is still accurate.",107,,
1400,0.97,9704.628,9709.833,"If there are adjustments needed, we will make those adjustments.",107,,
1401,0.97,9709.833,9715.439,"The public health crisis, the Coronavirus health crisis slowed some of the construction.",107,,
1402,0.97,9715.439,9721.311,Adjustments were made and it continued to move forward.,107,,
1403,0.97,9721.311,9729.453,"It may not just be the public health crisis, construction has slowed because of some of the Wildfires taking place.",107,,
1404,0.97,9729.453,9734.257,So the teams can't get to the towers to finish the construction.,107,,
1405,0.97,9734.257,9735.358,They could be a variety of things.,107,,
1406,0.97,9735.358,9739.429,Generally the team adjust and that works itself out.,107,,
1407,0.97,9739.429,9747.571,"Then, the last one was you had one more question.",107,,
1408,0.97,9747.571,9749.072,The composition of the governing board.,108,,
1409,0.97,9749.072,9749.773,The number of boards.,108,,
1410,0.97,9749.773,9759.716,"Generally, most decisions have to be unanimous voting decisions.",109,,
1411,0.97,9759.716,9766.857,"So, within my three years of serving there, we actually haven't had a tie.",109,,
1412,0.97,9766.857,9774.164,The board works pretty hard to educate in the board members were really hard to accommodate.,109,,
1413,0.97,9774.164,9776.9,"Because, we are just not worried about Seattle.",109,,
1414,0.97,9776.9,9779.002,We are worried about the Eastside.,109,,
1415,0.97,9779.002,9781.404,"And, King County is worried about the entire County.",109,,
1416,0.97,9781.404,9788.712,It worked really hard to try to bring consensus together and we actually have an experience.,109,,
1417,0.97,9788.712,9789.179,The Mac understood.,109,,
1418,0.97,9789.179,9791.515,Thank you so much.,109,,
1419,0.97,9791.515,9800.69,Are there other questions?,110,,
1420,0.97,9800.69,9803.426,And the Councilmember Gonzalez.,110,,
1421,0.97,9803.426,9810.567,"Well, this is giving an opportunity as well.",111,,
1422,0.97,9810.567,9812.736,Thank you so much.,112,,
1423,0.97,9812.736,9822.045,"Well, there is an impasse resolution.",113,,
1424,0.97,9822.045,9822.279,Sorry.,113,,
1425,0.97,9822.279,9826.716,Let's figure out the right one.,113,,
1426,0.97,9826.716,9830.353,This is a decision that requires that.,113,,
1427,0.97,9830.353,9834.157,There is a provision for the mediation.,113,,
1428,0.97,9834.157,9838.128,For the escalation of that as well.,113,,
1429,0.97,9838.128,9840.63,These are more people to get involved in trying to resolve the issue.,113,,
1430,0.97,9840.63,9844.968,Thank you so much.,114,,
1431,0.97,9844.968,9852.576,I really appreciate the many years of work that has been required in the collaboration with the other jurisdictions.,114,,
1432,0.97,9852.576,9880.403,"And, both as it relates to actually getting the sites off as well as funding the project and you know, moving toward the then, all of those discussions that have been necessary to get us this far with the Interlocal agreement.",114,,
1433,0.97,9880.403,9886.009,I know that this has been a challenge and a very large and important project.,114,,
1434,0.97,9886.009,9898.622,It's really been appreciative and grateful for the work that they have done to get us to this point.,114,,
1435,0.97,9898.622,9910.634,"With that, I think that I will, if there are no further questions I will move to counts upon the bill.",115,,
1436,0.97,9910.634,9911.334,Thank you so much.,116,,
1437,0.97,9911.334,9915.238,All of those in favor of the passage of the bill 9879 police say aye.,116,,
1438,0.97,9915.238,9918.875,You have to call the roll.,117,,
1439,0.97,9918.875,9923.446,That's right.,118,,
1440,0.97,9923.446,9927.25,All different.,119,,

1442,0.97,9931.354,9938.662,I'm learning this all over again.,119,,
1443,0.97,9938.662,9939.629,Is a whole new world.,120,,
1444,0.97,9939.629,9941.064,Please call the roll.,121,,
1445,0.97,9941.064,9943.6,On the passage of counsel bill 1198 of the nine Pics you.,121,,
1446,0.97,9943.6,9954.144,"Yes, Councilmember Gonzalez.",122,,
1447,0.97,9958.815,9961.384,I think that they might of had to leave actually.,123,,
1448,0.97,9961.384,9962.185,Okay.,124,,
1449,0.97,9962.185,9963.386,Thank you.,124,,

1453,0.97,9986.443,9989.012,"It will be heard at full counsel on Monday, September 14th.",126,,
1454,0.97,9989.012,9990.313,That is the last item on today's agenda.,126,,
1455,0.97,9990.313,9993.683,I appreciate everyone staying with us so that we could get to this item.,126,,
1456,0.97,9993.683,9996.119,"If there is nothing more, for the good of the order, it is 12:17 P.M.",126,,
