260,0.97,1542.407,1558.456,In particular living in the meadow Brook area I'm sure you have first-hand experience with the lack of sidewalks or sidewalks being there and our ability to put in temporary measures to improve the pedestrian experience surrounding the high school.,64,,
261,0.97,1558.456,1565.564,I know in the past that used to be gravel driveways and there wasn't a clear distinction between if you are in the street or on the sidewalk.,64,,
262,0.97,1565.564,1575.473,Do you have any thoughts you like to share with the community about the meadow Brook area and the ability to have a safe pedestrian experience in that area?,64,,
263,0.97,1575.473,1584.883,"Yeah, so, we are not too far from the stay healthy streets that are a little bit farther North in the Lake City area.",65,,
264,0.97,1584.883,1603.301,"So what I have been noticing in our community is people kind of using the streets as if they are all see stay healthy streets, anyway we can expand Úthat or expand safe passages, whether that's sidewalks or markings or things to keep people safe who are walking around.",65,,
265,0.97,1603.301,1606.404,That's the direction I'd like us to move in.,65,,

275,0.97,1661.86,1664.996,So moving over to the program will be a new step in that direction.,68,,
276,0.97,1664.996,1672.771,"As far as pedestrian advisory board goes, I was really interested because I grew up in an area that lacked public transportation.",68,,
277,0.97,1672.771,1681.279,So moving to Seattle was a big decision for me was the first thing I looked up was the bus routes.,68,,
278,0.97,1681.279,1688.653,"How can I get around without a car, Seattle really has that on the pedestal and that was really important to me.",68,,
279,0.97,1688.653,1693.725,"To be able to add the perspective of not having a car at the same time having grown up without a car, is really important.",68,,
280,0.97,1693.725,1698.396,That is my contribution to the board.,68,,
281,0.97,1698.396,1699.197,"Thank you, Bianca.",69,,

285,0.97,1707.639,1716.181,I did when I was going to work.,71,,
286,0.97,1716.181,1716.481,Yes.,71,,
287,0.97,1716.481,1717.115,Fair enough.,72,,
288,0.97,1717.115,1719.15,"I also noticed you spent some time in Davis, California.",72,,
289,0.97,1719.15,1732.33,"Can you share any lessons you learned from Davis that has a very robust bicycle network, and how that can, what lessons you learned there and how that can be applied to Seattle?",72,,
290,0.97,1732.33,1738.837,"Yeah, so, I should start by saying I never rode my bike on campus.",73,,
291,0.97,1738.837,1739.637,I was way too scared.,73,,
292,0.97,1739.637,1741.239,The bikes circles are something that are new.,73,,
293,0.97,1741.239,1743.708,It's its own kind of beast.,73,,
294,0.97,1743.708,1754.452,"But I think that the way cars interact with the bikes was a huge, it was a huge thing that made a difference when you felt safe to ride your bike.",73,,
295,0.97,1754.452,1764.629,There is a difference between writing in the bike Lane and thinking you are safe and then having the mindset of the cars that way.,73,,
296,0.97,1764.629,1766.264,I think Seattle is making its way down there.,73,,
297,0.97,1766.264,1772.37,I think over in Fremont there is that kind of cut turn their the cars actually just instinctively know to yield.,73,,
298,0.97,1772.37,1779.444,That kind of mindset is super helpful to pedestrians and Bicyclists at the same time.,73,,
299,0.97,1779.444,1781.646,Thank you.,74,,
300,0.97,1781.646,1783.281,"Thanks, everybody.",74,,

308,0.97,1816.581,1818.216,Hi.,77,,
309,0.97,1818.216,1821.92,My name is Esti Mintz.,77,,
310,0.97,1821.92,1845.243,I have been living in Seattle and using public transportation and going around sidewalks where they exist for close to 40 years.,77,,

312,0.97,1859.057,1872.036,And I have done all of that using public transportation because I cannot drive.,77,,

317,0.97,1924.689,1926.724,We have quite a few.,77,,
318,0.97,1926.724,1934.832,"But everywhere in the city, that's what I'd like to promote.",77,,
319,0.97,1934.832,1936.234,That is my goal.,77,,

323,0.97,1959.624,1968.166,I wanted to wait until I heard from everybody and had just a question for either all of the members or any of the members who are interested in addressing this.,79,,
324,0.97,1968.166,2001.566,"Given that we have the Scooter legislation before us, later in this meeting, I'd be really interested to hear from the pedestrian advisory board members your advice to us for how we can make good policy that recognizes the needs of pedestrians to use those things we call sidewalks, things that are to walk on to minimize the interference from people using Úscooters to people walking on sidewalks.",79,,
325,0.97,2001.566,2016.114,"That is an area I have a great concern for the general pedestrian community, specifically, and then I also have a concern focused on pedestrians who are differently able to as well.",79,,
326,0.97,2016.114,2025.189,"I would love to hear from you, your wise Council on this topic we are about to take up . Thank you.",79,,
327,0.97,2025.189,2055.653,"If I can comment, yes, it is becoming a problem when you have sidewalks and walking areas being used for different purposes . Today you have the problem of restaurants and Cafcs extended, extending over sidewalks.",80,,
328,0.97,2055.653,2098.362,"Know we are going to add Scooters to that . and people that walk, it would be wonderful if there was an ability to designate certain areas for passing . You know, in a way, like what we have really, not everybody follows that we do try to indicate please go this way if you are using a bike and go this way if you're walking.",80,,
329,0.97,2098.362,2106.337,"It would be nice if there's an ability to separate, to have it separated somehow to make it easier.",80,,
330,0.97,2106.337,2116.981,Because I know I for example come across quite a few barriers.,80,,
331,0.97,2116.981,2128.826,"Actually crashed, crashing into me and stuff.",80,,
332,0.97,2128.826,2130.795,We have to try to separate those.,80,,
333,0.97,2130.795,2143.341,"Thank you, Esti, Bianca and Maria, if you have any comments.",81,,
334,0.97,2143.341,2160.258,"Just to add on to what Esti was saying, the more we can inform folks on guidelines, bikes and pedestrians have certain rules of the road, how they are going to get along, I would like to see really clear guidelines on how we can make this work, it's just another mode of transportation to add to the mix.",82,,
335,0.97,2160.258,2173.538,And especially any markings we can have indicating those guidelines and making it clear where they cannot go.,82,,
336,0.97,2173.538,2179.377,Thank you.,83,,
337,0.97,2179.377,2182.079,"Bianca, if you are still there do you want to address Scooters?",83,,
338,0.97,2182.213,2187.485,Nothing additional from me.,84,,
339,0.97,2187.485,2189.153,I think Esti summed it up well.,84,,
340,0.97,2189.153,2203.301,"I think about green Lake and I was on my bike the speak and weekend new not to go on their, not publishing but there is a level of self informing each other, I think as soon as we get that rolling that will be helpful.",84,,

342,0.97,2204.802,2209.473,Thank you everybody.,85,,

355,0.97,2255.152,2263.461,I wanted to extend my thanks to the work and time the folks are giving to this critical issue.,88,,
356,0.97,2263.461,2280.745,The pedestrian master plan is one of those transportation based plans that I always feel needs more attention both to the Policy-Based recommendations as well as the recommendations for capital improvements.,88,,
357,0.97,2280.745,2291.322,I really appreciate the willingness of folks to spend their time on this important part of our transportation network.,88,,

376,0.97,2350.047,2352.049,You are Unmute.,100,,
377,0.97,2352.049,2356.053,Council bill 119858.,100,,
378,0.97,2356.053,2413.411,"An ordinance relating to the financing of the West Seattle bridge immediate response project; creating a fund for depositing proceeds of taxable limited tax general obligation bonds in 2021; authorizing the loan of funds in the amount of $50,000,000 from the construction and inspections Fund and $20,000,000 from the Reet II capital projects fund to the 2021 Ltgo taxable bond fund for early phases of work on the bridge repair and replacement project; amending ordinance 126000, which adopted the 2020 budget, including the 2020-2025 capital improvement program (CIP); changing appropriations to the Seattle Department of transportation; and revising project allocations and spending plans for certain projects in the 2020-2025 CIP.",100,,
379,0.97,2413.411,2414.879,Thank you.,101,,
380,0.97,2414.879,2422.52,Obviously repairing and replacing the West Seattle bridge is a priority.,101,,
381,0.97,2422.52,2437.134,Declared an emergency and has received a lot of attention from everybody at City government working on transportation.,101,,
382,0.97,2437.134,2439.203,Councilmember Herbold has been a leader on this.,101,,
383,0.97,2439.203,2443.641,Did you want to make any introductory remarks about this item before we turn over to central staff and Sdot?,101,,
384,0.97,2443.641,2516.914,"I just want to say, I think the fact that we have really two really important actions, that the city has been driving for this week, both the Sdot hiring of the design and the Council's consideration of the financing legislation shows that the city is jointly, both the Council and executive is jointly considering the impacts of the bridge closer with urgency and moving forward Expediently on addressing not only the decisions about whether or not to repair, replace, but whether or not what is necessary to implement any of those decisions that will be made in the next month or two . I would, J█Ust one Poin in particular, I would love to be added as a sponsor to this legislation, if that is okay with you.",102,,
385,0.97,2516.914,2522.419,"And, I just wanted to jump right into the presentation",102,,
386,0.97,2522.419,2540.137,"Thank you Councilmember Herbold . We have Calvin from central staff with us here and we have Sam Zimbabwe and heather Marx,.",103,,
387,0.97,2540.137,2544.742,I think it's a fairly significant presentation so I will save my comments for later.,104,,
388,0.97,2544.742,2546.61,Director Sam Zimbabwe?,105,,
389,0.97,2546.61,2552.349,Thank you Council members and future Council members it seems like.,106,,
390,0.97,2552.349,2555.152,Thank you for having us here.,106,,
391,0.97,2555.152,2572.87,"We are excited about being here and talking about where we are, where we are going, and the importance of this Interfund loan to make sure we make progress in all the things we are doing around the West Seattle High-Rise bridge safety project.",106,,
392,0.97,2572.87,2580.377,"Is hard to believe it's been almost 5 months if I'm doing my math quickly, since we were last year.",106,,
393,0.97,2580.377,2607.404,", four months since we were last year talking to you at the full council rest assured there has been a lot of work that has gone on and continues to go on and we will talk a little bit about that, and then it will turn over to heather to talk about where we are going, since that April 20 briefing declared a city emergency, the first time we have done so for a piece of infrastructure.",106,,
394,0.97,2607.404,2615.713,Immobilized and began stabilization work for the Highbridge and are working to advance that on the low bridges well.,106,,
395,0.97,2615.713,2624.221,We are advancing all of her options on repair or replace of the bridge simultaneously to restore traffic as quickly as we are able.,106,,
396,0.97,2624.221,2636.233,"We have also made at the same time, knowing the impact it's having on communities on the both sides, we have made 175 individual traffic and Detour improvements to date.",106,,
397,0.97,2636.233,2640.304,We know there is still more work that needs to be done.,106,,
398,0.97,2640.304,2642.339,We have done a lot of work to engage the public.,106,,
399,0.97,2642.339,2652.983,And identify other external funding opportunities and partners we know will be needed to restore this critical connection.,106,,
400,0.97,2652.983,2655.519,There are two pieces we will talk about today.,106,,
401,0.97,2655.519,2679.877,The Interfund loan that was the subject of this and also automated enforcement that we think is going to be critically important to maintain the traffic mitigation we have been able to do so far and maintain the critical access of the low bridge for emergency vehicles for transit.,106,,
402,0.97,2679.877,2693.891,"Just a reminder, the West Seattle bridge, we closed on March 23, due to rapid growth in cracking along the center section of the bridge.",106,,
403,0.97,2693.891,2698.996,"We have this image of how much those cracks grew in the three weeks, 2.5 weeks prior to the closure.",106,,
404,0.97,2698.996,2705.102,"After we closed the bridge crack continued, but slowed.",106,,
405,0.97,2705.102,2710.974,"And throughout this process, safety has been our top priority.",106,,
406,0.97,2710.974,2724.588,"In making the difficult decision to close the bridge, thinking about how we manage Mitigations and manage the various access and making sure our crews and Contactors are safe as well.",106,,
407,0.97,2724.588,2734.731,"When we closed the bridge on March 23, it was unplanned, so we hadn't done any of the budget things you would normally do for project we were planning ahead.",106,,
408,0.97,2734.731,2748.545,Some of the work we are doing with this Interfund loan now is getting things back into sort of a more planned state and making sure we have all of the resources in place necessary to keep making the progress we have made.,106,,
409,0.97,2748.545,2763.36,"What has changed since in the last few months, we have been outfitted both the Highbridge and low bridge with intelligent monitoring systems that are monitoring 4/7 to give us advanced warning of a potential medical failure.",106,,
410,0.97,2763.36,2778.642,"It also we can learn things as we do actions like raising the work platforms up, we can see how the bridge response and understand where there is still strength and where repairs might be needed.",106,,
411,0.97,2778.642,2781.678,And what the feasibility and cost of those repairs are.,106,,
412,0.97,2781.678,2797.494,"Are Nondestructive evaluation, using technological means to understand of the interior of the bridge works has found substantial strength in the Post-Tensioning steel strands embedded within the concrete.",106,,
413,0.97,2797.494,2807.671,That is very good news in terms of both the likelihood of a catastrophic failure and also what our options are for repair and replacement as well.,106,,
414,0.97,2807.671,2815.112,And then the technical advisory panel we convened confirmed our initial determination that repair is possible.,106,,
415,0.97,2815.112,2819.616,Is feasible.,106,,
416,0.97,2819.616,2822.319,We have not yet made the determination of whether that repair is advisable.,106,,
417,0.97,2822.319,2839.736,"That is really the decision we are in now we will talk more about That., about what the right Pathway forward is and how we best, the best stewardship of the asset and the need for the committee to get back and forth between West Seattle and the rest of the region.",106,,
418,0.97,2839.736,2852.149,How we best make progress and take the next steps.,106,,
419,0.97,2852.149,2855.152,There are three ongoing categories of work we will talk about on the bridge.,106,,
420,0.97,2855.152,2859.523,"The bridge structure itself on the ground, all the things we are doing around the bridge closure in the mitigation of traffic.",106,,
421,0.97,2859.523,2865.362,"And then in the community, or we are doing to engage and communicate and hear feedback from the broader community about what and how we are doing this.",106,,
422,0.97,2865.362,2876.273,With that I will turn over to heather who is coordinating all of these efforts for the Department.,106,,
423,0.97,2876.273,2886.683,"I am heather Marx, the director of downtown mobility for Sdot as well is the program director for the West Seattle bridge safety program.",107,,
424,0.97,2886.683,2892.189,Am very pleased to be here today and thank you for having us.,107,,
425,0.97,2892.189,2904.968,"So, as Sam mentioned, we declare the West Seattle bridge and emergency and expect to support funding permitting and materials acquisition . We have developed an emergency contingency plan in case the worst happens.",107,,
426,0.97,2904.968,2909.106,With the city and other interagency partners.,107,,
427,0.97,2909.106,2920.617,We have also installed 76 monitoring devices on both the Highbridge and the low bridge so we can monitor 24/7 what is happening with the structural health of the bridge.,107,,
428,0.97,2920.617,2930.961,We have created a technical advisory panel full of Geotechnical and structural engineers to help inform and guide the city's recommendations.,107,,
429,0.97,2930.961,2933.83,We have started ridge stabilization work.,107,,
430,0.97,2933.83,2944.141,"If you've had a chance to go over the low bridge on your bicycle of course, and gaze up, you can see the platforms they are using to do the stabilization.",107,,
431,0.97,2944.141,2950.614,And we have finished the search for the team to design the eventual replacement . We announced that yesterday.,107,,
432,0.97,2950.614,2957.154,Is Hntb.,107,,
433,0.97,2957.154,2959.623,Here are some pictures of the stabilization platforms you can see.,107,,
434,0.97,2959.623,2966.963,They are at work and they are able to move back and forth across the length of the Bidge.,107,,
435,0.97,2966.963,2980.477,They are installing three layers of carbon reinforced fiber polymer . It is sort of like an ace bandage or a Band- aid.,107,,
436,0.97,2980.477,2983.18,"To help, it's stiffer, a lot.",107,,
437,0.97,2983.18,2995.459,To help support the bridge and we are also installing additional external post tensioning.,107,,
438,0.97,2995.459,3001.098,These are activities intended to prevent the catastrophic failure of the bridge which we consider to be of paramount importance.,107,,
439,0.97,3001.098,3009.606,Next slide.,107,,
440,0.97,3009.606,3010.841,We are also monitoring the low bridge.,107,,
441,0.97,3010.841,3015.479,The low bridge is a critical bridge in our infrastructure in normal times and now it is more essential than ever has been.,107,,
442,0.97,3015.479,3020.517,Recent updates and Federal regulations require a structural and operational response to the bridge.,107,,
443,0.97,3020.517,3035.198,The bridge is now equipped with complete structural health monitoring instrumentation and we are in the process of selecting a designer contractor to do the strengthening work required.,107,,
444,0.97,3035.198,3044.508,"Operationally, until we can get the strengthening work done, we have lowered the speed limit and we have added weight restrictions for the very largest trucks allowed on city streets.",107,,
445,0.97,3044.508,3047.544,"Next slide, please.",107,,
446,0.97,3047.544,3055.719,We have this little graphic that shows the direction we will go if we select repair or replacement.,107,,
447,0.97,3055.719,3060.957,We expect to have that decision made this fall.,107,,
448,0.97,3060.957,3067.664,"And if we go with the repair route, it is with the intention of replacing the bridge as well.",107,,
449,0.97,3067.664,3071.935,It would just take a longer time to do a careful job of that.,107,,
450,0.97,3071.935,3085.148,"We would expect that in roughly 2032 we would have a replaced bridge, sorry, we would start on the replaced bridge that would give us a 75 year life.",107,,
451,0.97,3085.148,3095.092,"If we Pivot directly to replacement, we could have an open repair to replace bridge by 2024 to 2026.",107,,
452,0.97,3095.092,3099.563,Next slide please.,107,,
453,0.97,3099.563,3115.212,"So, in order to achieve that, to take that decision whether to repair or replace, we are engaging with our engineering consultants, the technical advisory panel and the community task force in a Cost- benefit analysis.",107,,
454,0.97,3115.212,3127.09,What that does is weighs the pros and cons of the multiple options to help us arrive at a decision whether to repair or replace the West Seattle Highbridge.,107,,
455,0.97,3127.09,3131.194,"However it's important to note that this is a tool, it is not a decision-making machine.",107,,
456,0.97,3131.194,3143.24,"And so, it is going to evaluate those pros and Cons, but ultimately Sdot is going to develop a recommendation and present it to the Mayor.",107,,
457,0.97,3143.24,3150.747,"Based not only on the cost benefit analysis, but on the full range of information that comes to us.",107,,
458,0.97,3150.747,3154.818,It also is not going to produce a precise cost estimate.,107,,
459,0.97,3154.818,3162.926,This is a very frustrating thing not only for you and the public but also for us.,107,,
460,0.97,3162.926,3175.739,In order to get a precise cost estimate we need to have a much more significant level of design than the cost benefit analysis is going to provide for us.,107,,
461,0.97,3175.739,3180.043,"However, the cost benefit analysis does consider a range of rough order of magnitude costs.",107,,
462,0.97,3180.043,3189.486,"And, it is so critical it has given a factor to be layered upon the attributes that we are going to discuss here in the next couple of slides.",107,,
463,0.97,3189.486,3194.491,Councilmember Herbold has a question.,108,,
464,0.97,3194.491,3194.791,Go ahead.,108,,
465,0.97,3194.791,3213.343,"I am sorry, I will have a question on the cost benefit analysis, but I'd like to go back to both the stabilization on the West Seattle bridge and the strengthening work on the lower level bridge.",109,,
466,0.97,3213.343,3223.019,"If you could refresh my memory, what is the Timeline for completing the stabilization?",109,,
467,0.97,3223.019,3223.887,On the Highbridge?,109,,
468,0.97,3223.887,3238.101,"And as it relates to low bridge, strengthening, you have an estimate of when it will happen and can you remind me whether or not it is expected to involve closures?",109,,
469,0.97,3238.101,3245.208,So the stabilization of the Highbridge is going to continue through the fall and early winter.,110,,
470,0.97,3245.208,3248.244,Every action that they take is providing stabilization pretty.,110,,
471,0.97,3248.244,3254.951,So every moment of work we do on the Highbridge is continuing to shore it up.,110,,
472,0.97,3254.951,3265.328,"As far as the low bridge goes, that is going to be probably a two-year project, but we are engaged right now selecting the designer contractor for that strengthening work.",110,,
473,0.97,3265.328,3275.105,So that is also on a very fast track because of the Criticality of the lower bridge especially in our current environment.,110,,
474,0.97,3275.105,3285.382,There may be some short-term closures of the low bridge . But we don't expect any long-term closures of the low bridge for the strengthening work that needs to be done.,110,,
475,0.97,3285.382,3288.485,Obviously that is a guess at this point.,110,,
476,0.97,3288.485,3291.087,Don't have a contractor on board nor a design.,110,,
477,0.97,3291.087,3293.556,"So, more will come there.",110,,
478,0.97,3293.556,3307.17,Everybody at Sdot and hence everybody is going to be involved in the design and building process of that low bridge strengthening understands just how important the low bridge is to the system.,110,,
479,0.97,3307.17,3312.409,"And so, we will minimize any unnecessary closures.",110,,
480,0.97,3312.409,3313.209,Thank you.,111,,
481,0.97,3313.209,3315.812,"Next slide, please.",112,,
482,0.97,3315.812,3322.619,So the Slideshows the process we are going through with the cost benefit analysis.,112,,
483,0.97,3322.619,3330.093,The phase 1 is over so we have identified the attributes.,112,,
484,0.97,3330.093,3334.464,We have gained to the input from the technical advisory panel as well as the community task force about the attributes.,112,,
485,0.97,3334.464,3341.037,And we also determined the most important criteria so we can begin the analysis.,112,,
486,0.97,3341.037,3350.013,"And we did that, I will talk a little more about this through a weighting process.",112,,
487,0.97,3350.013,3354.651,Phase 2 is ongoing right now.,112,,
488,0.97,3354.651,3362.425,This is going to be applying the attributes to the 10% design we need to create for all the options.,112,,
489,0.97,3362.425,3371.334,"It is going to score those attributes, it's going to determine the rough order of magnitude costs I discussed.",112,,
490,0.97,3371.334,3380.677,It's going to quantify the results and then present a recommendation which we will share with both the technical advisory panel and the community task force.,112,,
491,0.97,3380.677,3402.098,"In early to mid October we should have all of that quantified and Sdot should be able to present only the cost benefit analysis but also our ultimate recommendation to the Mayor about the we want to pursue, repair and then replace or move directly to replacement.",112,,
492,0.97,3402.098,3406.469,"Next slide, please.",112,,
493,0.97,3406.469,3412.909,"So, on the ground, we have already made 175 traffic improvements.",112,,
494,0.97,3412.909,3415.812,I know that's a really specific number but I can tell you we have a list.,112,,
495,0.97,3415.812,3427.824,"We have installed real-time cameras, we have connected signals at intersections into the main system so that we can adjust signal timing remotely.",112,,
496,0.97,3427.824,3439.002,"We are displaying travel times, our dynamic message signs, we have installed a temporary traffic signal at Southwest Holden.",112,,
497,0.97,3439.002,3445.842,We have Repaved the five way intersection which is the photo you are seeing.,112,,
498,0.97,3445.842,3461.524,We have Repaved Roxbury between 16th and 18th in a joint project with King County roads and we pull that off as a cord needed project really quickly and I want to thank Councilmember Herbold for her help making that happen.,112,,
499,0.97,3461.524,3466.362,We have also improved the intersection at 16th and Holden with signal and Channelization improvements.,112,,
500,0.97,3466.362,3471.267,Long anticipated by the community.,112,,
501,0.97,3471.267,3473.469,Have also added speed signs and removed tree obstructions on sylvan way.,112,,
502,0.97,3473.469,3479.843,That turned out to be a favorite background so we have done some things to make it safer.,112,,
503,0.97,3479.843,3486.483,Have also launched Reconnect West Seattle table talk about a little more in this presentation.,112,,
504,0.97,3486.483,3486.95,Next please.,112,,
505,0.97,3486.95,3489.085,Councilmember Herbold?,112,,
506,0.97,3489.085,3491.588,Thank you.,113,,
507,0.97,3491.588,3544.407,"I just wanted to in addition to all this work you are doing, to make the Detour routes work smoothly for the community, I want to give a special thank you despite the fact it wasn't in any of the neighborhood focused surveys, you included Sullivan way sylvan way and that shows your willingness to be flexible and respond to feedback from the community about what they are seeing on the ground rather than just sticking to what might be the preconceived notions of where the traffic impacts are the greatest in the community that is most impacted by those impacts.",113,,
508,0.97,3544.407,3558.221,"So really, again, I appreciate your willingness to make these improvements on sylvan way despite the neighborhood not being called out within the surveys.",113,,
509,0.97,3558.221,3558.821,Absolutely.,114,,
510,0.97,3558.821,3559.455,You are very welcome.,114,,
511,0.97,3559.455,3571.034,"And I just want to note the because this is an emergency situation and there was, nobody planned any of this, we were having to be, it is necessary for us to be responsive to what communities are seeing.",114,,
512,0.97,3571.034,3574.27,That is a key goal of our program.,114,,
513,0.97,3574.27,3577.073,"So, our vision for Reconnect West Seattle --",114,,
514,0.97,3577.073,3580.076,"Excuse me, Council President Gonzalez.",115,,
515,0.97,3580.076,3586.449,In a zoom world is easy for us to just plow through.,116,,
516,0.97,3586.449,3588.051,I appreciate that.,116,,
517,0.97,3588.051,3589.085,That's okay.,116,,
518,0.97,3589.085,3592.288,No need to apologize.,116,,
519,0.97,3592.288,3613.676,"On the 175 traffic improvements, honestly the slide doesn't include all 175, I did want to take the opportunity to acknowledge that the impacts of the West Seattle bridge closure obviously has impacts regionally.",116,,
520,0.97,3613.676,3621.718,"But also in other parts of the city in the Southwest, Southeast area.",116,,
521,0.97,3621.718,3650.013,"I feel Remiss in not lifting that up and just giving you an opportunity to really quickly share with us a couple of thoughts around how you all are addressing traffic impacts in improvement needs as a result of the West Seattle bridge in neighborhoods like Georgetown, and Southpark.",116,,
522,0.97,3650.013,3661.758,"This is very focused on that adjacent area, immediately and geographically adjacent areas to where the low and Highbridge are at.",116,,
523,0.97,3661.758,3675.304,Acknowledge and recognize their other parts of the city that are experiencing traffic impacts as a result of the detours and diversions and trying to figure out how to get around and into and out of West Seattle.,116,,
524,0.97,3675.304,3677.974,You can share with us a little bit more.,116,,
525,0.97,3677.974,3680.943,Absolutely.,117,,
526,0.97,3680.943,3683.546,Thank you very much for bringing that up.,117,,
527,0.97,3683.546,3705.501,"Making sure we are attending to and caring for the needs of the communities most impacted by the closure of the West Seattle bridge, particularly by additional Detour traffic, is something that is of the utmost importance.",117,,
528,0.97,3705.501,3708.571,Later in the presentation I'm going to go into that more deeply.,117,,
529,0.97,3708.571,3713.676,Should you have additional questions I'm happy to respond to that.,117,,
530,0.97,3713.676,3716.512,I appreciate that.,118,,
531,0.97,3716.512,3717.613,"Next slide, please.",119,,
532,0.97,3717.613,3722.418,Here are some words about that in fact.,120,,
533,0.97,3722.418,3743.339,We want to make sure that during this time of West Seattle bridge closure that we are supporting similar levels of travel across the Duwamish valley as those we saw before the High-Rise bridge closed.,120,,
534,0.97,3743.339,3748.01,This is a big challenge for us because we used to have 21 lanes across the Duwamish Valley and now we have 12.,120,,
535,0.97,3748.01,3763.259,Clearly to support that same level of transportation with fewer lanes means we are going to have to explore options beyond a single occupant vehicle.,120,,
536,0.97,3763.259,3777.273,"We also, you'll note, have a goal of reducing the environmental injustices that impact communities in the Duwamish Valley, Southpark and Georgetown particularly Southpark but Georgetown as well play host to significantly higher levels of air pollution than other parts of the city.",120,,
537,0.97,3777.273,3779.675,As well as proximity to a Superfund site.,120,,
538,0.97,3779.675,3793.89,"We are well aware that not only is additional traffic to the neighborhoods a nuisance, but it's also creating additional air pollution in those areas that can ill afford it.",120,,
539,0.97,3793.89,3809.705,"Through a community led process we have identified the challenges and Prioritized solutions that are going to help increase options for transit Ridership, bike and pedestrian trips for those who are able, of course.",120,,
540,0.97,3809.705,3811.474,And safety on our streets and sidewalks.,120,,
541,0.97,3811.474,3816.679,"Next slide, please ..",120,,
542,0.97,3816.679,3818.514,. There are three parts of Reconnect West Seattle.,120,,
543,0.97,3818.514,3831.894,"The first are the neighborhood mitigation strategies and those are the ones that are particularly focused on the neighborhoods of the Southern part of West Seattle including Roxhill, South Delridge, Riverview and Highland park.",120,,
544,0.97,3831.894,3838.201,"As well as Southpark, Georgetown and Sodo.",120,,
545,0.97,3838.201,3855.818,We have created specific neighborhood traffic mitigation plans for those neighborhoods that include things like traffic calming and Wayfinding and improvements to the Streetscape that are going to help minimize the impact of those Detour routes.,120,,
546,0.97,3855.818,3874.971,We've created some activity plans for bicycles and we have a broader mobility action plan that Reimagines and Reorients transportation in West Seattle across the Duwamish valley.,120,,
547,0.97,3874.971,3880.243,I am pretty proud of the level of input we received to our surveys.,120,,
548,0.97,3880.243,3884.28,It is pretty impressive.,120,,
549,0.97,3884.28,3890.419,"For the mobility action plan surveys we had more than 15,000 responses which is about 22% of registered voters.",120,,
550,0.97,3890.419,3893.189,In that area.,120,,
551,0.97,3893.189,3899.295,We also received more than 1600 neighborhood Prioritization ballots.,120,,
552,0.97,3899.295,3915.578,We went to some particular lengths with ardor partners at the Department neighborhoods for in language and in person virtual outreach through their community liaisons to Communitie that are a little bit more challenging to reach.,120,,
553,0.97,3915.578,3936.499,We also had a significant presence on ethnic media and made sure that all of our materials were translated of course and available in all the languages that are the most prevalent in the neighborhoods that are included in that neighborhood traffic mitigation.,120,,
554,0.97,3936.499,3938.034,A portion of our program.,120,,
555,0.97,3938.034,3940.536,Next slide.,120,,
556,0.97,3940.536,3950.713,"So the big themes are, from the mobility action plan are to do significant mode shift.",120,,
557,0.97,3950.713,3952.448,From where we were in 2019.,120,,
558,0.97,3952.448,3967.563,"All those confirmed social distancing results in fewer trips today than in 2019 which is pretty evident if you're out on the streets, the only mode though that has maintained its safe level is Bicycling.",120,,
559,0.97,3967.563,3976.539,The surveys also indicate we with additional travel options and investments.,120,,
560,0.97,3976.539,3994.39,"And we also learned that when social distancing ends, may that be soon in our days, respondents say they plan to drive less than before and take more trips on the water taxi, bicycles than they did in 2019.",120,,
561,0.97,3994.39,4019.415,"From the neighborhood ballots, as I mentioned we focus on Highland Park, Axel, Southpark, Georgetown, we found that the items folks most earners--traffic, accessibility, speeding, and of course in Vermont impacts on pollution.",120,,
562,0.97,4019.415,4028.557,"The top projects in these three categories, the top priority projects, some are in progress right now.",120,,
563,0.97,4028.791,4030.326,Some can be done before the end of 2020.,120,,
564,0.97,4030.326,4044.94,And some of those projects are going to be completed in 2021 after further refinement and conversation with those community's that I mentioned.,120,,
565,0.97,4044.94,4045.341,Next slide.,120,,
566,0.97,4045.341,4048.944,Meanwhile I have been spending a lot of time with a lot of Stakeholder groups.,120,,
567,0.97,4048.944,4054.316,Councilmember Herbold.,121,,
568,0.97,4054.316,4054.984,"Hi, Councilmember.",122,,
569,0.97,4054.984,4067.063,"On that last slide, I just wanted to recognize that I really appreciate the focus using an equity focus to focus on those particular neighborhoods.",123,,
570,0.97,4067.063,4115.778,", also the reality is these are also the neighborhoods that are experiencing the highest traffic volumes, and that is occurring in Southpark, South Delridge so I think it's important to recognize not just equity focus based on lack of historical investment in structuring those community's, but also the significant Detour impact in those communities so the investments are really important because we are also thinking forward to the fact that a replacement or fixed to the bridge that results in traffic diversions in Southern communities could have this effect currently.",123,,
571,0.97,4115.778,4142.438,"I really appreciate the conceptually, that Sdot, through this approaches connecting sort of the historical inequities around investment in these communities to the current impacts to the community's to what might be future greater impacts to these communities in using this particular approach for investments.",123,,
572,0.97,4142.438,4142.938,Just another thanks.,123,,
573,0.97,4142.938,4162.358,"Thank you very much Councilmember Herbold . one of the things that is going to allow us to continue to make those investments both for current conditions and future conditions and to make it up for past inequities is exactly the funding you're talking about, that is the subject of the legislation today.",124,,
574,0.97,4162.358,4171.734,"So as I mentioned, I have been meeting with lots of Stakeholder groups and we created a 40 person community task force to inform and guide the city's response to the bridge closure.",124,,
575,0.97,4171.734,4177.84,"We are communicating all the time to our Website, Blog, Email lists and media.",124,,
576,0.97,4177.84,4185.347,"If you are interested in signing up for those updates, please go to the Website and sign up.",124,,
577,0.97,4185.347,4186.749,News8 subscribe now button.,124,,
578,0.97,4186.749,4192.388,We also started out our low bridge access really limited.,124,,
579,0.97,4192.388,4197.193,"We limited the low bridge to transit, freight and emergency vehicles.",124,,
580,0.97,4197.193,4210.706,"That over time we have had, we've been able to collect enough data to identify that there are, there is additional capacity on the low bridge.",124,,
581,0.97,4210.706,4218.981,So we have extended that access to some very specific community Maritime workers.,124,,
582,0.97,4218.981,4224.119,Some essential Vanpools run by King County Metro transit.,124,,
583,0.97,4224.119,4231.827,Shuttles run by large employers and also to support business access for West Seattle.,124,,
584,0.97,4231.827,4233.696,Businesses in both the junction and throughout West Seattle.,124,,
585,0.97,4233.696,4236.231,"Next slide, please.",124,,
586,0.97,4236.231,4238.534,Councilmember Herbold.,125,,
587,0.97,4238.534,4239.335,Thank you.,126,,
588,0.97,4239.335,4265.761,"On the business Shuttles I appreciate that Sdot has approved 22 business Shuttles for number of businesses, I learned last week, though that those Shuttles for the most part art under operations because many of the businesses, they are large businesses, that we have awarded the ability to use Shuttles to are still doing stay at work.",126,,
589,0.97,4265.761,4269.231,So they are not fighting it necessary to operate those Shuttles.,126,,
590,0.97,4269.231,4284.847,"And I know there are requests from for instance the West Seattle Chamber to fill some of those for lack of a better word, heather think you referred to the maybe as slots.",126,,
591,0.97,4284.847,4299.695,"And I'm just wondering, what can we do to meet the need that exists now while saving capacity for the need that may not exist now but we are reserving for businesses are going to need it later?",126,,
592,0.97,4299.695,4309.805,"Yeah, that is a good question and we are actively engaged in solving that right now.",127,,
593,0.97,4309.805,4324.086,We are on a little bit of a Razors edge because on the one hand if there's any capacity we want to make sure we are able to provide it to those small businesses the need to have easy access back and forth across the bridge to go to COSTCO or whatever they need to support their businesses.,127,,
594,0.97,4324.086,4342.137,"On the other hand when we do get back to a situation where employers are going to be wishing for the employees to come back into the office, we are going to need to have that available too.",127,,
595,0.97,4342.137,4350.045,"So, creating a situation where we are going to say here are some passes, now we need them back, it doesn't sound like a lot of fun.",127,,
596,0.97,4350.045,4359.221,We are trying to figure out how to make that happen in a way that is going to feel equitable and that is also going to support transportation goals.,127,,
597,0.97,4359.221,4360.422,I've got my eyes on it.,127,,
598,0.97,4360.422,4361.023,Thank you.,127,,
599,0.97,4361.023,4362.224,Thank you.,128,,
600,0.97,4362.224,4365.327,"Next slide, please.",129,,
601,0.97,4365.327,4368.564,Important to the low bridge is automated enforcement.,129,,
602,0.97,4368.564,4377.873,As I mentioned we are trying to maintain the level of traffic on the low bridge that allows emergency vehicles to make it back and forth.,129,,
603,0.97,4377.873,4384.179,I think we can probably all agree in a pandemic having emergency access across the bridge is pretty important.,129,,
604,0.97,4384.179,4399.395,So right now we have Seattle police Department traffic officers enforcing the exclusion of individual cars from going across the low bridge.,129,,
605,0.97,4399.395,4405.701,They only are in place in the morning Pekin afternoon peak.,129,,
606,0.97,4405.701,4409.371,It's not a sustainable situation.,129,,
607,0.97,4409.371,4425.421,We were fortunate last legislative session to have the revised code of Washington updated to include automated enforcement for this kind of purpose.,129,,
608,0.97,4425.421,4429.892,The low bridge is within that area.,129,,
609,0.97,4429.892,4432.294,We are going to need to update the Seattle,129,,
610,0.97,4432.294,4435.33,Code with those recent changes.,130,,
611,0.97,4435.33,4441.436,If you haven't already you'll receive legislation on the topic.,130,,
612,0.97,4441.436,4446.175,"The new state law allows the use of automated enforcement for transit lanes, locking the box and traveling in restricted lanes.",130,,
613,0.97,4446.175,4462.558,"You may recall that about this time last year I was probably briefing you on the situation with congestion downtown, less of a problem right now.",130,,
614,0.97,4462.558,4465.027,Fortunately this legislation helps us where we need it the most.,130,,
615,0.97,4465.027,4472.534,Cameras are permitted in greater downtown including the Spokane Street low bridge.,130,,
616,0.97,4472.534,4479.775,There are existing privacy safeguards and publishing notice requirements in the ordinance will be transmitted once it's finalized.,130,,
617,0.97,4479.775,4483.278,Next slide.,130,,
618,0.97,4483.278,4491.186,"So, we hope to have that pilot project started this fall.",130,,
619,0.97,4491.186,4492.054,Councilmember Herbold.,131,,
620,0.97,4492.054,4506.268,I just wanted to give a shout out to Joseph Gibbons for his work in Olympia session after session after session to get this legislation passed.,132,,
621,0.97,4506.268,4533.295,"Obviously we have a need to protect her transit lanes and our pedestrians from Work- related to Blackbox, that Predated the failure of the bridge, I'm just so happy that even in the 11th hour, deliberations around this legislation, there were efforts to make it geographically focused.",132,,
622,0.97,4533.295,4548.11,"In downtown Seattle, and representative Givens made sure that West Seattle and bus lanes were covered in legislation.",132,,
623,0.97,4548.11,4550.746,Really pressing it for the issues we are dealing with now.,132,,
624,0.97,4550.879,4558.854,"We are all very, very grateful to the work that all of our elected officials did to make that happen.",133,,
625,0.97,4558.854,4564.96,It is really going to make things a lot easier.,133,,
626,0.97,4564.96,4570.365,The camera automated enforcement on that low bridge are going to be similar to a red light and school enforcement.,133,,
627,0.97,4570.365,4576.738,The registered vehicle owner will receive a morning warning with no penalty through the end of 2020.,133,,
628,0.97,4576.738,4583.078,In January they will start issuing tickets with the $75 maximum fine.,133,,
629,0.97,4583.078,4588.083,It requires local legislation so you will be seeing that shortly.,133,,
630,0.97,4588.083,4595.591,We are expecting to roll out additional locations in the city in 2021.,133,,
631,0.97,4595.591,4603.298,Right now we are most focused on the low bridge.,133,,
632,0.97,4603.298,4607.402,Councilmember Herbold.,134,,
633,0.97,4607.402,4623.485,"Once the automated cameras are operating, is there any likelihood that Sdot will go back to review the access policies of the lower-level bridge?",135,,
634,0.97,4623.485,4634.029,"Yeah, one of the things the automated enforcement is going to do is allow us to create a more finely grained access policy for the low bridge.",136,,
635,0.97,4634.029,4638.3,Right now we have to sort of assume that every vehicle is going to show up at the same time.,136,,
636,0.97,4638.3,4643.038,"And we know that is not true, in the real world, but how to control that is one of our problems.",136,,
637,0.97,4643.038,4658.92,With automated enforcement it makes it a lot more accessible to know that we are going to have certain kinds of vehicles that are going to be using the bridge at certain hours of the day so we can maybe open up additional access in those times that have lower volumes.,136,,
638,0.97,4658.92,4663.458,Absolutely.,136,,
639,0.97,4663.458,4663.692,Okay.,136,,
640,0.97,4663.692,4667.763,Are we ready to talk about the Interfund loan.,136,,
641,0.97,4667.763,4675.671,Because it's an emergency we could not follow the typical and traditional planning process and budgeting cycle.,136,,
642,0.97,4675.671,4683.945,"Since the beginning, since we closed the bridge have been encouraging Non-Budgeted costs in existing programs.",136,,
643,0.97,4683.945,4696.391,Have been keeping track of those in a granular way so we can ashore to a it those to the right things as we get a new program set up.,136,,
644,0.97,4696.391,4704.499,The programs that have been bearing those costs are mostly bridge Rehab and her placement.,136,,
645,0.97,4704.499,4725.62,"To ensure we are Resourced to do what is best not only for West Seattle but also for the Duwamish Valley, particularly in the realm of traffic, improvements, as well as Leveraging all possible Federal, state and local sources of money to find repairs and replacements on the West Seattle bridge.",136,,
646,0.97,4725.62,4727.622,We need to have that city in the game.,136,,
647,0.97,4727.622,4731.827,In the meantime we do have immediate need for additional revenue because there are things we need to do right now.,136,,
648,0.97,4731.827,4742.104,The $70 million Interfund loan is going to provide that needed cash flow to cover the expenses in 2020 and the first quarter of 2021.,136,,
649,0.97,4742.104,4748.81,Currently the cap only goes through 2021 because that is as far ahead as we can look at this moment.,136,,
650,0.97,4748.81,4757.519,Very soon we are going to have that repair or replacement decision made that's going to allow us to forecast costs out to the end of the program.,136,,
651,0.97,4757.519,4758.954,We just don't know.,136,,
652,0.97,4758.954,4764.359,I want to assure you this is uncomfortable for all of us.,136,,
653,0.97,4764.359,4770.065,Sdot is a department made of engineers and planners.,136,,
654,0.97,4770.065,4780.876,So having to keep moving forward when we are blind to what the end of the road looks like is uncomfortable for us as will ensure for you.,136,,
655,0.97,4780.876,4788.383,We are going to refine those project costs for the cop repair or replace decision.,136,,
656,0.97,4788.383,4799.795,One of the things that might suit you is we have hired the design consultant that's going to help us move through the repair process.,136,,
657,0.97,4799.795,4807.002,We are Well-Positioned to have some estimates very shortly after we make the decision of preparing.,136,,
658,0.97,4807.002,4810.105,Next slide.,136,,
659,0.97,4810.105,4817.879,So we estimate spending between 160-225 over this year and next year.,136,,
660,0.97,4817.879,4821.516,There is a lot of uncertainty.,136,,
661,0.97,4821.516,4833.695,"The full program, depending on Úwhat we end up doing could Cos significantly more than 225 million it just depends on the repair or replacement decision.",136,,
662,0.97,4833.695,4853.014,The Interfund loan I been talking about is backed by a bond sale and would be barred from the city's construction and inspections fun and Reet II and would be repaid by Sdot . We were just a little too late to do the bond sale in 2020.,136,,
663,0.97,4853.014,4864.559,"In addition to paying off that Interfund loan, the bond sale and also support $30 million worth of spending on the project in 2021.",136,,
664,0.97,4864.559,4876.171,And any needed spending above that would be supported by a separate loan established in early 21 to be repaid by a 2022 bond sale.,136,,
665,0.97,4876.171,4877.572,I hope you are following that.,136,,
666,0.97,4877.572,4878.807,I'm not sure I am.,136,,
667,0.97,4878.807,4887.082,"Yes, chair Pedersen.",136,,
668,0.97,4887.082,4895.39,I am comfortable with this transaction because the amount is only $70 million.,137,,
669,0.97,4895.39,4905.0,"To me, Reet II is not the most reliable sources in terms of its steadiness.",137,,
670,0.97,4905.0,4924.819,"But this is a manageable amount . When you talk about the spending range going up to, $160 million up to $225 million, we are going to want to talk about the repayment sources and get really deep into the cost.",137,,
671,0.97,4924.819,4933.228,As I understand the $70 million is broken into two pieces for two different purposes?,137,,
672,0.97,4933.228,4934.829,Could you explain that again?,137,,
673,0.97,4934.829,4937.499,Yeah.,138,,
674,0.97,4937.499,4938.533,Let me put my notes.,138,,
675,0.97,4938.533,4940.935,I don't have that off top of my head.,138,,
676,0.97,4940.935,4942.537,For which I am sorry.,138,,
677,0.97,4942.537,4948.243,It is actually divided into several pieces.,138,,
678,0.97,4948.243,4961.456,The whole amount is going to be spent on temporary shoring or emergency control Demo depending on where we need to go with that.,138,,
679,0.97,4961.456,4966.962,"Of course the hybrid stabilization work we are doing right now, that is a key thing to remember, some of this we are already doing.",138,,
680,0.97,4966.962,4971.433,These are expenditures we have made.,138,,
681,0.97,4971.433,4976.971,"The low bridge repairs and improvements I spoke of earlier in the presentation, communications with community.",138,,
682,0.97,4976.971,4985.447,Making sure that we are funding our technical advisory panel.,138,,
683,0.97,4985.447,5001.296,"Also the planning and design contract for replacing the bridge and the Reconnect West Seattle planning and implementation, those are the traffic improvements we are making to make it a little easier on the communities that are bearing the brunt of those detours.",138,,
684,0.97,5001.296,5007.802,And of course the bread monitoring testing and maintenance of other bridges in that West Seattle bridge quarter.,138,,
685,0.97,5007.802,5008.603,Thank you.,139,,
686,0.97,5008.603,5016.911,You're welcome.,140,,
687,0.97,5016.911,5021.583,Next slide please.,140,,
688,0.97,5021.583,5022.016,What you know.,140,,
689,0.97,5022.016,5025.82,Here's an answer to the question?,140,,
690,0.97,5025.82,5029.324,I already said all those things so we will move on to the next slide.,140,,
691,0.97,5029.324,5045.306,"So, one of the things I want to make clear is that Sdot is not anticipating that the city of Seattle is going to be expected to bear the entire cost of this project, whether it's repair or replacement.",140,,
692,0.97,5045.306,5060.955,We are in active conversations with her Federal partners including the delegation and local division and build America . We are of course speaking with offensive the state and that the state delegation as Úwell as the Washington State Department of transportation.,140,,
693,0.97,5060.955,5068.53,We have already been successful with almost $7 million of grants for the Puget sound region Council.,140,,
694,0.97,5068.53,5075.37,The port Northwest Seaport alliance benefit greatly from a repaired or replaced structure.,140,,
695,0.97,5075.37,5085.38,Sound transit we are in conversation that it's if it turns out Sheared structure is a good way to go forward.,140,,
696,0.97,5085.38,5086.848,And of course King County Metro.,140,,
697,0.97,5086.848,5092.854,We have also begun the search for a consultant who will perform a traffic and revenue study.,140,,
698,0.97,5092.854,5111.172,That will examine both how traffic is going to move and whether or not Tolling or other forms of user fees are an important part of how we can move forward.,140,,
699,0.97,5111.172,5114.409,That is a long process is going to involve a great deal of equity work.,140,,
700,0.97,5114.409,5130.091,"That is a key request we have in the Rfq as well as a vote and, many, many more conversations with ourselves and other elected officials around the state.",140,,
701,0.97,5130.091,5132.093,Next slide please.,140,,
702,0.97,5132.093,5134.496,Councilmember Herbold.,140,,
703,0.97,5134.496,5168.496,"Again I just want to, I really appreciate the collaboration with other jurisdictions of government around the financial needs to repair or replace, in particular I want to thank Congresswoman Paul for her collaboration and communication with our office and Sdot as it relates to notifying us of this Tifia grant.",141,,
704,0.97,5168.496,5194.856,"I just want to quickly if you don't mind, touch on the importance of the traffic and revenue study you, funding sources like the Tifia grant, also if the infrastructure bill ever, the Federal infrastructure bill ever gets off the ground, I think there is a similar importance to this type of traffic and revenue study.",141,,
705,0.97,5194.856,5198.293,That is exactly right.,142,,
706,0.97,5198.293,5203.798,Tifia is actually a low interest loan program.,142,,
707,0.97,5203.798,5206.201,Any money we got through Tifia we would need to pay back.,142,,
708,0.97,5206.201,5208.469,Just like we would pay back a bond issue.,142,,
709,0.97,5208.469,5226.721,"So should we decide one of the ways we want to pay not only for the construction of the repaired or new branch, as well as the ongoing maintenance of that structure, has to be an option in the current environment.",142,,
710,0.97,5226.721,5231.426,An option we have to look at closely.,142,,
711,0.97,5231.426,5233.027,"Not, we don't have any foregone conclusions here.",142,,
712,0.97,5233.027,5256.417,"But either to pay back bonds or to pay back a Tifia loan you would need to have a revenue source . Indeed, to get permission to toll not only from the voters, but also the Washington state transportation Commission we are required to have this Investment-grade study.",142,,
713,0.97,5256.417,5257.819,So we don't know where we are.,142,,
714,0.97,5257.819,5260.255,We don't know how much this whole project is going to cost.,142,,
715,0.97,5260.255,5266.361,We wanted to make sure we were taking steps right now to prepare us in case it is the direction we need to go.,142,,
716,0.97,5266.361,5280.942,In addition at the Federal level certainly we are pursuing both authorizing and appropriations pathways to funding for the bridge.,142,,
717,0.97,5280.942,5297.292,"And, we have a constant an ongoing conversation with all of our transportation partners in the region and they all absolutely understand the critical important of the West Seattle bridge.",142,,
718,0.97,5297.292,5316.277,"Not just for the people of the West Seattle and Duwamish Valley, but to support our port economy and how critical it is going to be as we try to make a comeback from Covid.",142,,
719,0.97,5316.277,5326.888,Tolling is a really big subject and big topic that the city has not looked at in depth yet.,143,,
720,0.97,5326.888,5332.794,"As heather said, there is no foregone conclusions about what that will yield.",143,,
721,0.97,5332.794,5347.608,"But it will give us a good sense of what the policy Trade- offs and what some policy levers might be thinking about, how to manage the construction of the bridge and all the financial aspects as well.",143,,
722,0.97,5347.608,5348.009,Thank you.,144,,
723,0.97,5348.009,5359.821,I want to thank Sdot combining request for this Council bill for the $70 million with a general update on the West Seattle bridge.,144,,
724,0.97,5359.821,5368.062,"Because we haven't heard from you in this particular forum for a while even though you been out in the community, even doing a bunch of meetings with folks.",144,,
725,0.97,5368.062,5372.567,We want to thank you for combining all in one piece here for us.,144,,
726,0.97,5372.567,5379.073,"Councilmembers on the committee, any other questions for Sdot at this time?",144,,
727,0.97,5379.073,5383.244,And I want to give Calvin an opportunity to Chime in as well.,144,,
728,0.97,5383.377,5389.65,I don't see any other questions right now.,145,,
729,0.97,5389.65,5391.486,"Calvin, how are you doing with this proposal?",145,,
730,0.97,5391.486,5395.523,I just have two comments I like to make sure to bring to your attention.,146,,
731,0.97,5395.523,5406.3,"One is, this legislation essentially does pledge $100 million of bond revenue in 2021.",146,,
732,0.97,5406.3,5408.569,That will have an impact on your consideration of the 2021 budget.,146,,
733,0.97,5408.569,5411.005,"That will reduce the debt capacity available, that's the way this works.",146,,
734,0.97,5411.005,5418.079,I just want to highlight that you will end up seeing this in the budget the comes across in the fall.,146,,
735,0.97,5418.079,5431.092,"And a second item I wanted to raise to you, you may recall in the summer 2020 budget rebalancing Councilmember Herbold sponsored an amendment to include the West Seattle bridge as a CIP project.",146,,
736,0.97,5431.092,5442.837,So there is a topical amendment I'd like to request the Council consider on section 6 of this legislation which currently says the West Seattle bridge project is established in CIP.,146,,
737,0.97,5442.837,5456.05,I'd ask you consider amending it to state substituted . I have confirmed this with this morning who asked for this,146,,
738,0.97,5456.05,5459.32,Thank you.,147,,
739,0.97,5459.32,5465.026,Let me address both of those items.,147,,
740,0.97,5465.026,5467.462,"First of all, the $100 million includes the $70 million.",147,,
741,0.97,5467.462,5479.64,$70 million being loaned to Sdot this year and the legislation anticipates bond sales up to $100 million support another $30 million for next year spending.,148,,
742,0.97,5479.64,5484.679,So $70 million plus $3 million gets us to the $100 million total.,149,,
743,0.97,5484.679,5486.948,Not $130 million total.,149,,
744,0.97,5486.948,5488.783,Good.,149,,
745,0.97,5488.783,5510.304,The Council bill before us says section 6 immediate response and Ctr C110 project is established in the 2025 adopted capital improvement program as described in attachment eight.,149,,
746,0.97,5510.304,5517.612,What I hear you saying is you would like us to amend that.,149,,
747,0.97,5517.612,5521.682,Could you restate what would be struck and added?,149,,
748,0.97,5521.682,5525.72,The word struck would be replaced with the word substituted.,150,,
749,0.97,5525.72,5542.603,The project is substituted in the 2020/2025 program as described in attachment attached to this ordinance.,151,,
750,0.97,5542.603,5546.04,"I amend the council as such, do I have a second?",151,,
751,0.97,5546.04,5546.641,Second.,152,,
752,0.97,5546.641,5549.51,It is been moved and Seconded?,153,,

774,0.97,5626.287,5643.637,"And heather, I am continually impressed by the magic that you create for our city and our transportation and mobility, whether it's the squeeze downtown with the Viaduct and now the getting to the island of West Seattle.",164,,

801,0.97,5763.824,5766.46,I think the Sdot presentation is a better place to start.,181,,
802,0.97,5766.46,5767.061,Okay great.,182,,
803,0.97,5767.061,5769.73,"Elizabeth,, someone on Sdot will share something on the screen for us.",182,,
804,0.97,5769.73,5774.969,"Yes, thank you for having us.",183,,
805,0.97,5775.102,5777.972,"Elizabeth, could you speak up?",184,,
806,0.97,5777.972,5780.374,Is this better?,185,,
807,0.97,5780.374,5783.677,A little bit.,186,,
808,0.97,5783.677,5786.147,I leaned more forward.,187,,
809,0.97,5786.147,5789.984,Thank you for having us.,187,,
810,0.97,5789.984,5797.124,Will go quickly because another subjects and following.,187,,
811,0.97,5797.124,5797.958,I will go quickly.,187,,
812,0.97,5797.958,5799.46,Let me know if you've questions.,187,,
813,0.97,5799.46,5804.198,"So to want to skip, let's do that.",187,,
814,0.97,5804.198,5809.904,So I want to give you a quick update and background on what the street use fees are.,187,,
815,0.97,5809.904,5813.374,A quick discussion of our proposed fee stages.,187,,
816,0.97,5813.374,5821.415,Reasons and backgrounds why we are proposing these changes and a look at some impacts and a couple project examples.,187,,
817,0.97,5821.415,5822.917,Next slide.,187,,
818,0.97,5822.917,5825.986,A little bit of background.,187,,
819,0.97,5825.986,5834.094,"As far as what streets these are, we have three large buckets of fees that we collect.",187,,
820,0.97,5834.094,5836.33,The first our permit issuance fees and renewal fees.,187,,
821,0.97,5836.33,5843.637,Those are generally used to recover the administrative time of processing permits.,187,,
822,0.97,5843.637,5847.308,"Things like taking in payments and copying paper, filing, that kind of thing.",187,,
823,0.97,5847.308,5849.243,We have hourly service rates.,187,,
824,0.97,5849.243,5856.884,Those are rates that recover our staffing time for previous and inspections.,187,,
825,0.97,5856.884,5862.556,And the third large bucket of money is more discretionary type of Fund and that is what we call our use and obligation fees.,187,,
826,0.97,5862.556,5873.267,Those fees are what are used essentially to Dis-Incentivize use of the right away during construction and minimize the impacts for construction.,187,,
827,0.97,5873.267,5878.973,Those funds--next slide.,187,,
828,0.97,5878.973,5887.448,We are proposing three big changes to the use fee schedules and you will see two schedules in the legislation.,187,,
829,0.97,5887.448,5906.0,"One is ratifying to make effective our changes and traditions for Tempering sidewalks Cafcs and vending, also to include temporary in permits for street closures.",187,,
830,0.97,5906.0,5910.471,Either small spaces in the sidewalk or curb space or full Street closures.,187,,
831,0.97,5910.471,5914.708,The second big change is we are looking at eliminating permit fees for sign permits.,187,,
832,0.97,5914.708,5929.123,We heard in January and Pre- Covid from small businesses that are fees associated with sign permits were fairly expensive and talkative.,187,,
833,0.97,5929.123,5933.027,Of some of the other permits we were issuing.,187,,
834,0.97,5933.027,5934.995,We were looking at eliminating those fees.,187,,
835,0.97,5934.995,5942.336,And finally we are looking at changing air use fees a bit.,187,,
836,0.97,5942.336,5943.27,Sorry about that.,187,,
837,0.97,5943.27,5954.148,"Changing air use fees to better Incentivize, Dis-Incentivize the use of sidewalks, bike lanes and transit lanes.",187,,
838,0.97,5954.148,5973.967,"And also really looking at shifting some of those costs when we originally implemented this we scheduled a few years ago, we were looking at shifting some costs from the middle income housing projects, smaller Townhomes to the larger downtown projects that are more Impactful to more people.",187,,
839,0.97,5973.967,5983.177,And realized it didn't quite meet where we wanted to get so shifting on the use fees.,187,,
840,0.97,5983.177,5986.58,And the biggest thing is changing the methodology used to click those fees.,187,,
841,0.97,5986.58,5994.988,So that it's reducing the amount of data entry time both for the applicant and for us.,187,,
842,0.97,5994.988,5996.724,I will go into that a little later.,187,,
843,0.97,5996.724,6020.114,"We are proposing this now really because we need to implement this along with our launch of the permitting system slated for November 7. not the temporary permits, but the others, Pre-Covid we started working on these so it was a little bit of a scramble to get it to where it is now.",187,,
844,0.97,6020.114,6021.115,All right.,187,,
845,0.97,6021.115,6024.818,Next slide.,187,,
846,0.97,6024.818,6027.421,A quick update on our temporary business recovery permits.,187,,
847,0.97,6027.421,6031.458,As of August 11 we had 158 applications.,187,,
848,0.97,6031.458,6038.632,As of yesterday we had up to 165 applications.,187,,
849,0.97,6038.632,6040.234,We have issued about 84 of them.,187,,
850,0.97,6040.234,6041.502,A little over half.,187,,
851,0.97,6041.502,6050.144,"We are now working on, we've had 12 applications for street closures and four have been issued at this point.",187,,
852,0.97,6050.144,6057.551,Next slide.,187,,
853,0.97,6057.551,6072.966,"Again, some of the reasons we are looking at the change, and I am focusing a lot of this on the use fee methodology, I'm hoping that given the temporary, changes to the temporary permitting everyone is fairly familiar with those I wanted to more highlight the use fee methodology change.",187,,
854,0.97,6072.966,6088.982,"So we are really looking at continuing to align where are use fees are charged, looking at further dissent devising uses of sidewalks, bike lanes and transit facilities.",187,,
855,0.97,6088.982,6090.384,Adding a little transparency in the system.,187,,
856,0.97,6090.384,6096.957,A lot of the transparency will come with the system where applicants can see where they are in the permitting process which is better than where they are now.,187,,
857,0.97,6096.957,6101.595,And really focusing fees on the areas of greatest impact.,187,,
858,0.97,6101.595,6111.171,"Where there are more people, making the use fees a little more proportionate to the impact of people versus the cost of use fees.",187,,
859,0.97,6111.171,6127.421,We are really hoping that the new system in combination with the new calculation will really help to add some transparency and simplify the amount of time used for just data entry.,187,,
860,0.97,6127.421,6148.542,"I have the slide that illustrates that, and then looking at again, reducing fees for businesses as much as possible and promoting the ability for middle and low income housing and kind of the Townhome and smaller home area.",187,,
861,0.97,6148.542,6165.826,What we are looking at really is changing a lot of the factors that go into the use fee calculation and also challenging changing the calculation itself.,187,,
862,0.97,6165.826,6170.063,"We are looking at shifting some of the factors, again increasing the factors that are associated with transit, bikes and pedestrian access.",187,,
863,0.97,6170.063,6177.771,And then looking at increasing the fact of urban centers a bit.,187,,
864,0.97,6177.771,6182.976,That is primarily to cover the offset of the sign fees.,187,,
865,0.97,6182.976,6187.18,Eliminating find the costs but adding a little for urban center use.,187,,
866,0.97,6187.18,6202.162,"Again, reducing the use fee factor if developments happen to be outside . next slide, please.",187,,
867,0.97,6202.162,6204.798,This really talks about how we are stupefying the calculation.,187,,
868,0.97,6204.798,6215.976,So right now for each frontage either applicant or someone in Street use would have to essentially endure four lines of data entry.,187,,
869,0.97,6215.976,6221.815,And we are proposing to reduce that to one line.,187,,
870,0.97,6221.815,6233.427,"If that doesn't seem like a huge deal, but think in the grand scheme of issuing 20,000 permits two-year Itadds up to a significant amount of data entry . next slide, please.",187,,
871,0.97,6233.427,6239.533,A little bit of a look on how this might impact a particular development.,187,,
872,0.97,6239.533,6258.819,"Looking at kind of the development suite issue permits for, it is looking at increasing costs for downtown highs rise elements these were given several projects comparing from 2005 to what our proposal is.",187,,
873,0.97,6258.819,6283.577,"It would increase downtown high- rise development projects, lower the cost for urban village Townhomes, lower the costs to maintain urban village Mixed-Use and then utility projects pay fairly minimal in use fees as it is.",187,,
874,0.97,6283.577,6287.047,Next slide.,187,,
875,0.97,6287.047,6296.957,"So the cost for downtown, if everything remained the same for a given development, the cost would increase.",187,,
876,0.97,6296.957,6306.967,"But there are ways any project could lower the cost and that is specifically by looking at again advertising sidewalks, bike lanes and transit lanes.",187,,
877,0.97,6306.967,6316.91,So there is work in development could do to shift traffic and make sure sidewalks and transit lanes remain open.,187,,
878,0.97,6316.91,6320.38,That would overall lower their cost from before.,187,,
879,0.97,6320.38,6334.528,"A lot of developments, we are hoping with increased costs, or increased usage we can continue to Incentivize the uses of right away for private construction.",187,,
880,0.97,6334.528,6338.632,Next slide.,187,,
881,0.97,6338.632,6346.54,"All we are looking, at the temporary permits of been in effect since June.",187,,
882,0.97,6346.54,6358.552,"We are looking at, we did some preliminary outreach developers back in January and February and did a little reaching out for this legislation . for review.",187,,
883,0.97,6358.552,6368.995,But we are really looking at tying the use fee outreach to our launch of Accela which would happen August through November.,187,,
884,0.97,6368.995,6379.573,And in October we have scheduled public external workshops that we will be using to train people on using the system.,187,,
885,0.97,6379.573,6391.251,"And then, timing, this was our launch of Accela in November, November 7 is the date we would shift from the old system to the new system.",187,,
886,0.97,6391.251,6400.193,It would be really beneficial to have those in effect at the time with you launch.,187,,
887,0.97,6400.193,6401.595,I went through that fairly quickly.,187,,
888,0.97,6401.595,6402.662,I don't know if there any,187,,
889,0.97,6402.662,6403.497,Councilmember Strauss.,188,,
890,0.97,6403.497,6410.57,"Thank you, chair.",189,,
891,0.97,6410.57,6411.171,"Thank you, Elizabeth.",189,,
892,0.97,6411.171,6415.809,Your team has been fantastic and amazing being able to Rollout the sidewalk Cafcs in the Cafc Street permits.,189,,
893,0.97,6415.809,6419.012,I know you have technical names and I'm using plain language.,189,,
894,0.97,6419.012,6423.383,It has changed the fabric of our neighborhoods.,189,,
895,0.97,6423.383,6428.221,We are seeing fewer cars in our downtown business areas.,189,,
896,0.97,6428.221,6438.598,And we are seeing Covid rates not being transmitted in open air.,189,,
897,0.97,6438.598,6444.504,This is using parking spaces in front of shops and sidewalk spaces transforming our city in a really positive an important way.,189,,
898,0.97,6444.504,6460.754,"My only question is is the weather turns, are there considerations we are taking to ensure these businesses are able to use the sidewalk and parking space?",189,,
899,0.97,6460.754,6464.858,Thank you Councilmember Strauss.,190,,
900,0.97,6464.858,6470.864,It's something we're starting to think about is I'm looking outside and the leaves are starting to turn colors a little bit.,190,,
901,0.97,6470.864,6478.972,I think we have been focused on kind of slow and thoughtful Rollout of the permits.,190,,
902,0.97,6478.972,6486.546,I think our next strategy is going to be to do some in person outreach.,190,,
903,0.97,6486.546,6502.162,"Bth for those communities where we are not seeing a lot of applications come in for the temporary sidewalk, if there are needs were not meeting for those permits and if we can add additional options or alternatives.",190,,
904,0.97,6502.162,6514.975,"Also doing outreach to the locations that have permits to see if, how we can keep it going through winter.",190,,
905,0.97,6514.975,6522.082,I'm assuming each business is going to have different and varied needs.,190,,
906,0.97,6522.082,6529.789,I think our next step is really to do that follow-up outreach and information gathering and go from there.,190,,
907,0.97,6529.789,6535.495,I just want to thank you and your team for supporting this work so much.,191,,
908,0.97,6535.495,6539.533,I have further questions.,191,,
909,0.97,6539.533,6541.601,With everything going on I will follow with you off-line.,191,,
910,0.97,6541.601,6550.644,Thank you Councilmember Strauss for your leadership on this issue in terms of helping small businesses figure out other ways to thrive during Covid.,192,,
911,0.97,6550.644,6551.845,Councilmember Herbold.,192,,
912,0.97,6551.845,6603.496,"You may have answered this, I got dropped off for a second, on the call, or on the platform, as it relates generally to my understanding of regulatory fees, for the fees that are going to be free but still require staff work to process, and the fees they are going to reduce the cost of, I'm asking the question, I totally support the work you are doing, I'm asking the question because I have been, every budget process asking the executive to Úidentify regulatory fees that are designed to recover the cost associated with delivering the regulation.",193,,
913,0.97,6603.496,6617.911,"And so, user fee by user fee they have been making recommendations on how to make sure that less general fund dollars are going into supporting those functions.",193,,
914,0.97,6617.911,6652.245,"Just generally, should we expect that these functions that either were going to provide for free or functions that we are, not functions, the permits we are providing for fee or the permits we are reducing the cost to deliver, are the inspections and the reviews of those permits going to be reported by a larger amount of General funds now?",193,,
915,0.97,6652.245,6656.649,Or have we found a way to do them in such a way that they cost less to do?,193,,
916,0.97,6656.649,6689.883,"Not necessarily cost less to do but what we are looking at doing and that is one of the reasons why you've got the increase in use fee calculations or urban centers . It's really looking at ways that with our ability to describe provide discretionary fees on top of straight revenue, are permanent issuance fees and our hourly rates are very much tied to the cost it takes for us to do business.",194,,
917,0.97,6689.883,6702.362,But in our use and occupation fees we are able to use that is a bigger kind of pool that we can look at offsetting some Coughs of positive uses of the right away.,194,,
918,0.97,6702.362,6734.327,We want to have a temporary sidewalk Cafc or other things that go off parties and there's another thing along those lines that we are able to change the amount of those use fees we can increase the use fees to Incentivize right away and take the fees to choose to not leave the sidewalks open and shift those costs or shift those fees.,194,,
919,0.97,6734.327,6742.202,We are able to work within our own costs there.,194,,
920,0.97,6742.202,6746.539,To shift funding.,194,,
921,0.97,6746.539,6748.308,"Thank you, heather, that's helpful.",195,,
922,0.97,6748.308,6755.849,"Thank you Councilmember Herbold . I agree, we want to ensure those benefiting for those are paying for it.",196,,
923,0.97,6755.849,6760.52,We are not using general fund dollars to subsidize to the extent possible.,196,,
924,0.97,6760.52,6770.93,Just to remind you one of Council's standard questions during the budget process is he counting of the cost you center.,197,,
925,0.97,6770.93,6776.569,As I recall last year it did have some other program offerings in the Department.,197,,
926,0.97,6776.569,6788.581,There may be other programs within the Department to use that money but it wasn't Sdot from the industry use cost center.,197,,
927,0.97,6788.581,6789.382,Thank you.,198,,
928,0.97,6789.382,6799.759,Any other questions on this Council bill 119865?,198,,
929,0.97,6799.759,6802.262,Council members I move the committee recommend passage of Council bill 119865.,198,,

949,0.97,6845.038,6848.508,"Okay great, the bill passes committee unanimously.",213,,
950,0.97,6848.508,6853.746,That bill will be sent to the September 8 Seattle city council meeting.,213,,
951,0.97,6853.746,6859.986,That brings us to items number eight and number nine which are about Scooters.,213,,
952,0.97,6859.986,6865.358,"So, they are both separate Council bills.",213,,
953,0.97,6865.358,6866.96,They will have to be voted on separately.,213,,
954,0.97,6866.96,6879.772,The Presenters will be the same and it's the same Powerpoint presentation and we will get all of her questions out at the same time here.,213,,
955,0.97,6879.772,6883.042,But we will have the clerk go ahead and read item ate into the record.,213,,
956,0.97,6883.042,6888.281,You want me to read both eight and nine?,214,,
957,0.97,6888.281,6896.089,Unless I hear negative from the backup clerk I will do that and then we take separate votes.,215,,
958,0.97,6896.089,6926.319,"Council bill 119867, an ordinance relating to the city's traffic code; amending sections 11.46.010 and 11.46.020 of the Seattle municipal code to revise permissible areas of operation in the Right-Of-Way and other public pathways for electric personal Assistive mobility devices and motorized foot Scooters.",215,,
959,0.97,6926.319,6953.947,"Council bill 119 868, an ordinance relating to use of city Right-Of-Way by Free- floating Scooters; amending section 15.17.005 of the Seattle municipal code; adopting a Free-Floating Scooter share program fee schedule; and ratifying and confirming certain prior acts.",215,,
960,0.97,6953.947,6956.316,Thank you.,216,,
961,0.97,6956.316,6963.923,"Okay, so both of these Council bills together to authorize a Scooter pilot program.",216,,
962,0.97,6963.923,6972.565,"We are going to hear from Sdot, from the folks at Sdot and they're going to go through presentation.",216,,
963,0.97,6972.565,6981.574,Councilmember Strauss did you want to have opening remarks and then we can ask Calvin if he wants to say anything for opening remarks?,216,,
964,0.97,6981.574,6982.475,Sure.,217,,
965,0.97,6982.475,6983.776,Thank you.,217,,
966,0.97,6983.776,6990.483,"As I have said before, we've been having this academic decision regarding Scooters for 18 months or longer.",217,,
967,0.97,6990.483,6998.658,I still have many concerns about safety . how we are parking these devices etc.,217,,
968,0.97,6998.658,7008.768,"And the questions we discussed last night, I will let you asked those questions since they are your questions.",217,,
969,0.97,7008.768,7010.803,They are many of the same questions I have.,217,,
970,0.97,7010.803,7039.632,"So while I still have many concerns that I think need to be addressed, we are at a point where the academic conversation has gone on long enough that if we don't try this in the real world to see if this program does work and is appropriate for our city, we are just going to continue circling around the same questions that can only be answered if we try it out in the real world.",217,,
971,0.97,7039.632,7064.357,"That is why I find that a pilot is important and that it's important to move now because if we are able to allow people to write the Scooters in good weather when it's not raining and dark, we have a higher likelihood of people being able to use these in a responsible and effective manner that is taking into consideration their safety.",217,,
972,0.97,7064.357,7068.861,And so I have many questions I will be asking today.,217,,
973,0.97,7068.861,7087.18,"I support the questions you raised with me and others last night . I think some of the points you brought up, chair Pedersen, are going to need to be addressed . I will let you asked that.",217,,
974,0.97,7087.18,7094.42,"All of that to say, we are beyond the point of circling around academic questions we've been asking for the last 18 months.",217,,
975,0.97,7094.42,7095.288,Many have been answered.,217,,
976,0.97,7095.288,7101.194,We have much more understanding of how these organs can work.,217,,
977,0.97,7101.194,7106.165,It is time we test this out in the real world you pilot program.,217,,
978,0.97,7106.165,7119.011,"If at the end of the pilot program or during the pilot program we see the city of Seattle is not suitable for this program because of hills or rain or other factors, then we can end the pilot.",217,,
979,0.97,7119.011,7123.916,"All that said, thank you, chair.",217,,
980,0.97,7123.916,7129.622,Thank you.,218,,
981,0.97,7129.622,7131.491,"Councilmember Morales is here, she is on her phone.",218,,
982,0.97,7131.491,7132.325,She is present.,218,,
983,0.97,7132.325,7139.832,"Calvin from central staff, do you want to add introductory remarks before as that goes into presentation?",218,,
984,0.97,7139.832,7156.849,I think Sdot will highlight this more but I want to reinforce that the first Council bill is really about governing the use of all Scooters and a right away so it covers private users as well as public users it's about getting in line with the state changes that happened earlier in the session.,219,,
985,0.97,7156.849,7168.628,And the second item is the one that focuses on the city's approval of a Free-Floating Scooter sure program.,219,,
986,0.97,7168.628,7176.569,Go ahead and share your screen for your presentation which applies to both Council bills,220,,
987,0.97,7176.569,7177.37,Sounds good.,221,,
988,0.97,7177.37,7214.974,"While Alex is bringing that up I will give a little introduction, again, Sam Zimbabwe director of Sdot and Joe Miller is here are Micro mobility program lead, I just want to talk about how this, both bills particularly the Scooter sure program fits within our mission, vision and core values of providing Seattle as a thriving equitable community powered by dependable transportation and providing safe and affordable access to places and opportunities.",221,,
989,0.97,7214.974,7226.919,We really think the Scooter sure program can help us reach these values . We know people are already buying Scooters and writing them around Seattle.,221,,
990,0.97,7226.919,7228.788,This trend we think will only accelerate in the future.,221,,
991,0.97,7228.788,7232.992,This helps us prepare for these trends and makes sure they are meeting our goals.,221,,
992,0.97,7232.992,7245.905,And also bring and test out a Scooter sure program that we can modify and adapt over time.,221,,
993,0.97,7245.905,7250.743,This is truly a pilot program.,221,,
994,0.97,7250.743,7260.92,We have put together a pilot program that captures the potential mobility gains will protecting pedestrians and people with disabilities.,221,,
995,0.97,7260.92,7268.661,We know this is an ever shifting industry and we know we will need to state nimble and adapt over time.,221,,
996,0.97,7268.661,7272.732,We have seen that shift already within the make sure landscape.,221,,
997,0.97,7272.732,7287.78,"The city, the car share landscape of the city and how small and large changes in external environments affect what and how these Micro mobility and new mobility programs work.",221,,
998,0.97,7287.78,7303.396,We can't depend alone on bike share for the millions of annual trips provided without better understanding what those market conditions are and where and how we will need to evolve and Iterate on those programs overall.,221,,
999,0.97,7303.396,7312.571,"We think this program is the best way to build on our success of bike share and give people in Seattle a clean, healthy and safe transportation option.",221,,
1000,0.97,7312.571,7318.678,I will turn over to Joel who's going to talk through a lot of information.,221,,
1001,0.97,7318.678,7329.388,"Because there is so much, it might answer some of those questions, he's got a lot that walks through with the pilot is and how it will operate and we are both happy to answer questions at the end as well.",221,,
1002,0.97,7329.388,7339.398,"Thank you, Sam and thank you Council members for taking the time to hear us.",222,,
1003,0.97,7339.398,7341.333,I want to quickly go over the presentation.,222,,
1004,0.97,7341.333,7346.505,"We are going to start with a little bit of background, I want to talk a little bit about why now.",222,,
1005,0.97,7346.505,7348.541,The challenges we face.,222,,
1006,0.97,7348.541,7359.251,And then a little bit about the strategies we have developed to address a lot of the issues and questions I know a lot of you have.,222,,
1007,0.97,7359.251,7369.462,And finally get into the actual nuts and bolts of the program and legislation.,222,,
1008,0.97,7369.462,7370.262,What is Scooter sure?,222,,
1009,0.97,7370.262,7372.465,I want to call out the two photos on the right.,222,,
1010,0.97,7372.465,7376.168,The top photo shows your traditional standing Scooter.,222,,
1011,0.97,7376.168,7378.17,That's what we have seen in a lot of other cities.,222,,
1012,0.97,7378.17,7381.841,Proven very popular.,222,,
1013,0.97,7381.841,7384.276,Lower photo shows what we are calling a seated Scooter.,222,,
1014,0.97,7384.276,7389.582,If it's the Rcw definition of a motorized foot Scooter.,222,,
1015,0.97,7389.582,7391.784,And we are excited about what these might offer Seattle.,222,,
1016,0.97,7391.784,7398.491,"They tend to have larger wheels, lower center of gravity.",222,,
1017,0.97,7398.491,7407.867,"And might be both better suited to our conditions, weather and hills and are more useful for people with disabilities.",222,,
1018,0.97,7407.867,7424.617,This would operate similar to bike share . We are advantage in we have seen bike share so we have a good idea of what Scooter sure will look like.,222,,
1019,0.97,7424.617,7428.721,Free-Floating.,222,,
1020,0.97,7428.721,7435.427,They will have a 15 miles per hour limit in these already exist lots of cities.,222,,
1021,0.97,7435.427,7444.804,We have done a lot of work to date . We obviously took lessons from two Iterations of bike shirt and applied it to this.,222,,
1022,0.97,7444.804,7464.523,"We met with over 30 original Stakeholder groups, neighborhood groups, disability rights groups, transportation advocacy Bro, we surveyed residence and did a robust Sepa process and we are here with you for permit and legislation.",222,,
1023,0.97,7464.523,7476.669,This is a photo of another of the seated devices a Midwinter rainy day trying it out.,222,,
1024,0.97,7476.669,7478.47,"Covid-19, it is here.",222,,
1025,0.97,7478.47,7482.975,And we know it is affecting the city in a lot of ways.,222,,
1026,0.97,7482.975,7485.578,Transportation is one of the big concerns.,222,,
1027,0.97,7485.578,7491.951,Air transit that we depend on to get around the city is going to be hurt.,222,,
1028,0.97,7491.951,7501.293,People will be less likely to be in those enclosed spaces and we know there are funding issues with transit as well.,222,,
1029,0.97,7501.293,7503.696,Scooters can help replace some of those trips.,222,,
1030,0.97,7503.696,7507.166,We are seeing exciting things in other cities.,222,,
1031,0.97,7507.166,7511.003,We are seeing a lot of people still use Scooters during Covid.,222,,
1032,0.97,7511.003,7515.307,Interestingly we are seeing the rights happen if Utley.,222,,
1033,0.97,7515.307,7519.578,"In Portland, Detroit, a lot of other cities, people are taking Scooters for longer trips.",222,,
1034,0.97,7519.578,7540.766,"They are going almost 2.5 miles for the average trip? that is telling us that during this time when people are reluctant to get on transit, reluctant to get into car share they are using Scooters to get all the way from where they are to their destination as a real transportation option for essential trips.",222,,
1035,0.97,7540.766,7545.004,Slide.,222,,
1036,0.97,7545.004,7545.838,We have West Seattle.,222,,
1037,0.97,7545.838,7548.073,We already heard a great presentation from heather about that.,222,,
1038,0.97,7548.073,7553.546,This graphic on the right goes through what some of those modes are for 2021.,222,,
1039,0.97,7553.546,7563.656,The really important one is transit and water taxi 18% of people were using transit and water taxi to get off the Peninsula.,222,,
1040,0.97,7563.656,7569.361,Our goal is to get back to 40% in the cities percent is 40%.,222,,
1041,0.97,7569.361,7573.632,Scooters could help that.,222,,
1042,0.97,7573.632,7577.069,"They can help people get to the water taxi, the transit hubs.",222,,
1043,0.97,7577.069,7591.016,"The survey of West Seattle residence that heather talked about, 40% of respondents in a preliminary look at the survey said they would be more likely to use transit it was more accessible.",222,,
1044,0.97,7591.016,7592.918,Scooters can help get people there.,222,,
1045,0.97,7592.918,7600.059,Bike trips.,222,,
1046,0.97,7600.059,7603.862,"1% of people using bikes to get off the peninsula, we are trying to get that to 10%.",222,,
1047,0.97,7603.862,7607.766,If include Scooters that can help.,222,,
1048,0.97,7607.766,7609.401,Vendors are required to serve West Seattle from launch.,222,,
1049,0.97,7609.401,7613.005,And we see that is a robust option.,222,,
1050,0.97,7613.005,7638.797,"Finally, just this week King County wants to there pilot, we can partner with that and Scooters can be a great option only for people to get off the peninsula but to get to their coffee shop, do their essential trips, grocery shopping's, and if they are able to they can use a Scooter for that freeing up the road capacity for the people who need to be in the car.",222,,
1051,0.97,7638.797,7644.336,"Finally, environmental stewardship.",222,,
1052,0.97,7644.336,7647.039,Climate crisis is not going away and Scooters can be part of the solution.,222,,
1053,0.97,7647.039,7660.552,Are starting to see interesting results from surveys done across the U.S. and getting more and more comfortable the people using Scooters to replace car trips.,222,,
1054,0.97,7660.552,7666.425,25% is a low in number.,222,,
1055,0.97,7666.425,7676.635,"Car trips, car share trips, we're excited about that.",222,,
1056,0.97,7676.635,7683.742,There are concerns about the negative environmental impacts of the Lifecycle were added trips for balancing.,222,,
1057,0.97,7683.742,7696.955,"And we are proposing is part of our pilot, it will take all that into account so we can learn what Scooters to for Seattle.",222,,
1058,0.97,7696.955,7709.735,"Challenges and strategies, the image on the right shows one of the Corrals, one of the 150 we built last year using bike sure permit revenue.",222,,
1059,0.97,7709.735,7710.969,That is one of our strategies.,222,,
1060,0.97,7710.969,7720.913,"We will continue to build these and they provide great places for people to Park, they are delineated, clear, and Out-Of- The-Way .'s mother strategies, we are not allowing writing on sidewalks.",222,,
1061,0.97,7720.913,7728.821,We are not proposing to change that.,222,,
1062,0.97,7728.821,7733.092,"Really, continue to have people park in furniture zones, bike racks, and audit that.",222,,
1063,0.97,7733.092,7749.942,"We have developed for bike share kind of a first in the nation, and auditing system where staff or vendors are out there every week looking at how people are parked.",222,,
1064,0.97,7749.942,7753.746,We are proposing to go further with that and adding specific enforcement actions.,222,,
1065,0.97,7753.746,7761.353,We've added the ability to find vendors but also writers.,222,,
1066,0.97,7761.353,7771.063,"We are seeing if a writer after receiving a warning continues to park incorrectly, the vendor will find them $20.",222,,
1067,0.97,7771.063,7774.933,That is something we are excited about.,222,,
1068,0.97,7774.933,7781.64,"Working with disability rights advocates, national Federation for the blind coming up with this robust strategy.",222,,
1069,0.97,7781.64,7791.75,"One more bullet on there is that in the parking education I want to talk about, we know that a lot of times people just swipe through screens.",222,,
1070,0.97,7791.75,7803.195,"You're saying, we need the vendors to develop Quizzes the people need to interact with an answer quickly within their first few rides and every several months thereafter.",222,,
1071,0.97,7803.195,7817.309,"Showing that they understand how to park correctly, right correctly, and really just kind of get the more engaged so they are not leaving these improperly parked.",222,,
1072,0.97,7817.309,7820.813,Finally Geo-Fenced areas.,222,,
1073,0.97,7820.813,7828.32,That is to not allow it to be parked or written there.,222,,
1074,0.97,7828.32,7847.639,That technology has come a long way in the past year and it's starting to get more and more accurate in front of Pike place market if it's inappropriate for Scooters to Parker right there we can tell vendors Geo- fenced that area and we are going to allow them there.,222,,
1075,0.97,7847.639,7849.308,"And then, writer safety is also a big issue.",222,,
1076,0.97,7849.308,7856.949,That is part of the reason we're proposing to allow Scooters on bike lanes on public pass.,222,,
1077,0.97,7856.949,7858.85,Not on sidewalks.,222,,
1078,0.97,7858.85,7862.854,We are also looking at what the top speed is.,222,,
1079,0.97,7862.854,7867.759,We know speed can be a large factor and a lot of serious injuries.,222,,
1080,0.97,7867.759,7870.362,And so we are limiting the top speed to 15 miles per hour.,222,,
1081,0.97,7870.362,7877.736,That is consistent with the top assist speed for bike sure.,222,,
1082,0.97,7877.736,7883.041,"We are going a little further, he saw a lot of studies done that injuries are happening in the first few rides.",222,,
1083,0.97,7883.041,7888.08,"Your sang for the first ride, you need to go slower.",222,,
1084,0.97,7888.08,7890.749,It might not be as convenient or fun it's going to be safer.,222,,
1085,0.97,7890.749,7896.188,That first ride user will have to go 8 miles per hour.,222,,
1086,0.97,7896.188,7904.162,And then we are Incentivizing helmet use.,222,,
1087,0.97,7904.162,7909.201,"That is something we know vendors will district thousands of helmets to people, especially low income people really like that.",222,,
1088,0.97,7909.201,7915.107,There are a lot of programs out there the go farther.,222,,
1089,0.97,7915.107,7923.482,Vendors have developed ways that say take a Selfie before the ride and if you're wearing a helmet you get a discount.,222,,
1090,0.97,7923.482,7926.518,Another vendor has developed a helmet that locks to the device and unlocks before right.,222,,
1091,0.97,7926.518,7937.229,"It has a Biodegradable removable filter, not filter Bedliner so you can take that off and have a clean helmet.",222,,
1092,0.97,7937.229,7949.641,"And finally, we are proposing a joint safety study looking at if Seattle is doing it this way, we are limiting the top speed and we have sits down Scooters, what does that mean?",222,,
1093,0.97,7949.641,7954.112,How does that affect injuries?,222,,
1094,0.97,7954.112,7956.748,How safe is the pilot?,222,,
1095,0.97,7956.748,7962.654,We are Partnering with the University of Washington on that.,222,,
1096,0.97,7962.654,7971.163,"We have had a lot of great conversations, with verbal agreements, once we know the scale of the pilot we can go forward with the scale of that.",222,,
1097,0.97,7971.163,7973.632,And then Covid-19.,222,,
1098,0.97,7973.632,7975.467,"Really, really important.",222,,
1099,0.97,7975.467,7981.073,We have amended the permit to speak specifically to this.,222,,
1100,0.97,7981.073,7995.988,"Vendors have to sanitize the common touch points on their touch a device, that's if they battery swap or Rebalance or bring into the warehouse.",222,,
1101,0.97,7995.988,8000.659,"That generally happens on a daily basis, it might not happen quite as often if they're not written as much.",222,,
1102,0.97,8000.659,8019.311,"Addition they have to sanitize their vehicles, train their staff and importantly, we wrote in that we can add more precautions to this as we go forward . We are still learning a lot about Covid.",222,,
1103,0.97,8019.311,8026.018,Can apply those Learnings.,222,,
1104,0.97,8026.018,8026.284,Equity.,222,,
1105,0.97,8026.284,8036.628,We know that for us to do this it needs to meet the city's values and equity is central to that.,222,,
1106,0.97,8036.628,8039.664,"We are looking at where these are, are they available, are they affordable?",222,,
1107,0.97,8039.664,8043.001,Can people actually access them?,222,,
1108,0.97,8043.001,8049.141,So we are saying that 10% of the Fleet has to be in these specific environmental justice communities.,222,,
1109,0.97,8049.141,8065.023,"These are areas that have lower incomes, less access to jobs, and higher displacement risk and also they don't see a lot of make sure distribution.",222,,
1110,0.97,8065.023,8065.323,Naturally.,222,,
1111,0.97,8065.323,8073.965,"We are saying, you need to forward and put them here . We are requiring low income plans.",222,,
1112,0.97,8073.965,8086.545,"If a resident qualifies for snap benefits or anything like that, then they qualify for a low income plan for any of the vendors.",222,,
1113,0.97,8086.545,8093.485,"We've stipulated that needs to be, the average right needs to be last less.",222,,
1114,0.97,8093.485,8094.486,A dollar 50.,222,,
1115,0.97,8094.486,8102.427,Other vendors of gone above and beyond that to make it a viable option.,222,,
1116,0.97,8102.427,8106.064,"These will be accessible for people without smart phones, credit banking.",222,,
1117,0.97,8106.064,8108.3,I can give details about that if anyone has questions.,222,,
1118,0.97,8108.3,8110.902,The last bullet is really important.,222,,
1119,0.97,8110.902,8130.455,"We are taking a portion of these were having in-depth conversations with low income communities about how we can craft the next version of this, the next version of mobility so can be a great option for specifically people of color.",222,,
1120,0.97,8130.455,8131.89,Specifically low income community's.,222,,
1121,0.97,8131.89,8134.726,And really bring them to the table.,222,,
1122,0.97,8134.726,8140.599,"We will also be able to use that as an opportunity to tell people, there are these low income plans, here's how you sign up.",222,,
1123,0.97,8140.599,8148.94,We will take that role as a city to make sure folks know about it.,222,,
1124,0.97,8148.94,8161.119,"And just a little bit about the overall permits, what we are looking at, three permits with 500 initial devices per vendor.",222,,
1125,0.97,8161.119,8161.453,2000 maximum.,222,,
1126,0.97,8161.453,8164.356,I'm going to go through these in detail.,222,,
1127,0.97,8164.356,8168.326,Permits lot a is for operating bike sure vendors.,222,,
1128,0.97,8168.326,8170.462,Line.,222,,
1129,0.97,8170.462,8176.968,"We see a value in Incentivizing more bikes or investment, this is what keeps make sure in Seattle.",222,,
1130,0.97,8176.968,8188.947,"And seeing how this works as a crossover vendor, is this more friendly to Seattle residence to say, I have one App and it works for both.",222,,
1131,0.97,8188.947,8198.089,"And then the seated Scooter, other cities haven't really looked at doing a seated Scooter in this major proportion of the fleet.",222,,
1132,0.97,8198.089,8204.362,But we want one vendor to lunch with the others with this new device the we are excited about.,222,,
1133,0.97,8204.362,8225.517,"And finally, standing mix Scooter, this is the device proven popular in the next, the third highest scoring or the highest scoring vendor, we get the permits lot number see.",222,,
1134,0.97,8225.517,8235.694,"D, that is nothing we are planning on issuing a launch or probably for the permit period, but we want to remain nimble if there is a new device we think is interesting.",222,,
1135,0.97,8235.694,8243.134,We might want to try a small scale if there something that looks like a great solution.,222,,
1136,0.97,8243.134,8245.937,We want to try unlimited scale.,222,,
1137,0.97,8245.937,8249.174,This digs into the fleet size a little bit.,222,,
1138,0.97,8249.174,8258.016,"You will see the graph on the left is Scooters, Scooter density per square mile.",222,,
1139,0.97,8258.016,8259.651,On the right it is per resident.,222,,
1140,0.97,8259.651,8270.762,You will see launch size and match size fault lordly in line with what others have done.,222,,
1141,0.97,8270.762,8274.265,We are proposing a crazy huge scale.,222,,
1142,0.97,8274.265,8278.069,"And finally, the budget.",222,,
1143,0.97,8278.069,8286.044,We will be asking for $150 per Scooter from these vendors.,222,,
1144,0.97,8286.044,8299.858,"That funds the program, my time, it will help fund bike share, the auditing, all the management the goes into it and it will also bring other things to the city.",222,,
1145,0.97,8299.858,8302.093,"We will continue to build parking, 150 new Corrals last year.",222,,
1146,0.97,8302.093,8306.765,Using the bike share fees.,222,,
1147,0.97,8306.765,8316.708,This year it will shift to Scooter share fees and we can use those to increase parking not only for Scooter share but make sure on private bikes as well.,222,,
1148,0.97,8316.708,8319.978,It will be a great safety benefit for the Streetscape as well.,222,,
1149,0.97,8319.978,8333.525,"Outdoors for all we heard a caller talking about this, this was a partnership I am proud of, we did with outdoors for all using make sure to increase access to Adaptive cycles for people with disabilities.",222,,
1150,0.97,8333.525,8347.338,Break share--Scooter share can continue the partnership to really picture the people with disabilities have access to Adaptive recreation and I'm excited about that.,222,,
1151,0.97,8347.338,8353.011,And finally the Micro mobility focused equity and outreach.,222,,
1152,0.97,8353.011,8365.056,"Making sure motley this pilot but future pilots can really center low income folks, people of color and people with disabilities.",222,,
1153,0.97,8365.056,8369.127,This goes over the two ordinances.,222,,
1154,0.97,8369.127,8374.165,1140 6010 is a traffic ordinance allowing them on bike lanes.,222,,
1155,0.97,8374.165,8378.87,Importantly it allows them on sidewalks only where it's part of a bike path.,222,,
1156,0.97,8378.87,8386.144,We're talking about we don't want Scooters on the bike path.,222,,
1157,0.97,8386.144,8398.389,"And then, 1517 005 allows us to issue permits in charge the street use fee.",222,,
1158,0.97,8398.389,8401.793,"With that, any questions, I'm sure there are some.",222,,
1159,0.97,8401.793,8410.101,Thank you.,223,,
1160,0.97,8410.101,8411.269,"Councilmember Strauss, as a sponsor, please.",223,,
1161,0.97,8411.269,8416.808,I did raise my hand a number of times throughout the presentation.,224,,
1162,0.97,8416.808,8418.877,Let me go back to a couple of slides.,224,,
1163,0.97,8418.877,8422.113,Sorry about that.,225,,
1164,0.97,8422.113,8437.095,"You are great because Joel answered the questions, I'm glad I sat back and listened, especially about parking and enforcement, a question about how are we providing enforcement to both the vendors and users?",226,,
1165,0.97,8437.095,8449.34,I think it is very important we are able to enforce a penalty against users who are not using the devices correctly.,226,,
1166,0.97,8449.34,8461.152,I know in London they have a very prominent sticker that says the user will be find 20 pounds of for improperly parking.,226,,
1167,0.97,8461.152,8466.825,Is this something that is going to be very visible to the public that the user will be find?,226,,
1168,0.97,8466.825,8468.96,For improper use?,226,,
1169,0.97,8468.96,8474.299,"Yeah, we expect that to be a central part of our communications as this launches.",227,,
1170,0.97,8474.299,8479.37,We are working with our team on how we get this Messaging out.,227,,
1171,0.97,8479.37,8486.945,There is a lot of Signage we are requiring on the devices themselves.,227,,
1172,0.97,8486.945,8489.647,We can explore whether this wants to be part of that as well.,227,,
1173,0.97,8489.647,8501.025,"And importantly we are mandating that in the education inapt, that a writer has to look through before they can rent the device, that is featured prominently.",227,,
1174,0.97,8501.025,8510.268,"But we know we need to do a lot of, a big part of the outreach work that I spoke about is also education.",227,,
1175,0.97,8510.268,8520.278,We are drying up and have drawn up a robust plan for what education looks like . and then Covid happen.,227,,
1176,0.97,8520.278,8531.923,And frankly we are exploring how we do the robust education now that we can have In-Person events . We are exploring those as I think a lot of other folks are.,227,,
1177,0.97,8531.923,8541.532,"I think the fines are really important, almost more of an educational tool then and enforcement tool.",227,,
1178,0.97,8541.532,8546.838,But if people know they make it find they're more likely to park correctly.,227,,
1179,0.97,8546.838,8554.946,Putting it on a device we are happy to explore.,227,,
1180,0.97,8554.946,8567.125,"I think that will be important because I think it's just as important for the general public were not using these devices to know that the users are being held responsible for improper use, that will help the public perception of the program.",228,,
1181,0.97,8567.125,8580.872,We also did a Video last year on proper parking for bike share and those are the types of education tools we can do to expand as well.,229,,
1182,0.97,8580.872,8585.043,Moving forward.,229,,
1183,0.97,8585.043,8592.684,"Regarding the 8 miles per hour on the first right, I think it's very good policy.",230,,
1184,0.97,8592.684,8597.789,"I'm wondering, why is it only restricted to the first right?",230,,
1185,0.97,8597.789,8600.291,Should we consider extending it to the second or third ride?,230,,
1186,0.97,8600.291,8603.094,It's something we thought a lot about.,231,,
1187,0.97,8603.094,8608.032,And we heard a lot from both sides.,231,,
1188,0.97,8608.032,8619.777,People were very concerned that if it doesn't in the first few rides doesn't appear to be a good transportation option they are going to use it.,231,,
1189,0.97,8619.777,8629.52,"If they think this is a slow thing, it doesn't get me where I want to go, it's not convenient, I'm going to call PNC or drive my car.",231,,
1190,0.97,8629.52,8634.392,We thought the first right made a lot of sense.,231,,
1191,0.97,8634.392,8642.634,"If it's not working, if we are seeing issues with that, you have the authority to expand that to the first two or three rides and see how that is working.",231,,
1192,0.97,8642.634,8645.136,Great.,232,,
1193,0.97,8645.136,8645.403,Thanks.,232,,
1194,0.97,8645.403,8661.619,What I just heard is is a program is operating we have the ability to extend that ape miles per hour cap to a second ride without changing legislation and do in real time.,232,,
1195,0.97,8661.619,8662.687,Is that a correct understanding?,232,,
1196,0.97,8662.687,8666.057,That is a correct understanding.,233,,
1197,0.97,8666.057,8678.269,"With all of these requirements being in the permit, we have authority to change almost anything to better protect pedestrians, better protect safety, make sure this is meeting our cities goals.",233,,
1198,0.97,8678.269,8679.671,As the program moves forward.,233,,
1199,0.97,8679.671,8690.982,"Things like that, eight miles per hour not working on the first right, if using crashes on the second or third ride we can expend that.",233,,
1200,0.97,8690.982,8693.484,Expand that.,233,,
1201,0.97,8693.484,8706.898,This conversation we are having is example of what I was speaking to earlier that we can continue to have an academic conversation in a vacuum without understanding how operates in the real world.,233,,
1202,0.97,8706.898,8708.499,Let's move forward with the pilot program.,233,,
1203,0.97,8708.499,8719.71,"My next question is in line with this on slide 17, you noted the different levels of permits.",233,,
1204,0.97,8719.71,8747.538,"So we have the bike share vendor 100% seated Scooter, standing or mixed Scooter, is this something that if we are seeing standing Scooters not being appropriate for the city and that seated Scooters are, are we able to adjust these both launch fleet numbers and maximum fleet numbers?",233,,
1205,0.97,8747.538,8755.279,Are we able to adjust those in real-time during the permit process will that require additional legislation?,233,,
1206,0.97,8755.279,8756.814,It will not require legislation.,234,,
1207,0.97,8756.814,8758.316,We have the authority to adjust that as needed.,234,,
1208,0.97,8758.316,8768.259,In the permit there's actually levers to reduce fleets if we are not seen compliance.,234,,
1209,0.97,8768.259,8778.169,"If we are not seen compliance for parking, data, really anything for the equity requirements can both find them and reduce their fleets, they both work differently.",234,,
1210,0.97,8778.169,8786.544,A fleet reduction hurts competitiveness which is sometimes a bigger impediment for the vendor.,234,,
1211,0.97,8786.544,8787.979,But we can adjust these any time.,234,,
1212,0.97,8787.979,8798.556,"One thing I do want to note, lime operates the standard style Scooter, and they are also the one bringing make sure.",234,,
1213,0.97,8798.556,8807.465,If we adjust that down we might have more danger to the bike share program.,234,,
1214,0.97,8807.465,8807.865,Okay.,235,,
1215,0.97,8807.865,8808.866,I think that's helpful.,235,,
1216,0.97,8808.866,8826.851,"It's important for me to note is that if we are seeing the pictures of the seated Scooters seeming like they will have a higher likelihood of being safe on hills or even on the brick that we saw on a rainy day, that looks dangerous.",235,,
1217,0.97,8826.851,8844.835,"No matter what two wheeled device you are using, whether it's a bicycle or Scooter, as we see which of these different types of Scooters are most appropriate for the city it's up appropriate to adjust that in real-time.",235,,
1218,0.97,8844.835,8849.106,"Circling back, I think it was slide 15 regarding equity.",235,,
1219,0.97,8849.106,8858.649,I was just wondering why not more than 10% in environmental justice community areas?,235,,
1220,0.97,8858.649,8859.851,That is a great question.,236,,
1221,0.97,8859.851,8861.285,It is something we struggled with.,236,,
1222,0.97,8861.285,8862.92,Those areas cover about 10% of the city.,236,,
1223,0.97,8862.92,8865.957,So it matches up that way.,236,,
1224,0.97,8865.957,8868.826,And we were looking at a lot of different ways we can grow this.,236,,
1225,0.97,8868.826,8881.772,"But we determined that especially in the spring with Covid happening, we weren't able to have the conversations needed with communities to see what the actual barriers are, and we make this the most equitable program.",236,,
1226,0.97,8881.772,8890.948,"So we thought, let's go with what we know worked okay with bike share . It wasn't perfect.",236,,
1227,0.97,8890.948,8905.696,"But we said let's take that status quo, with continue with the, let's invest in this program and having those conversations so we know what the best approach is that really comes from the community to address this large equity question.",236,,
1228,0.97,8905.696,8908.199,Thank you.,237,,
1229,0.97,8908.199,8912.87,If we were to adjust this upward to 15% when we need to do that in legislation?,237,,
1230,0.97,8912.87,8915.706,"No, that's part of the permit.",238,,
1231,0.97,8915.706,8934.425,I think that is something we should likely to . I'm going to reserve the rest of my questions because I know chair Pedersen has a number of questions I have I don't want to take anything that he is already shared with me because that would be unfair.,239,,
1232,0.97,8934.425,8936.06,He's got some really good questions as well.,239,,
1233,0.97,8936.06,8940.097,I will step back.,239,,
1234,0.97,8940.097,8941.332,"Soul, thank you very much.",239,,
1235,0.97,8941.332,8942.533,Thank you Councilmember.,240,,
1236,0.97,8942.533,8946.604,Councilmember Herbold and then Councilmember Morales.,241,,
1237,0.97,8946.604,8958.95,"I'm going to ask my questions and Unfortunately I'm going to ask Calvin and I know my staff is monitoring this, to monitor the answers and get back to me.",242,,
1238,0.97,8958.95,8963.854,Have to get onto the Seattle bridge community task force meeting.,242,,
1239,0.97,8963.854,8989.814,"Following up on Councilmember Strauss's issue related to the equity allotment, for particular neighborhoods, I appreciate it appears the 10% mark is identified in recognition that is roughly the proportion of the city that is represented by those neighborhoods.",242,,
1240,0.97,8989.814,8995.953,What I would like to remind everybody that that is not the definition of equity.,242,,
1241,0.97,8995.953,8996.987,Equity is not equal.,242,,
1242,0.97,8996.987,9003.16,It is recognizing that some areas of the city with historic Dis-Investments require more investments.,242,,
1243,0.97,9003.16,9009.8,I would be very interested in increasing those percentages as well.,242,,
1244,0.97,9009.8,9060.418,"As it relates to the enforcement question, I as somebody who has for a long time been very concerned about the use of Scooters on sidewalks, sidewalks are for walking, as well as the the parking of Scooters in ways that impede the use of sidewalks, I would like to request we think about this enforcement question a little differently then a finding approach, I don't know if this is possible, and I don't know if it's possible to instead of finding people who park or right on the sidewalk, whether or not we can Deactivate the use.",242,,
1245,0.97,9060.418,9067.158,I say this because I really want our city and Council to be consistent in our approach around monetary fines.,242,,
1246,0.97,9067.158,9089.847,We have received a study that the city council requested from the Seattle court doing an inventory of all of the fines and monetary sanctions but the Seattle municipal court issues because we want to reduce the disparate impact of these monetary fines on low income people and communities of color.,242,,
1247,0.97,9089.847,9110.801,"So on one hand, I am really supportive of reducing the fines associated with traffic Infractions, on the other hand I'm concerned we may be adding on another layer of fines for this potential new use.",242,,
1248,0.97,9110.801,9140.898,"As it relates specifically to the plan to increase service in West Seattle, I may not have the detail on what it is you're asking vendors, but simply a plan to increase Scooter use in West Seattle, I don't think is fully sufficient to Incentivize the kind of service I would like to see in West Seattle.",242,,
1249,0.97,9140.898,9154.311,"I think because there is very low service right now citywide of Scooters it would be easy, and easy bar for competing vendor to produce a specific plan to increase service in West Seattle.",242,,
1250,0.97,9154.311,9167.258,What I would like to see more of is a specific plan to increase the use of Scooters to fulfill that last mile function.,242,,
1251,0.97,9167.258,9177.668,"To get folks onto buses, that is the real nut to crack for West Seattle.",242,,
1252,0.97,9177.668,9189.046,Especially considering that studies show that writers of Scooters are only 25% replacing single occupancy vehicle writers.,242,,
1253,0.97,9189.046,9199.39,"75% are people who are moving from walking, Cycling or using the transportation to Scooters.",242,,
1254,0.97,9199.39,9211.602,"So, we don't need--I mean moving people out of cars is great, but I don't want to necessarily move people out of buses onto Scooters.",242,,
1255,0.97,9211.602,9218.509,I want to move more people from Scooters onto buses.,242,,
1256,0.97,9218.509,9239.897,"The other question related specifically to West Seattle, since there is a pilot project in white center I'm interested to know and whether or not riders are able to cross the city limits back and forth between white center and West Seattle . and my final question is we keep calling this a pilot project.",242,,
1257,0.97,9239.897,9245.736,I don't understand how this is a pilot project.,242,,
1258,0.97,9245.736,9249.34,The legislation seems to permanently authorize this program.,242,,
1259,0.97,9249.34,9267.458,"The back of the envelope math is a number of devices that the fee would support, it was like 6000, it doesn't seem to be confined to particular geographic area.",242,,
1260,0.97,9267.458,9269.66,It doesn't seem to be confined to a particular time period.,242,,
1261,0.97,9269.66,9279.837,I don't really understand how and why we are thinking of this as a pilot.,242,,
1262,0.97,9279.837,9284.975,"With that, I'm going to log off and get onto my other call and look forward to getting answers to the questions before full council.",242,,
1263,0.97,9284.975,9289.58,Thank you.,242,,
1264,0.97,9289.58,9293.984,Should I go through and answer these questions for the record?,243,,
1265,0.97,9293.984,9295.252,Yes please.,244,,
1266,0.97,9295.252,9300.157,Great.,245,,
1267,0.97,9300.157,9304.795,"If I Miss one or someone else, please let me know.",245,,
1268,0.97,9304.795,9312.97,"The equity focus neighborhoods, that was a very astute question.",245,,
1269,0.97,9312.97,9317.374,Thank you for the opportunity to talk a little more about this.,245,,
1270,0.97,9317.374,9322.513,The geographic distribution requirements are one tool.,245,,
1271,0.97,9322.513,9330.988,"Yes, there might be Scooters in the neighborhood but they make, they might not be where we want them to be.",245,,
1272,0.97,9330.988,9339.797,We may raise that requirement to 30% and 20% sits unused because of the desire is not there are women done enough education put them in the right place.,245,,
1273,0.97,9339.797,9345.235,Maybe they are not in the business district.,245,,
1274,0.97,9345.235,9353.744,That's what I was talking about when you are talking about really having those conversations with communities to learn how we can address this.,245,,
1275,0.97,9353.744,9358.048,We know the distribution requirement is a very blunt tool.,245,,
1276,0.97,9358.048,9366.023,We know it is not speaking to any nuances and not particularly speaking to equity like Councilmember Herbold pointed out.,245,,
1277,0.97,9366.023,9373.063,We do know is a great starting point and we need to have these conversations.,245,,
1278,0.97,9373.063,9376.266,That was the thought behind that.,245,,
1279,0.97,9376.266,9380.704,Adjusting fines to Deactivate use.,245,,
1280,0.97,9380.704,9396.253,"One thing I didn't mention that I should've was that users using the low income programs, we would push the more to education, awareness, things like that.",245,,
1281,0.97,9396.253,9402.159,We don't want to throw a $20 fine to someone using a low income program that's going to be a large detriment.,245,,
1282,0.97,9402.159,9412.903,For all of these areas we also enter applications to vendors said how are you going to address these things?,245,,
1283,0.97,9412.903,9418.008,A lot of vendors said here is our chart for one week Deactivate a writer.,245,,
1284,0.97,9418.008,9426.717,A lot of them had after two or three Infractions that showed that they work parking or writing or using these correctly they would Deactivate.,245,,
1285,0.97,9426.717,9428.786,That is something we can talk about.,245,,
1286,0.97,9428.786,9430.821,At something we could do is a city as well.,245,,
1287,0.97,9430.821,9432.222,We know these will be new.,245,,
1288,0.97,9432.222,9439.53,Some people won't know the rules and we want to work with them to educate them.,245,,
1289,0.97,9439.53,9451.942,"That's what we really like about the fine, he gives us a chance, they could still use them in the future place of car trips.",245,,
1290,0.97,9451.942,9469.426,"Speaking specifically to West Seattle, easy question, yes, if a vendor is permitted in both the King County pilot in the city of Seattle pilot, they will be able to cross the border.",245,,
1291,0.97,9469.426,9472.462,"If a vendor is not permitted in both, we need to talk about it.",245,,
1292,0.97,9472.462,9475.933,Need to see how we need that to work.,245,,
1293,0.97,9475.933,9481.572,That is one potential for that slot.,245,,
1294,0.97,9481.572,9483.373,We want to craft that carefully.,245,,
1295,0.97,9483.373,9491.982,"The easily answer is yes, if there permitted in both they can take the Scooters back and forth.",245,,
1296,0.97,9491.982,9495.152,Moving people onto buses is a great question.,245,,
1297,0.97,9495.152,9502.493,I think directive Sam Zimbabwe had to hop off.,245,,
1298,0.97,9502.493,9510.601,"In a lot of cities, transit, even before Covid is going down.",245,,
1299,0.97,9510.601,9516.506,Thing were going to take more transit users off the bus onto Scooters was a highly negative thing.,245,,
1300,0.97,9516.506,9525.082,"I think with Covid, with reduced transit and transit capacity, that might not be that large of a negative for us.",245,,
1301,0.97,9525.082,9547.204,"I also want to call out that that 25% that are coming out of cars, it is a smaller number than 75%, but when you're talking about millions and millions of trips, it's a significant reduction in car travel.",245,,
1302,0.97,9547.204,9563.253,"I am Multitasking, I think the biggest thing for the bridge is going to be, for all the Mitigations in West Seattle is going to be all of the above solution and Scooters are going to be part of it.",246,,
1303,0.97,9563.253,9573.83,"They are not going to solve all the problems we talked about earlier this morning about mitigating but we think they can be an important part whether it's Accessing neighborhoods, transit, or even taking longer trips to and from the Peninsula.",246,,
1304,0.97,9573.83,9579.269,"Thank you, Sam.",247,,
1305,0.97,9579.269,9591.081,"The other point is the requirement that they be in West Seattle is kind of the minimum, a blunt tool increasing from zero is easy.",248,,
1306,0.97,9591.081,9602.059,"But we are working with potential vendors on plans, that is part of the application process.",248,,
1307,0.97,9602.059,9618.108,We put out the vendors need to tell us how they are expecting to see things like homes hubs at transit.,248,,
1308,0.97,9618.108,9625.015,"Not just they need to be in West Seattle but they need to be in places, vendors have to have a Well-Thought-Out craft a plan to make sure people can use these to get around.",248,,
1309,0.97,9625.015,9631.822,Like Councilmember Herbold was mentioning.,248,,
1310,0.97,9631.822,9637.394,"Anything I missed, my bosses on the call as well.",248,,
1311,0.97,9637.394,9642.699,Maybe to talk just a little bit about in what way this is a pilot program.,249,,
1312,0.97,9642.699,9652.242,"And I can start and say, I think the size of consideration is important there.",249,,
1313,0.97,9652.242,9664.254,Both because the citywide geography is necessary to understand how different aspects of the city Topographically in terms of density have different effects on the system.,249,,
1314,0.97,9664.254,9665.856,And also to kind of recognize the network effects.,249,,
1315,0.97,9665.856,9671.161,We've seen in some of our other cities who start with pilot areas that are too small.,249,,
1316,0.97,9671.161,9678.268,They're not necessarily able to gain appreciable information about how it's changing travel behavior.,249,,
1317,0.97,9678.268,9704.061,"Our pilot structure is the Iteration and since of conditions that program operator is getting into the program with us understands there is Iteration, there will be opportunities for the city to make changes if we feel like the pilot is not in service of our goals and our objectives.",249,,
1318,0.97,9704.061,9711.001,Ultimately potentially leading to the suspension or ending of the program if we feel like it's not being those goals.,249,,
1319,0.97,9711.001,9722.512,We know those numbers are important to start to seat with the network affect is to build some sense of reliability that if you want to take a trip by shared Micro-Mobility devices are available to you.,249,,
1320,0.97,9722.512,9738.395,We have seen over the last couple of months with reduction in Ike share the decrease in the fleet size has an effect on the use of those vehicles because people just don't know if they leave the house if there is going to be a bike available to them.,249,,
1321,0.97,9738.395,9746.837,There is a certain minimum viable level of density of devices in order to make it a worthwhile travel opportunity or travel alternative.,249,,
1322,0.97,9746.837,9749.539,"Thanks, Alex.",250,,
1323,0.97,9749.539,9759.649,"To expand on that a little further,--Calvin has a question.",250,,
1324,0.97,9759.649,9773.73,"Just to reiterate, I think it's important to kind of note that this legislation really focuses on establishing the fee structure for the Department.",251,,
1325,0.97,9773.73,9775.966,That is the legislative action required to make this possible.,251,,
1326,0.97,9775.966,9793.65,The authority to regulate free floater scooting is established in Seattle municipal court already under the traffic code and other parts of SMC.,251,,
1327,0.97,9793.65,9803.994,"Whether it's called a pilot or not is largely driven by the administrations proposal for how to enact authority and what they are presenting right now is sort of their, how they are stepping into it.",251,,
1328,0.97,9803.994,9822.813,"From a Council perspective, this is asking for authority and it's leaving up to the executives for how they would administer it.",251,,
1329,0.97,9822.813,9828.185,Councilmember Morales.,252,,
1330,0.97,9828.185,9836.693,Thank you.,253,,
1331,0.97,9836.693,9838.161,"I, I am excited about this pilot.",253,,
1332,0.97,9838.161,9852.142,I think it's a great additional tool for trying to get people out of their cars and I can see how it would be really important for those really short trips in the neighborhood.,253,,
1333,0.97,9852.142,9872.796,"I live in South Seattle, so one of the previous slides you had a picture of the parking, the parking dock or Lane and it just made me think, I am glad to hear that Scooters will not be on sidewalks.",253,,
1334,0.97,9872.796,9889.279,"And, I am wondering how we encourage people to use Scooters on roads that are safer for these very small modes.",253,,
1335,0.97,9889.279,9903.493,"I'm thinking about the city in particular and it seems that, and encouragement to be on Greenways, I'm just worried, I'm going to bounce it.",253,,
1336,0.97,9903.493,9932.389,How we keep people safe on these and I don't know if it's right to say we want to discourage them on these major Arterials but maybe you can talk about your plan for educating people on how and where to use Scooters.,253,,
1337,0.97,9932.389,9941.531,One key point we will be doing is not allowing the shared Scooters to be ridden on streets with the speed limit higher than 25 me.,254,,
1338,0.97,9941.531,9943.366,We are looking at the speed differential.,254,,
1339,0.97,9943.366,9944.734,"Going 15, cars are going 30.",254,,
1340,0.97,9944.734,9949.239,We didn't like that differential.,254,,
1341,0.97,9949.239,9957.147,We worked with the traffic engineer and thought 25 made sense.,254,,
1342,0.97,9957.147,9968.959,Their switching Arterials to the lower speed so the kind of like that it lines up nicely for us.,254,,
1343,0.97,9968.959,9982.572,To say there are a lot of streets you can't write on and Scooters would be less useful.,254,,
1344,0.97,9982.572,9985.375,We think the requirements for the Scooters themselves are very robust.,254,,
1345,0.97,9985.375,9987.243,A lot of previous Scooters only had one break.,254,,
1346,0.97,9987.243,9989.679,They were very unstable.,254,,
1347,0.97,9989.679,9991.081,We are requiring two brakes.,254,,
1348,0.97,9991.081,9997.987,The newest devices that the vendors are making and those are very stable.,254,,
1349,0.97,9997.987,10000.19,And the sit style Scooter is something we are excited about.,254,,
1350,0.97,10000.19,10012.402,"Education we talked about it, we are taking a big chunk of the permit fees to do our own education.",254,,
1351,0.97,10012.402,10030.286,"We are struggling with what that looks like doing Covid, trying to work with the media already.",254,,
1352,0.97,10030.286,10036.793,How it's a required.,254,,
1353,0.97,10036.793,10042.899,Making sure people are actually wearing them having vendors that have the device.,254,,
1354,0.97,10042.899,10047.337,That is important.,254,,
1355,0.97,10047.337,10049.339,And then the vendor education.,254,,
1356,0.97,10049.339,10061.351,Vendors have all stepped up with a lot more robust educational materials than they had 18 months ago.,254,,
1357,0.97,10061.351,10066.89,They are starting to take a central role in making sure users know how to use the safely.,254,,
1358,0.97,10066.89,10068.358,Or ride them safely.,254,,
1359,0.97,10068.358,10086.342,"And, we think that is a robust approach cities have done and we're going to monitor and look at the University of Washington and will be able to adjust and say, we are seeing Hotspots, there are too many crashes.",254,,
1360,0.97,10086.342,10089.145,"Or something that feels unsafe, we can go in and address it.",254,,
1361,0.97,10089.145,10091.848,Thank you.,255,,
1362,0.97,10091.848,10092.282,I appreciate that.,255,,
1363,0.97,10092.282,10106.396,For me what this really brings into relief is how important it is for us to actually finish building out the bike master plan because I would feel really comfortable encouraging people to ride a Scooter on the bike trails.,255,,
1364,0.97,10106.396,10117.073,"I can assure you the very people, very few people write 25 miles per hour on Rainier Avenue.",255,,
1365,0.97,10117.073,10126.516,Those are the major thoroughfares through district if you're trying to head North or South.,255,,
1366,0.97,10126.516,10137.727,I am optimistic about this but I think we will need to be monitoring that carefully and I will work with you to make sure that South Enders know how to do this right.,255,,
1367,0.97,10137.727,10142.031,We also love to partner with the stay healthy streets.,256,,
1368,0.97,10142.031,10143.833,We think that is a great program rolled out.,256,,
1369,0.97,10143.833,10157.046,You're using Scooters to increase awareness and do according to campaign and making sure that Scooter riders no there there is a safe alternative.,256,,
1370,0.97,10157.046,10161.918,Thank you.,257,,
1371,0.97,10161.918,10167.924,Councilmember Morales . Council President Gonzalez.,257,,
1372,0.97,10167.924,10169.959,Good afternoon.,258,,
1373,0.97,10169.959,10180.57,I recognize I will try to make my questions crisp.,258,,
1374,0.97,10180.57,10199.489,"I in the past have supported prior legislation to advance a shared Scooter program in the city, I continue to be supportive of this Micro- mobility option to be deployed threat the city.",258,,
1375,0.97,10199.489,10206.195,I acknowledge that circumstances have changed as a result of Covid-19.,258,,
1376,0.97,10206.195,10212.669,That requires the city to take a more measured approach in terms of the implementation of a shared Scooter program.,258,,
1377,0.97,10212.669,10225.915,"I think that allows the city the opportunity to, in real life make some Iterative changes to the program, the launching of the program.",258,,
1378,0.97,10225.915,10242.298,"What I think I am hearing is hopes of being able to scale of the program in the future based on what we learned from initially entering or allowing these, this program to enter into this market.",258,,
1379,0.97,10242.298,10261.651,"I think that what you're proposing in terms of the model, whether it should be called a pilot program or something else, I understand what it is you're trying to accomplish or at least I think I do.",258,,
1380,0.97,10261.651,10264.053,I do have a few questions however.,258,,
1381,0.97,10264.053,10268.958,I'm going to focus my questions on a few things.,258,,
1382,0.97,10268.958,10283.973,"One is around, and on slide 12, there is sort of the corral concept, providing places to park either bike share or Scooters.",258,,
1383,0.97,10283.973,10307.163,"And I just really want to emphasize and hear from the Department, your thinking on at the macro level, around the need to make sure we are providing people a clear space to park appropriately their devices.",258,,
1384,0.97,10307.163,10328.284,"I say this because, I had an opportunity to spend time in Denmark with folks from Sdot last year around this time last year, they don't have a significant of an issue with people not knowing how to park their bikes and other macro mobility devices.",258,,
1385,0.97,10328.284,10342.699,Because the city has done their work in making sure that they are providing them the spaces in which to store those devices and bikes when they are not in use.,258,,
1386,0.97,10342.699,10375.832,"I feel really strongly that when we talk about the parking and enforcement issues and obstruction, all of those things will continue to be problems so long as we are not being intentional and deliberate as a city in providing the space, actual space and designated dedicated space to making sure that users of these devices have somewhere appropriate to put them.",258,,
1387,0.97,10375.832,10422.478,"It is obvious to me that if we don't do that, and people are going to leave their Scooters and places that create hazards for other thick it's really important for us to hear from the Department, your thinking around making sure there is going to be aggressive, intentional advancement of designated and dedicated areas for parking, shared Scooters and bikes in the areas in which the devices will be deployed.",258,,
1388,0.97,10422.478,10426.783,Really good questions.,259,,
1389,0.97,10426.783,10440.663,"I think one of the major issues that has plagued bike share, Scooter share, kind of the Free- floating Micro-Mobility was that it launched with this narrative that you can park it anywhere.",259,,
1390,0.97,10440.663,10448.538,"That was part of the freedom, I can pick this up and leave it were my destination is.",259,,
1391,0.97,10448.538,10450.84,We are working this year to change that narrative.,259,,
1392,0.97,10450.84,10453.409,Need to park it in an appropriate place.,259,,
1393,0.97,10453.409,10455.845,"Bike rack, one of the Corrals.",259,,
1394,0.97,10455.845,10473.062,"I think the education we are doing, the enforcement will move that needle in just how people think about how they can use the system so it's not this, I can just leave it, I don't have to think about it.",259,,
1395,0.97,10473.062,10474.797,You're saying you have to think about it.,259,,
1396,0.97,10474.797,10476.065,Least think about it.,259,,
1397,0.97,10476.065,10483.239,"I'm going to stop you, I think you're taking me down a path I don't want to go.",260,,
1398,0.97,10483.239,10488.144,"I'm sorry, I'm trying to expedite.",260,,
1399,0.97,10488.144,10491.08,This isn't an enforcement only question.,260,,
1400,0.97,10491.08,10510.066,"It is an upstream Proactive effort that the city needs to take, just like we do with cars, to provide designated dedicated space that is a Messer it with the deployment of the plea.",260,,
1401,0.97,10510.066,10519.809,"We will continue to have this cart before the horse conversation around, is enforcement the better mechanism?",260,,
1402,0.97,10519.809,10558.748,"The reality is it's dedicated space for people to properly park their devices once they are done using them, we will be better served not only as users, of the Micro-Mobility options but also concerns of potential obstructions and how that interferes with their ability and use of public space that should be available for other uses.",260,,
1403,0.97,10558.748,10562.018,Thank you for that.,261,,
1404,0.97,10562.018,10566.756,I apologize for taking you on the wrong tangent.,261,,
1405,0.97,10566.756,10567.957,We recognize that fully.,261,,
1406,0.97,10567.957,10578.067,Last year we used bikes are permit fees to build 150 of these Corrals a lot more individual racks around the city.,261,,
1407,0.97,10578.067,10584.173,We know we need to provide places and we're looking at doing that.,261,,
1408,0.97,10584.173,10590.88,Taking a good chunk to continue to build these Corrals.,261,,
1409,0.97,10590.88,10592.081,We got good at it.,261,,
1410,0.97,10592.081,10593.95,We got more efficient.,261,,
1411,0.97,10593.95,10597.987,We want to focus on areas where it's harder.,261,,
1412,0.97,10597.987,10599.989,Where there is more competing Streetscapes.,261,,
1413,0.97,10599.989,10617.106,"We were good last year and adding Corrals, in the neighborhood business district, kind of on the fringe, but where it gets dense and a lot of competition for that curb space, we weren't able to deliver there is much.",261,,
1414,0.97,10617.106,10620.376,This year we want to focus on that.,261,,
1415,0.97,10620.376,10629.518,"Places where it might be more difficult, areas around sound transit station, Entrances to the tunnel, Pioneer square.",261,,
1416,0.97,10629.518,10642.098,"And focus their . I think this year we are not going to set a super ambitious goal for the number, because we want to make sure we can focus on quality.",261,,
1417,0.97,10642.098,10651.841,We want to deliver these Corrals and that will be a big part of the program.,261,,
1418,0.97,10651.841,10653.843,We work with you in developing that as well.,261,,
1419,0.97,10653.843,10668.057,"If I can Interject briefly, part of the way we intend to do that is through better use of real-time or semi real-time data coming from the operators themselves.",262,,
1420,0.97,10668.057,10675.498,Trips starting and ending in particular locations is an indication,262,,
1421,0.97,10682.204,10695.484,I think Seattle has led in Free-Fleeting Microability infrastructure and we want to continue using that Realtime data to be sure we are spending our time and energy in the right places.,263,,
1422,0.97,10695.484,10696.786,I appreciate that.,264,,
1423,0.97,10696.786,10708.33,"I mean, I have said multiple times in the past with the success of these shared mobility programs, they are dependent on a lot of varying factors.",264,,
1424,0.97,10708.33,10719.809,But the most significant concern we continue to hear is about this parking issue.,264,,
1425,0.97,10719.809,10727.049,Today is focused on enforcement on how you can keep people from parking these devices in an improper way.,264,,
1426,0.97,10727.049,10749.605,"I didn't want to lose the opportunity to allow you all to directly address the issues of parking infrastructure, which I think is a more upstream appropriate way to deal with the realities of people improperly parking Micromobility devices and over shared mobility options throughout the city.",264,,
1427,0.97,10749.605,10793.616,"So I want to continue to work with all of you around making sure that that parking infrastructure conversation isn't going to be left behind and that we are sort of making sure the deployment of the fleet is occurring in parallel with the need for parking infrastructure concerns so we are not put in a position six, seven, eight months from now, people deeming this the program to be a failure because we failed to be nimble and responsive to the parking concerns.",264,,
1428,0.97,10803.025,10812.334,And I think this is not only a program solution but a structure that we wholeheartedly agree with.,265,,
1429,0.97,10812.334,10812.668,Thank you.,266,,
1430,0.97,10812.668,10817.673,I want to talk a little bit more about the equity in the program.,266,,
1431,0.97,10817.673,10824.313,"And I guess before I do that, I want to take a step back, a point of order if I can.",266,,
1432,0.97,10824.313,10829.652,"The legislation that's before us, we have two bills.",266,,
1433,0.97,10829.652,10850.039,That legislation based on my review of it doesn't include approval of the permitting documents.,266,,
1434,0.97,10850.039,10855.578,So we are not approving the requirements with this legislation?,266,,
1435,0.97,10855.578,10867.79,"The piece of legislation that is required is to establish the fee schedule, the amount charged that we are going to collect from the vendors.",267,,
1436,0.97,10867.79,10873.062,The rest of the program is covered under existing Sic authority.,267,,
1437,0.97,10873.062,10873.329,Right.,268,,
1438,0.97,10873.329,10882.538,"So I wanted to be sure because we're spending a lot of time talking about permit requirements, and the legislation itself is quite simple.",268,,
1439,0.97,10882.538,10885.774,"I think in both instances, there are a couple of pages.",268,,
1440,0.97,10885.774,10890.946,This is our opportunity to get on the record around the permit requirements that have been negotiated.,268,,
1441,0.97,10890.946,10895.684,I want to flag a couple of things.,268,,
1442,0.97,10895.684,10910.733,"I acknowledge the permit requirement documents for the Free-Floating Scooter share program was not attached on today's agenda, but they are on the S-Dot Website.",268,,
1443,0.97,10910.733,10917.406,I'm looking at the full 49 page document that lays out the specifics around the fee requirements.,268,,
1444,0.97,10917.406,10939.595,"And just really quickly, on the parking issues, which appears on page 11 and continues to I think 13 of that document, there is a reference on page 12.",268,,
1445,0.97,10939.595,10942.398,It's P1.3 where it says parking on sidewalks.,268,,
1446,0.97,10942.398,10946.468,Devices may be parked up right in the furniture zone of the sidewalk.,268,,
1447,0.97,10946.468,10952.441,Devices shall not be parked in a manner that reduced the pedestrian zone to less than six feet.,268,,
1448,0.97,10952.441,10956.011,I want to be sure what the furniture zone is.,268,,
1449,0.97,10956.011,10960.749,I think what it is is that picture we have been seeing on page 12.,268,,
1450,0.97,10960.749,10985.274,"Perhaps we could take a moment, given that language in the parking fee requirement, to make sure it's crystal clear to us and to members of the public what P1.3 actually permits in terms of parking on sidewalks.",268,,
1451,0.97,10985.274,10985.541,Yeah.,269,,
1452,0.97,10985.541,10989.745,"And actually I'll refer you to a couple pages down, page 14.",269,,
1453,0.97,10989.745,11004.793,"For folks that don't have this in front of them, this is also at streets illustrated that we shared.",269,,
1454,0.97,11004.793,11013.035,"This is the strip that's not a clear pedestrian path, the planting strip, other things like that, the parking strip.",269,,
1455,0.97,11013.035,11015.07,That's what we're talking about.,269,,
1456,0.97,11015.07,11016.071,That's the furniture zone.,269,,
1457,0.97,11016.071,11023.946,It has a definition in streets illustrated.,269,,
1458,0.97,11023.946,11026.715,That's what we're Referencing in that document.,269,,
1459,0.97,11026.715,11030.786,"In some areas of the city, downtown it was quite clear it's the furniture zone.",269,,
1460,0.97,11030.786,11035.391,"In other areas of the city, it's not.",269,,
1461,0.97,11035.391,11043.599,"And that's where your point is very well taken that we need to build capacity, and part of this is an infrastructure question.",269,,
1462,0.97,11043.599,11055.177,"And what we need to do also is make sure people understand, here is the legal definition that we are Referencing.",269,,
1463,0.97,11055.177,11069.758,"Leave six feet clear pedestrian path so people with a wheelchair can get by, people that are blind and navigating along the building edge.",269,,
1464,0.97,11069.758,11070.526,The devices shouldn't be there.,269,,
1465,0.97,11070.526,11081.27,Those are some of the things we worked on with the Video last year and a central piece of the education as well.,269,,
1466,0.97,11081.27,11083.038,And I appreciate that.,270,,
1467,0.97,11083.038,11095.751,"I do point that out because I think that while we think we know what the terms mean, in practice it can turn into something quite different.",270,,
1468,0.97,11095.751,11113.135,"So I don't want people to walk away with the impression that every inch of the sidewalk as we understand what a sidewalk is, is off the table as they say.",270,,
1469,0.97,11113.135,11136.625,"There are in fact portions, designated portions of a sidewalk that are not primarily used for pedestrian access that can be used for parking infrastructure under the parking fee requirements that S- DOT negotiated, is that accurate?",270,,
1470,0.97,11136.625,11136.859,Yes.,271,,
1471,0.97,11136.859,11137.126,Okay.,272,,
1472,0.97,11137.126,11151.039,And I think that's where we run into the pickle around enforcement and cleaning up and making sure the vendors know what their obligations are.,272,,
1473,0.97,11151.039,11151.84,I'll shift quickly here.,272,,
1474,0.97,11151.84,11161.049,"On slide 20, I wanted to ask a quick question around slide 20.",272,,
1475,0.97,11161.049,11172.161,Is there any thinking around enhanced Signage or any kind of Signage about this issue related to sidewalk use?,272,,
1476,0.97,11172.161,11186.108,"Again, here we see it talks about riding only allowed when it's in a bike network.",272,,
1477,0.97,11186.108,11194.082,"Again, in Copenhagen, clear Signage lets people know where they can use these and where they are absolutely not permitted.",272,,
1478,0.97,11194.082,11212.134,"I think of it in car driving terms, when you take the license exam, you have to understand that if there isn't a speed limit posted, then the speed limit defaults to--I think it's 30 miles an hour, maybe 25 depending on the area.",272,,
1479,0.97,11212.134,11226.448,But I just want to get an understanding of what S-Dot is going to do in terms of providing clear Signage to users around when it's appropriate to be on sidewalks and went it's not.,272,,
1480,0.97,11226.448,11230.352,"Yeah, Signage is something that a lot of cities have done.",273,,
1481,0.97,11230.352,11235.057,Portland has done a great job with it.,273,,
1482,0.97,11235.057,11237.993,It's definitely in our tool kit.,273,,
1483,0.97,11237.993,11243.832,"As we are developing a robust education program, it is something that we'll look at.",273,,
1484,0.97,11243.832,11248.704,It's not something that we are pointing to exactly saying we are going to do that.,273,,
1485,0.97,11248.704,11258.614,I think we want to see where the issues are and respond accordingly.,273,,
1486,0.97,11258.614,11258.88,Okay.,274,,
1487,0.97,11258.88,11266.121,I'm going to keep saying I'm concerned about that Wait-And- see approach on letting problems bubble up.,274,,
1488,0.97,11266.121,11269.057,"I mean, we know problems are going to bubble up.",274,,
1489,0.97,11269.057,11289.177,I want to encourage you all to be more Proactive in that space instead of waiting for the mole to rear its head then having to whack it.,274,,
1490,0.97,11289.177,11306.628,I understand the fee will be as proposed under the bill we are considering is $150 per year per Scooter device.,274,,
1491,0.97,11306.628,11311.566,Fees could affect parking and Micromobility outreach network.,274,,
1492,0.97,11311.566,11328.583,"Can the Department, can you talk about what percentages of funding are allocated to each of these programs?",274,,
1493,0.97,11328.583,11328.817,Yes.,275,,
1494,0.97,11328.817,11332.754,"If you don't have the information, you can get it to us later.",276,,
1495,0.97,11332.754,11342.197,But I would be interested in understanding what the proportional allocation is to each of these proposed programs.,276,,
1496,0.97,11342.197,11350.138,And actually the fiscal NOTE has that breakdown.,277,,
1497,0.97,11350.138,11355.711,And I could refer you to that or we'll touch back with that information.,277,,
1498,0.97,11355.711,11359.848,"I'm sorry, I didn't see--there it is.",278,,
1499,0.97,11359.848,11362.25,There's the breakdown.,278,,
1500,0.97,11362.25,11362.884,I appreciate the directions.,278,,
1501,0.97,11362.884,11363.151,Helpful.,278,,
1502,0.97,11363.151,11370.525,Thank you for helping me understand that.,278,,
1503,0.97,11370.525,11392.781,"Then on Lastly, slide 17 and then 15, which I hoped would be able to go together better--on 17, it talks about all the different categories of the permit types like the kinds of Scooters that will be deployed throughout the city.",278,,
1504,0.97,11392.781,11401.59,"Then slide 15 talks about sort of the equity, geographic areas.",278,,
1505,0.97,11401.59,11414.136,"And I notice Appendix D on page 44 goes into a little more detail on how you came up with these equity zones, I'll call them.",278,,
1506,0.97,11414.136,11426.615,"I think what my concern is here is one, that it's being shared by a program that is not excellent in my opinion.",278,,
1507,0.97,11426.615,11440.495,"Two, it wasn't excellent in my opinion because there wasn't any clear designation on sort of Micropercentages that were going to be require to be deployed in these zones.",278,,
1508,0.97,11440.495,11452.24,"That resulted for example in West Seattle or South Park having literally one bicycle, and everything else was somewhere else.",278,,
1509,0.97,11452.24,11477.365,"So I'm just really concerned that I'm not seeing any language permit fee requirement document that sets a minimum deployment in these environmental justice community areas, setting aside how the assumptions you all made around finding those areas.",278,,
1510,0.97,11477.365,11501.656,"I'm very concerned that we are giving the vendors too much space to decide how to, you know, minimally comply with this goal by putting one thing in one area and putting everything else in areas they think are more profitable.",278,,
1511,0.97,11501.656,11504.693,That's a very fair Callout.,279,,
1512,0.97,11504.693,11515.17,"That gets into our lack of ability to have really in-depth conversations in the past few months, because we did want to address that and talk to the community about, where do you want these?",279,,
1513,0.97,11515.17,11521.877,What is the need in that central area versus the South area on that map and the North area?,279,,
1514,0.97,11521.877,11527.115,We weren't able to have those conversations with Covid.,279,,
1515,0.97,11527.115,11530.685,"So we thought, we'll start with this.",279,,
1516,0.97,11530.685,11531.052,It's the base.,279,,
1517,0.97,11531.052,11531.786,It's not perfect.,279,,
1518,0.97,11531.786,11538.426,"And we can adjust this as we go, as we start to learn what's happening.",279,,
1519,0.97,11538.426,11547.102,"And we maintain that authority to say, Okay, we see you're not putting any device down in the Southern portion of the city or the northern portion of the city.",279,,
1520,0.97,11547.102,11549.237,You need to do that now.,279,,
1521,0.97,11549.237,11553.942,And we have that authority to do that and we plan to.,279,,
1522,0.97,11553.942,11556.011,We plan to see how this goes.,279,,
1523,0.97,11556.011,11563.451,It's really important to hear from folks about where this should be.,279,,
1524,0.97,11563.451,11566.254,Then also look at other Metrics.,279,,
1525,0.97,11566.254,11569.558,"I think the use in these neighborhoods, those are really important.",279,,
1526,0.97,11569.558,11578.633,"Those are things we are planning on looking at, not just are the Scooters there as an option but not being used.",279,,
1527,0.97,11578.633,11585.273,"How do we get people on them, get people using them with low income plans?",279,,
1528,0.97,11585.273,11585.907,That wasn't in bike share.,279,,
1529,0.97,11585.907,11602.19,Vendors have to report how many and what percentage of their trips were using these programs so we can adjust and grow those accordingly.,279,,
1530,0.97,11602.19,11603.792,Okay.,280,,
1531,0.97,11603.792,11606.594,Thank you so much.,280,,
1532,0.97,11606.594,11607.662,"Thank you, Council President.",281,,
1533,0.97,11607.662,11611.333,I'll go ahead with my questions now.,281,,
1534,0.97,11611.333,11639.828,"One thing that could be helpful Fr the general public and this process, when the item advances out of the committee and goes to full Council, as early as September 8th, to have a question and answer document that we post Online with supporting materials, so you can include all the questions asked today and type out your answers.",281,,
1535,0.97,11639.828,11649.037,You'll have hopefully the permitting document that you had circulated before the committee was starting.,281,,
1536,0.97,11649.037,11650.839,That's a helpful document.,281,,
1537,0.97,11650.839,11661.716,"So when this presumably advances out of this Committee and advances to full council September 8th, there will be supporting documents and permitting details.",281,,
1538,0.97,11661.716,11666.921,I think that would be helpful for the public and the media.,281,,
1539,0.97,11666.921,11675.664,I know the permitting document is going to go up Online on our committee site as well.,281,,
1540,0.97,11675.664,11684.673,Thank you to my Council colleagues who asked questions about the equity and parking requirements.,281,,
1541,0.97,11684.673,11689.411,Also one of the main issues was having dedicated parking spaces for this.,281,,
1542,0.97,11689.411,11694.983,I want to talk about safety and financial liability issues.,281,,
1543,0.97,11694.983,11706.694,And I want to talk about the legislation in general in terms of it being called a pilot but then it doesn't say it's a pilot anywhere.,281,,
1544,0.97,11706.694,11714.669,So that's a big concern to me.,281,,
1545,0.97,11714.669,11727.849,"I don't the actual ordinance defines the pilot program at King County, which they just passed.",281,,
1546,0.97,11727.849,11730.018,I'm interested in exploring that.,281,,
1547,0.97,11730.018,11731.82,We can talk about that in a moment.,281,,
1548,0.97,11731.82,11747.669,"In terms of safety, we received a letter from Dr. Fred Rivera, a national expert on safety issues.",281,,
1549,0.97,11747.669,11758.546,He's a Pediatrician who wrote E- Scooters are dangerous and Scuds around the world demonstrate serious injuries including brain injuries.,281,,
1550,0.97,11758.546,11766.721,He cites multiple recent studies about this issue.,281,,
1551,0.97,11766.721,11776.531,"What I'm hearing from you is that what you're doing to try and mitigate that is have helmets required, so it's on the user of the Scooter.",281,,
1552,0.97,11776.531,11785.807,Then you're doing some sort of requiring the corporations to provide some education on helmet use?,281,,
1553,0.97,11785.807,11794.782,Is that sort of the MITT Gant to what these studies have showed about the physical danger that could occur?,281,,
1554,0.97,11794.782,11799.354,"I think that and actual tools, incentives.",282,,
1555,0.97,11799.354,11803.725,That wasn't a part of the program when these studies were done.,282,,
1556,0.97,11803.725,11812.0,We know more people need to wear helmets.,282,,
1557,0.97,11812.0,11816.704,"By having incentive programs, having them available on the device, we think that will be important.",282,,
1558,0.97,11816.704,11820.175,Are you requiring that as part of your permit?,283,,
1559,0.97,11820.175,11823.645,Those are part of their scored applications.,284,,
1560,0.97,11823.645,11843.832,"So a vendor that has a better helmet program or plan that we are more confident will get more helmets on more people, they will have a higher chance of getting a permit.",284,,
1561,0.97,11843.832,11844.132,Okay.,285,,
1562,0.97,11844.132,11862.55,"Regarding the financial liability, you're asking the city council basically the authorize these private companies to put 6,000 E- Scooters on the market and presumably more later if it's successful.",285,,
1563,0.97,11862.55,11868.69,So how is the city government Indemnified from financial liability?,285,,
1564,0.97,11868.69,11871.125,That's a great question.,286,,
1565,0.97,11871.125,11885.406,The Mayor and city attorney's office have drawn up what they've told me is one of the strongest indemnification languages that protects the city as best we can.,286,,
1566,0.97,11885.406,11910.865,"And any kind of further details, questions, interpretations of that will have to refer to the city attorney's office for executive session.",286,,
1567,0.97,11910.865,11919.007,"And in the fiscal note, you talked about providing infrastructure, providing parking spaces, et cetera.",287,,
1568,0.97,11919.007,11932.587,"Is that accounted for in the fiscal note, those costs that would be associated with that?",287,,
1569,0.97,11932.587,11932.854,Yes.,288,,
1570,0.97,11932.854,11937.725,Let me confirm.,288,,
1571,0.97,11937.725,11945.9,I see it.,289,,
1572,0.97,11945.9,11946.434,"It's 250,000.",289,,
1573,0.97,11946.434,11948.736,Let's talk about the pilot program.,290,,
1574,0.97,11948.736,11953.074,It's being called a pilot but the legislation doesn't mention that.,290,,
1575,0.97,11953.074,11959.48,The King County legislation does mention pilot program and has a specific period of time.,290,,
1576,0.97,11959.48,11963.885,It's also unclear what you're planning to measure.,290,,
1577,0.97,11963.885,11980.134,So what are the Metrics you're using to determine whether it's successful in your opinion and should be continued or expanded? Panded?,290,,
1578,0.97,11980.134,11980.401,Yeah.,291,,
1579,0.97,11980.401,11985.974,I think we can point you two evaluations we have done so far.,291,,
1580,0.97,11985.974,11986.407,That looks at use.,291,,
1581,0.97,11986.407,11990.578,"Are people using them, using them across the city?",291,,
1582,0.97,11990.578,12008.563,"There are surveys of what trips are people doing, recreational trips or more tools for people to get to work or get to their essential trips, things like that?",291,,
1583,0.97,12008.563,12008.896,Then safety.,291,,
1584,0.97,12008.896,12013.267,Safety is a huge one.,291,,
1585,0.97,12013.267,12022.577,I've mentioned the work with the doctor's colleagues and we are excited about that.,291,,
1586,0.97,12022.577,12024.312,He's excited about that work.,291,,
1587,0.97,12024.312,12030.818,"Yeah, I think Sam may want to talk about that more as well.",291,,
1588,0.97,12030.818,12031.119,Sure.,292,,
1589,0.97,12031.119,12035.123,Couple responses on a couple of these questions.,292,,
1590,0.97,12035.123,12045.533,"You know, we did respond to the doctor's letter with some very specific pieces that we are doing to address some of his concerns.",292,,
1591,0.97,12045.533,12051.639,I think the specifics of the liability issues may need to be a conversation with the city attorney's office.,292,,
1592,0.97,12051.639,12063.985,"I will also say that just as with bike share, there will likely be more private bike, more private Scooters than we have in a public shared Scooter program.",292,,
1593,0.97,12063.985,12086.674,"And a lot of the potential liability stems from normal use of those devices, which a Scooter program doesn't necessarily expose us to liability we wouldn't otherwise have by people using those devices in the street.",292,,
1594,0.97,12086.674,12113.067,"And I think some of the questions about the pilot, we are very happy over the coming weeks to follow up and have additional discussion and how we can tie some of the timing or reporting or things like that through the full council approval of the permit fees.",292,,
1595,0.97,12113.067,12137.058,"We do feel like in order to launch a program this year, we are starting to run into some time constraints with the ability to have people get equipment here and get up in running in an orderly way so we can see what happens when it's good weather and not so good weather, as we sometimes have in the fall as well.",292,,
1596,0.97,12137.058,12139.827,Thank you.,293,,
1597,0.97,12139.827,12162.817,Within of the ways to potentially address the concerns that there's nothing where the legislative branch is doing.,293,,
1598,0.97,12162.817,12167.155,"Perhaps put together a companion resolution that says, you know, this is a pilot for this period of time.",293,,
1599,0.97,12167.155,12196.617,"These are the things we're going to measure, and attach the permit requirements to the resolution so that everything is in a comprehensive package for the public and the Council is stating its intent that this is a pilot project.",293,,
1600,0.97,12196.617,12219.84,"As the executive, we are Seding any authority and I'll work with this on staff so there's a more comprehensive view of this, rather than just a single page for one ordinance and single page for another.",293,,
1601,0.97,12219.84,12232.887,We could have it all attached so the legislative branch is having its full say on this program.,293,,
1602,0.97,12232.887,12238.96,And we'd be happy to collaborate on that over the next few weeks as well.,294,,
1603,0.97,12238.96,12239.627,Thank you.,295,,
1604,0.97,12239.627,12251.339,"Council members, any questions before we vote on the first of the two Council bills?",296,,
1605,0.97,12251.339,12251.806,Thank you.,297,,
1606,0.97,12251.806,12274.562,"Just to your point, regarding the pilot duration and document you brought up, just for ease and accessibility for the public to understand the questions that have been asked and answers, for instance the letter we received from Dr.",297,,
1607,0.97,12274.562,12294.715,"Rivera, important for us to understand those were concerns and equally important to read the letter that presenter Zimbabwe came in with today.",297,,
1608,0.97,12294.715,12303.591,"And it could be as simple as I believe your suggestion of doing a companion resolution to outline the community document, et cetera.",297,,
1609,0.97,12303.591,12318.673,I think that could be a smart way to go.,297,,
1610,0.97,12318.673,12319.674,"Thank you, chair.",298,,
1611,0.97,12319.674,12323.844,I'm not hot to trot on a resolution idea.,298,,
1612,0.97,12323.844,12346.033,"I think the more appropriate mechanism, as I'm understanding the proposal, would be to include a court file that has the relevant documents and makes them part of the record that is supportive of why we are advancing these bills at this point.",298,,
1613,0.97,12346.033,12363.15,"That would be a good mechanism by which to include copies of the permit fee requirements that have been posted by Sdot on their Website, on a page dedicated to the share Scooter program.",298,,
1614,0.97,12363.15,12373.427,"It also posts on that site the vendor application, for example.",298,,
1615,0.97,12373.427,12376.764,"You know, we could also post some additional equity analysis documents.",298,,
1616,0.97,12376.764,12393.547,I think we are trying to build a legislative record that addresses in one place the information that was taken into consideration by the Council in weighing the advancement of these two Council bills.,298,,
1617,0.97,12393.547,12403.657,My suggestion would be that we pursue a court file as opposed to a resolution.,298,,
1618,0.97,12403.657,12405.726,"Thank you, Council President.",299,,
1619,0.97,12405.726,12412.833,"For me, a resolution would be important to shake the parameters of the pilot.",299,,
1620,0.97,12412.833,12417.004,I don't think the permit does that.,299,,
1621,0.97,12417.004,12428.082,May I? I'm a little concerned about the framing of using a resolution to shape the pilot program.,300,,
1622,0.97,12428.082,12437.224,"I think we shape this program through binding legislation, which would be an ordinance, not a resolution.",300,,
1623,0.97,12437.224,12452.573,I think we have had extensive conversations about this program which passed city council in terms of advancing.,300,,
1624,0.97,12452.573,12494.315,"If there are additional pieces of information we need around implementation pieces, I think it's appropriate for us to have committee hearings to ask for that additional detail and to be sure the public is aware about the implementation and the monitoring of the implementation so it's transparent and accountable and some of my own issues that I flagged would be addressed in terms of making sure we get a clear understanding of when issues do arise, how is Sdot being responsive to those issues and modifying the program.",300,,
1625,0.97,12494.315,12555.576,"But again, I think what we are seeing here today through these Council bills is a soft launch of the Scooter share program that would allow the Sdot an opportunity to, in a measured and judicious way, evaluate what a small scale deployment of this program by private vendors into the city of Seattle would look like, with the understanding and I think with the direction that it would not be expanded until the research and evaluation was completed on the various components currently included as part of the underlying base legislation and as part of the fee schedule legislation that we are considering here now.",300,,
1626,0.97,12555.576,12562.95,So I worry that introducing a resolution is Relitigating some of the prior choices the Council has made.,300,,
1627,0.97,12562.95,12565.085,That's fine and it's appropriate to do that.,300,,
1628,0.97,12565.085,12585.706,"But if that's where the conversation is headed, then I'd want to have a transparent conversation about the chair's intent or not to fundamentally modify or narrow the scope of the program.",300,,
1629,0.97,12585.706,12586.507,Okay.,301,,
1630,0.97,12586.507,12587.841,That's helpful to hear that.,301,,
1631,0.97,12587.841,12601.689,"It was really just to take, as King County put it in their time frame and what they're looking at in the pilot, it would just be to have our own legislation.",301,,
1632,0.97,12601.689,12607.761,We are taking what Sdot is saying and putting it in a resolution.,301,,
1633,0.97,12607.761,12610.798,"If it's really a pilot, we want to learn from it.",301,,
1634,0.97,12610.798,12623.811,This is what we're going to measure in the pilot.,301,,
1635,0.97,12623.811,12627.481,And that's really it.,301,,
1636,0.97,12627.481,12627.715,Yes?,301,,
1637,0.97,12627.715,12632.319,And another program you could consider is the fall funding program.,302,,
1638,0.97,12632.319,12643.33,It's another opportunity to broach some of these issues and talk about reporting requirements or other issues you may not feel comfortable nailing down just yet.,302,,
1639,0.97,12643.33,12645.232,But we could take that up in the fall.,302,,
1640,0.97,12645.232,12655.843,So that would take the form of a legislative intent to form something like that.,303,,
1641,0.97,12655.843,12657.044,"Yes, or budget advisor.",304,,
1642,0.97,12657.044,12660.948,It depends which issue you wish to move forward on.,304,,
1643,0.97,12660.948,12664.218,There are a number of tools available to us then.,304,,
1644,0.97,12664.218,12677.631,Won't the Scooter program be up and running for four months before a budget Revisal would take place?,305,,
1645,0.97,12677.631,12677.965,Yes.,306,,
1646,0.97,12677.965,12687.174,"There is a period of time, if this is approved currently, that the Department could move forward this year.",306,,
1647,0.97,12687.174,12695.749,I'm highlighting some of the issues about how to expand it could be taken up in the budget.,306,,
1648,0.97,12695.749,12697.351,Thank you for offering that.,307,,
1649,0.97,12697.351,12700.654,I'm trying to get myself comfortable with the legislation.,307,,
1650,0.97,12700.654,12723.21,"I was excited that it was a pilot and when I didn't see that memorialized, that's where I'm raising concern.",307,,
1651,0.97,12723.21,12726.613,"Yes, council member?",307,,
1652,0.97,12726.613,12734.988,I think we really want to put on the record the answers we received to the questions today.,308,,
1653,0.97,12734.988,12743.497,I think that putting Q & amp; a into a resolution would be more difficult than just putting it into a court file.,308,,
1654,0.97,12743.497,12773.327,"And I think as we have come into conversations with with executive departments over this last year regarding different issues of contention where there has been tension between the executive departments and the city Council, that clerk files have been Referenced and clerk files have been a good place to put on the record both questions and answers and duration aspects.",308,,
1655,0.97,12773.327,12791.879,"So I guess I'm just signaling my appetite for a clerk file rather than a resolution at this time, just because it would allow us to put a more immense amount of information that is not just clauses.",308,,
1656,0.97,12791.879,12797.718,I think we could do both.,309,,
1657,0.97,12797.718,12800.287,We can talk about that later.,309,,
1658,0.97,12800.287,12810.097,But the goal today is to vote on these two Council bills and send them full council September 8th.,309,,
1659,0.97,12810.097,12820.741,Any more comments before we take a vote?,309,,
1660,0.97,12820.741,12821.275,Okay.,309,,
1661,0.97,12821.275,12823.877,Hopefully the clerk is still with us.,309,,
1662,0.97,12823.877,12838.258,"I think I'll move that the first bill here, move the committee recommend passage of bill 119867.",309,,
1663,0.97,12838.258,12839.593,Second.,310,,
1664,0.97,12839.593,12843.03,Moved and Seconded.,311,,
1665,0.97,12843.03,12844.331,Any final comments?,311,,
1666,0.97,12844.331,12857.077,Clerk please call the roll on the committee recommendation that the bill move to the full council.,311,,
1667,0.97,12857.077,12859.012,Gonzalez.,312,,
1668,0.97,12859.012,12859.346,Aye.,313,,
1669,0.97,12859.346,12861.048,More,314,,
1670,0.97,12861.048,12862.95,Morales.,315,,
1671,0.97,12862.95,12863.217,Aye.,316,,
1672,0.97,12863.217,12863.917,Strauss.,317,,
1673,0.97,12863.917,12864.151,Yes.,318,,
1674,0.97,12864.151,12865.953,Pedersen.,319,,
1675,0.97,12865.953,12867.054,No.,320,,

1677,0.97,12871.959,12873.06,Thank you.,322,,
1678,0.97,12873.06,12884.071,The motion carries and the recommendation that the bill pass will be sent to the September 8th city council meeting.,322,,
1679,0.97,12884.071,12891.044,"Item nine, I think I'll go ahead and move that.",322,,
1680,0.97,12891.044,12897.05,If there's any final comments you can jump in.,322,,
1681,0.97,12897.05,12906.76,I move we recommend passage of city bill 119868.,322,,
1682,0.97,12906.76,12906.994,Second?,322,,
1683,0.97,12906.994,12907.327,Seconded.,323,,

1697,0.97,12947.968,12953.507,"Item ten, will the clerk read that into the record.",334,,
1698,0.97,12953.507,12984.571,"Council bill 119745 an ordinance granting the University of Washington per Higgs to maintain and operate five existing pedestrian sky bridges located around the perimeter of the Uw campus as a sky bridge network for a ten year term, specifying the conditions under which this permit is grand granted, providing for the acceptance of the permit and conditions and ratifying and confirming certain prior acts.",335,,

1700,0.97,12985.072,12987.841,We have central staff here to give a presentation.,336,,
1701,0.97,12987.841,12994.047,I believe we heard this item previously in the committee.,336,,
1702,0.97,12994.047,13003.39,So we got some questions answered and now we're going to move ahead with it.,336,,
1703,0.97,13003.39,13015.068,Why don't you go ahead and present and then we'll move for passage.,336,,
1704,0.97,13015.068,13026.613,"Just a brief reminder, this legislation would consolidate and renew permission to the University of Washington to maintain five sky bridges over city streets.",337,,
1705,0.97,13026.613,13041.695,"Within is over 15th Avenue northeast, two over northeast Pacific street, and two over northeast Boulevard.",337,,
1706,0.97,13041.695,13053.173,Each of these are heavy Arterials and there are significant grade changes between the central campus and the surrounding parts of the campus there that are connected by the sky bridges.,337,,
1707,0.97,13053.173,13063.85,Most of the sky bridges were built before the Americans with disabilities Act and are not accessible.,337,,
1708,0.97,13063.85,13091.178,"At your last discussion of this bill, there was a request that language--I'm sorry, let me switch--that language in the bill reference a transition plan that the University of Washington is currently undertaking on all three of its campuses.",337,,
1709,0.97,13091.178,13100.987,"It will Prioritize Ada improvements across all campuses, including improvements to sky bridges.",337,,
1710,0.97,13100.987,13120.173,"Also the amendment would recognize that it may be impossible for some of these sky bridges to become Ada accessible, and ask the university to identify alternative accessible routes.",337,,
1711,0.97,13120.173,13121.174,Any questions?,337,,

1721,0.97,13171.825,13191.645,"I appreciate the language here and understand the University has the ability to sort of retrofit some of these bridges, and may preclude some of them from being Retrofitted.",341,,
1722,0.97,13191.645,13200.987,"When we heard this in Committee, my question was whether and how people who have disabilities, how their input was sought.",341,,
1723,0.97,13200.987,13207.093,I didn't feel like I got a very thorough answer from that.,341,,
1724,0.97,13207.093,13240.86,"Nevertheless, I'm glad to see that there will be a report back, and I just want to continue to flag that as we are talking about these issues, whether it is something that can be Retrofitted or not, we need to be sure that institutions are doing the kind of outreach and including people with disabilities in their community engagement work so that we can begin to address in a better and different way how folks are able to get around the city.",341,,
1725,0.97,13240.86,13242.395,Thank you for adding this amendment.,341,,

1732,0.97,13266.82,13291.878,"It is clear to me that these bridges, especially the ones connecting the trail to the athletic field areas will likely be replaced rather than--in short order, as the campus master plan was updated recently and those changes are going to be occurring.",343,,
1733,0.97,13291.878,13314.401,"Nevertheless, we need to be sure thought is put into allowing access for all abilities, because whether or not there are other options, if there is the shortest path for an individual to take, we feed to make that option available for all abilities.",343,,
1734,0.97,13314.401,13320.507,"I'm glad to see this is included and because of this, I'll be able to support the bills today.",343,,

1768,0.97,13406.926,13437.524,"Council bill 119866, an ordinance relating to Seattle public utilities, creating a restricted cash account for depositing donations and gifts authorizing the general Manager/Ceo of Seattle public utilities to accept donations and gifts into the account for the purpose of providing financial assistance to its Low- income customers.",366,,
1769,0.97,13437.524,13439.826,Thank you.,367,,
1770,0.97,13439.826,13442.495,"And we have Mami Hara joining us, thank you.",367,,
1771,0.97,13442.495,13444.731,What a treat for us.,367,,
1772,0.97,13444.731,13447.1,And we have central staff with us.,367,,
1773,0.97,13447.1,13454.941,"Brian, anything you wanted to start with before we hand it over to our general manager and Ceo?",367,,
1774,0.97,13454.941,13456.976,"No, thank you.",368,,
1775,0.97,13456.976,13467.053,"Given the time, I'll just turn it over and I'll share the screen with the presentation.",368,,
1776,0.97,13467.053,13479.065,"Thank you, committee chair and committee members for taking the time to hear about this proposed legislation.",369,,
1777,0.97,13479.065,13487.474,"I want to note that Kahreen Tebeau, who's put a lot of work into this, is also here today.",369,,
1778,0.97,13487.474,13494.714,This is to allow donations and distribute those to low income customers to help them pay their bills.,369,,
1779,0.97,13494.714,13504.424,"We were advised by the city attorney's office that under the city Charter, only the city Council has the authority to receive donations on behalf of the city.",369,,
1780,0.97,13504.424,13518.438,"So in order to operate this donation Fund, we are coming to you to ask for delegation of that authority to Seattle public utilities to receive donations for the specific purpose of helping our low income customers to pay their bills.",369,,
1781,0.97,13518.438,13533.62,"For background, this effort is something that we committed to looking at as part of our customer assistance strategy planning last year, and included in a report in June of last year.",369,,
1782,0.97,13533.62,13542.295,"With Covid-19's economic impacts establishing customer relief programs, it's more important and more urgent than ever.",369,,
1783,0.97,13542.295,13559.012,They are optimistic about this because this proposal enables us to tap into private sector Philanthropy and Substitutethose we provide.,369,,
1784,0.97,13559.012,13579.232,We worked closely with city light and FAS in the development and refinement of this proposal and to provide you with an overview of how people would contribute to the fund and how customers would receive the fund.,369,,
1785,0.97,13579.232,13579.899,"Brian, next slide please.",369,,
1786,0.97,13579.899,13587.84,"In terms of how we would obtain donations, our goal is simply to Ashrine with what city light does today.",369,,
1787,0.97,13587.84,13599.953,"They offer customers and the public the opportunity to donate to help fellow residents pay their electric bills, and we'd like to offer the same opportunity to help customers pay their Spu utility services.",369,,
1788,0.97,13599.953,13614.4,"This would include an option to donate that's available to the public on our Website, as well as the opportunity for customers to donate via their bill payments.",369,,
1789,0.97,13614.4,13615.201,"Next slide, please.",369,,
1790,0.97,13615.201,13625.611,I'd also like to note that we are not shutting off any customer and are not charging any late fees through at least the end of 2020.,369,,
1791,0.97,13625.611,13634.087,"For our customers who are struggling to pay their bills, they are seeing their balances and debt growing and accumulating.",369,,
1792,0.97,13634.087,13639.225,This is not just a problem in the utility sector but for rent and other things as well.,369,,
1793,0.97,13639.225,13647.033,So Finalling ways to get ahead of that and provide relief to customers who are struggling is critical.,369,,
1794,0.97,13647.033,13655.808,"In terms of how we'd distribute the funds, you may recall we have two very important but different and separate utility financial assistance programs.",369,,
1795,0.97,13655.808,13665.918,"You know, on one hand, each of the utilities had an emergency assistance program, designed for one-time emergency bill relief.",369,,
1796,0.97,13665.918,13680.266,"On the other hand, we also have the utility discount program, which provides ongoing assistance with 15% off every Spu bill and every city light bill to qualifying customers.",369,,
1797,0.97,13680.266,13688.074,This legislation and the donation fund would not change or impact Udp in any way.,369,,
1798,0.97,13688.074,13698.818,"Rather, we'd use Spu's emergency assistance program to distribute the funds to households who are already applying to and qualifying for that program.",369,,
1799,0.97,13698.818,13719.005,"You may recall last November Council expanded an ordinance to expand our income assistance program, and it has a higher income threshold than the Udp does now.",369,,
1800,0.97,13719.005,13735.455,"Our plan is to use our emergency assistance program to channel the donations we receive to households already applying to and qualifying for that program, as additional assistance on top of what we currently provide to those households today.",369,,
1801,0.97,13735.455,13743.196,"For the customers struggling to pay their bill and seeking assistance, there won't be any new programs they have to learn about.",369,,
1802,0.97,13743.196,13752.071,They don't have to fill out any new applications or worry about new eligibility criteria.,369,,
1803,0.97,13752.071,13759.545,Nothing will have changed except now they will see a bigger chunk of change from the Spu emergency assistance program than they would see today.,369,,
1804,0.97,13759.545,13772.091,The legislation that was passed last November in addition to raising the income ceiling also increased the amount of assistance that we can provide with our emergency assistance program.,369,,
1805,0.97,13772.091,13776.696,"Before, we could only provide assistance up to 50% of the bill.",369,,
1806,0.97,13776.696,13786.672,"After that ledge was passed, we can provide assistance for 100% of that bill, which is great.",369,,
1807,0.97,13786.672,13799.786,One restriction that's still in place in the Seattle municipal code is the amount of rate payer dollars that we can provide through our rate assistance program to each house old every year.,369,,
1808,0.97,13799.786,13803.556,"For 2020, we are limited to $448 per household.",369,,
1809,0.97,13803.556,13811.731,"Or if the household has children, they can get that dollar amount twice per year.",369,,
1810,0.97,13811.731,13828.414,"So the legislation would allow us to add additional dollars from the donation Fund, whatever is determined relative to Whatwe receive and would be determined at the director's will.",369,,
1811,0.97,13828.414,13829.415,Say it's $200.,369,,
1812,0.97,13829.415,13836.589,"That would be on top of the $448, so the customer could receive $648 instead of $448.",369,,
1813,0.97,13836.589,13840.193,And nothing will have changed in terms of the programs that we offer.,369,,
1814,0.97,13840.193,13852.405,"The alignment of those programs and what the customer needs to do to obtain assistance, so the only difference will be that they can now get more money to help them pay their bills.",369,,
1815,0.97,13852.405,13862.148,We are working with city light on possibly doing a joint fundraising campaign for both of our donation funds to be sure we are coordinated on that.,369,,
1816,0.97,13862.148,13879.098,"And we also estimated that because we are simply funneling the donations through an existing program and households are already applying to the program, the administrative costs would be modest, $40,000 a year, and that includes marketing and a fundraising campaign.",369,,
1817,0.97,13879.098,13886.572,We are able to absorb those costs within our existing budgeted resources.,369,,
1818,0.97,13886.572,13911.097,"Finally, in terms of Timeline, we estimate in about six weeks we could roll the service out with a target launch date of October 1st, which would mean we would be operational during the entire fourth quarter of this year, which would be exciting to be able to provide that resource to our customers.",369,,
1819,0.97,13911.097,13915.801,"With that, I'll take any questions.",369,,
1820,0.97,13915.801,13921.073,"Thank you, general manager Hara.",370,,
1821,0.97,13921.073,13927.88,Any questions for her?,370,,
1822,0.97,13927.88,13929.081,Council member Strauss?,370,,
1823,0.97,13929.081,13931.317,Mostly comments.,371,,
1824,0.97,13931.317,13932.585,Thank you.,372,,
1825,0.97,13932.585,13933.452,"Thank you, director Hara.",372,,
1826,0.97,13933.452,13940.259,I'm excited about this opportunity for families to get a little more assistance if they need it.,372,,
1827,0.97,13940.259,13952.104,"I'm assuming that there would be an education element to this, to let families who are not already involved in these programs participate or know that that is an option.",372,,
1828,0.97,13952.104,13978.965,"And this is probably a question I'll follow up later with you, but as you know, we have a lot of families dealing with broken side sewers, and obviously many of them have been unemployed because of Covid and now have this really large plumbing issue to deal with.",372,,
1829,0.97,13978.965,13996.182,"So I'm interested in talking with you about what additional resources there might be, not for paying bills, but for when somebody has a big infrastructure problem that they are not able to cover.",372,,
1830,0.97,13996.182,13998.584,We'll just talk with you Offline about that.,372,,
1831,0.97,13998.584,14001.487,I know that's an important thing.,372,,
1832,0.97,14001.487,14005.291,I have a dozen or so constituents worried about that right now.,372,,
1833,0.97,14005.291,14024.91,"I appreciate your advocacy on this issue, and you'll be happy to hear that our customer review panel has approved for Spu to move ahead with a project and a study on how we can better help customers with their side sewer issues.",373,,
1834,0.97,14024.91,14032.084,"This is an issue, you know, throughout the city, that hits low income customers particularly hard.",373,,

1846,0.97,14113.065,14123.175,I'm really thankful for how you're moving forward to making sure folks get what they need and don't go into debt.,375,,
1847,0.97,14123.175,14126.912,"Even without a shutoff, they could be racking up debt.",375,,
1848,0.97,14126.912,14133.719,So increasing the threshold and allowing people to have a second emergency fund is so important.,375,,

1857,0.97,14180.032,14196.682,"Wanted to get a better sense from you, director Hara, around what the targets are or goals are for the Spu in terms of dollars raised.",378,,
1858,0.97,14196.682,14199.552,I think I saw the initiative of $200?,378,,
1859,0.97,14199.552,14207.793,Is that what you said in terms of a credit for people who need it?,378,,
1860,0.97,14207.793,14208.427,An additional $200?,378,,
1861,0.97,14208.427,14227.813,Maybe you can talk about the goals around what you're hoping to be able to accomplish through this Public-Private partnership in terms of private dollars coming into help supplement the programs and emergency assistance programs that we already have in place.,378,,
1862,0.97,14227.813,14229.114,That's a great question.,379,,
1863,0.97,14229.114,14238.29,I'm going to have to lean on Kahreen to see if we have any ballpark numbers.,379,,
1864,0.97,14238.29,14249.501,We are focused on trying to see if we can get sponsorship through corporate campaigns that exist already within corporations.,379,,
1865,0.97,14249.501,14252.404,We are very optimistic about that route.,379,,
1866,0.97,14252.404,14256.475,Do you have any ballpark understanding of what might be possible?,379,,
1867,0.97,14256.475,14262.715,"Yeah, we haven't set a specific target, but we are encouraged by the example in Spokane.",380,,
1868,0.97,14262.715,14274.159,"They set up a similar program and within six weeks they had raised $150,000.",380,,
1869,0.97,14274.159,14282.768,"So I think anything is possible but we are new to this, so we have been hesitant to set a specific target.",380,,
1870,0.97,14282.768,14283.202,That's helpful.,381,,
1871,0.97,14283.202,14287.139,I appreciate that reference point.,381,,
1872,0.97,14287.139,14311.297,"And a second question is, based on the data that you all have in the billing system, do you have a sense of, for those falling behind on their bills, what that average amount is, just so we can get a sense of the scale of the need?",381,,
1873,0.97,14311.297,14316.301,I think that would be important to get that on the record.,381,,
1874,0.97,14316.301,14322.274,We do track it and I'll provide it to you as soon as possible.,382,,
