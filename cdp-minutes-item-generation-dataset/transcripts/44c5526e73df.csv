306,0.9128385186195374,1403.6,1414.8,"So recently the council president 2022 introduced the use of the consent calendar on city council agendas to efficiently move through Council business at regulate regularly, scheduled meetings.",,,
307,0.9128385186195374,1414.8,1425.7,"Currently the rules, do not include any guidance, on the use of a consent calendar, but it is within the authority of the council president to cry to adjust, the agenda, as is necessary.",,,
308,0.7725589275360107,1425.9,1429.8, Sorry to efficiently run Council meetings.,,,
309,0.7725589275360107,1429.9,1437.2,"So this resolution would amend rule, 3 of the council rules to provide specific guidance, as it relates to the consent calendar.",,,
310,0.7725589275360107,1439.0,1444.1,"So with the introduction of a consent calendar, any items included on the consent.",,,
311,0.7725589275360107,1444.1,1447.7,Calendar will be considered as a group and they only require a single vote for.,,,
312,0.7725589275360107,1447.7,1450.5,"So, for non-controversial a routine items.",,,
313,0.7725589275360107,1451.1,1455.7,This allows council members to focus on the more substantive issues before the,,,
314,0.72020423412323,1455.8,1460.6, Salon any in any given meeting and move efficiently through more routine legislation.,,,
315,0.8790908455848694,1462.7,1465.0, The rule as proposed would allow again.,,,
316,0.8790908455848694,1465.0,1476.8,Typically would typically add administrative items or items where there is no debate or questions expected from Council Members or no amendments in practice on a regular basis.,,,
317,0.8790908455848694,1476.8,1485.0,The clerks will work with the council president's office to place the following items on the consent calendar approval of the minutes.,,,
318,0.8790908455848694,1485.3,1491.7,The regular payment of claims Bill and any items from the council committees.,,,
319,0.9058172702789307,1491.8,1499.5," Bill's resolutions, clerk files appointment that were recommended for approval by the committee with a unanimous vote and where there were no abstentions.",,,
320,0.9058172702789307,1500.1,1502.5,The rule is written is permissive.,,,
321,0.9058172702789307,1502.5,1509.2,Those are it would allow really any most any item on the agenda to be included in the consent.,,,
322,0.9058172702789307,1509.2,1511.9,"Agenda, other than the introduction and referral calendar.",,,
323,0.9058172702789307,1511.9,1516.5,"However, it doesn't require that any item is placed on the agenda.",,,
324,0.9058172702789307,1516.5,1521.4,So any items proposed for the consent calendar could be removed.,,,
325,0.8892645835876465,1521.8,1529.4, And and added to the regular agenda at the request of any councilmember ideally before the final publication of the city council agenda.,,,
326,0.8892645835876465,1529.4,1539.2,"So that is to say committee chairs committee, clerks as you are doing your minutes for your, a following, a committee discussion.",,,
327,0.8892645835876465,1539.2,1542.8,You will want to let the clerks in the council president's office know.,,,
328,0.8892645835876465,1542.8,1550.1,If there are any items that were voted out with a unanimous recommendation of approval that you would like placed on the regular agenda.,,,
329,0.8892645835876465,1550.1,1551.2,So you have an opportunity,,,
330,0.9128385782241821,1551.8,1554.2, Speak to the item during the full council meeting.,,,
331,0.9128385782241821,1554.7,1560.6,"Otherwise, in most cases that will typically be be placed in the consent calendar.",,,
332,0.8945214748382568,1563.4,1567.3, But you could also request at the meeting itself for an item to be removed.,,,
333,0.8945214748382568,1567.3,1574.6,"But otherwise, if an item is placed in the consent calendar, that item is not up for debate or discussion during the meeting just up for a vote.",,,
334,0.8945214748382568,1575.5,1580.6,So I'll pause there and see if there are any questions about the proposed changes related to the consent calendar.,,,
335,0.8097528219223022,1582.7,1587.1," The only thing I would add, let me see if there are my colleagues have any.",,,
336,0.8097528219223022,1587.2,1588.4,"Oh, I'm sorry, Casper a kid.",,,
337,0.8097528219223022,1588.4,1589.6,I did not see your hand.,,,
338,0.8097528219223022,1589.9,1591.7,It's a different and customer Peterson.,,,
339,0.8097528219223022,1592.3,1593.0,That's okay council.,,,
340,0.8097528219223022,1593.0,1593.5,President.,,,
341,0.8097528219223022,1593.6,1594.7,I'm happy to defer to you.,,,
342,0.8097528219223022,1594.7,1598.1,"If you have something to add to the summer, if you wouldn't mind.",,,
343,0.8097528219223022,1598.1,1600.8,I just want to explain what my reason is.,,,
344,0.8097528219223022,1600.8,1605.5,"And then that might kind of fill out, just the basic stuff and then you guys can pile on.",,,
345,0.8097528219223022,1606.7,1612.1,So I should add that when I became council president that the clerk's office in.,,,
346,0.9048299789428711,1612.4,1621.6," Allure Amelia and Monica gave me my how to manage Council meetings book, which I did look re-tag, certain areas.",,,
347,0.9048299789428711,1621.6,1624.7,So the reason why I wanted to go to a consent counter.,,,
348,0.9048299789428711,1624.7,1631.6,"Basically, as we do that, many of you know, who we sit on King County boards and commissions, and they use a consent calendar.",,,
349,0.9048299789428711,1631.6,1634.0,"Also, I sit on Sound Transit.",,,
350,0.9048299789428711,1634.0,1634.8,We use the consent calendar.,,,
351,0.9048299789428711,1634.8,1642.2,"When I was legal counsel to tribal governments, use a consent calendar and it just makes it easier, but you",,,
352,0.8524430990219116,1642.4,1643.6, Always have the opportunity.,,,
353,0.8524430990219116,1643.6,1648.8,"Any council member as you know, which we've been doing, can pull anything from the consent calendar?",,,
354,0.8524430990219116,1648.8,1657.2,"Most notably or recently Cosmic Morales, had a bunch of appointments and then she wanted a few pulled out of the consent calendar.",,,
355,0.8524430990219116,1657.2,1672.3,"So she could speak to them personally, which was great and that gives you an opportunity to determine what you want to spend time on to discuss or bring up or if there's other questions some of our colleagues may have of what you have, what is in the consent calendar that you",,,
356,0.8675346374511719,1672.5,1673.4, Pull out.,,,
357,0.8675346374511719,1673.4,1675.2,So that's kind of my thinking on that.,,,
358,0.8675346374511719,1675.2,1678.2,So I will leave it at that and customer was going to go ahead.,,,
359,0.9128395915031433,1679.2,1680.1, Thank you very much.,,,
360,0.9128395915031433,1680.4,1685.1,And I do want to thank you council president for the work that you've done to move in this direction already.,,,
361,0.9128395915031433,1686.3,1691.8,"Well, maybe there was a bit of a learning curve for some of us about whether or not we were supposed to speak on things.",,,
362,0.9128395915031433,1691.9,1708.9,"I think it's been much more efficient and I think that to the degree that we can, you know, really communicate to folks who maybe are a appointees that this is, this committee meeting is the time for us to really sing their praises that gives us a chance to really move through some of the other more substantive items on the agenda.",,,
363,0.7550497651100159,1709.3,1723.2," So I like the approach, I'll just say that I have a question before I ask am I or before I see my comment or more sensitive piece on this section, Madam president.",,,
364,0.7550497651100159,1723.2,1727.0,Is it your intention that we're taking a final vote in your committee on this today?,,,
365,0.7550497651100159,1727.1,1729.2,Or was this going to be held over until the next meeting?,,,
366,0.7550497651100159,1729.9,1730.5,"No, we're taking.",,,
367,0.7550497651100159,1730.5,1732.2,"We're voting, because it's okay.",,,
368,0.7550497651100159,1732.2,1734.6,"Well, the resolution has two parts to it.",,,
369,0.7550497651100159,1734.6,1736.7,The consent in the abstention Parts.,,,
370,0.7550497651100159,1736.7,1737.9,"Okay, great.",,,
371,0.7550497651100159,1738.3,1738.6,"Well,",,,
372,0.9128389358520508,1739.3,1741.1, In that case Madam president.,,,
373,0.9128389358520508,1741.1,1743.4,I apologize for not bringing this to your attention earlier.,,,
374,0.9128389358520508,1743.4,1747.1,I would have loved to have maybe run this concept through you.,,,
375,0.9128389358520508,1747.1,1759.6,"So I could understand more about whether or not we were in alignment, but I would note that I think that there's a lot of value and considering routine non-substantive items on the consent calendar.",,,
376,0.9128389358520508,1760.0,1764.8,And I think that that makes sense to include things like resolutions clerk files.,,,
377,0.9128389358520508,1764.8,1765.7,The appointments.,,,
378,0.9128389358520508,1766.4,1768.9,I do have some concern about the votes on bills.,,,
379,0.8244315385818481,1769.0,1784.2," Even if they are unanimous, just given that not all nine of us sit on each committee meeting and I don't want there to be a perception that if a bill is being pulled out for discussion that it's being done in a way to criticize it or two grams down on something.",,,
380,0.8244315385818481,1784.2,1791.6,And I think if we had a policy like this that just struck those words vote on bills or just bills.,,,
381,0.8244315385818481,1791.6,1792.1,I'm not sure.,,,
382,0.8244315385818481,1792.1,1793.0,I defer to the clerk.,,,
383,0.8244315385818481,1793.0,1798.9,"If the intent is to try to take out the things that are non substance of, I think that this would be a great proposal just",,,
384,0.8871971964836121,1799.0,1809.4, Just I would prefer to remove substantive policy bills and I don't want to be in a position or any other council member to be in a position to make the argument for why they're trying to remove something.,,,
385,0.8871971964836121,1809.6,1814.1,"If it was regular practice to have bills, policy bills, not part of the consent calendar.",,,
386,0.8871971964836121,1814.1,1822.3,Then I think we're in a good place to have a discussion and debate on items without necessarily having to remove an item.,,,
387,0.8871971964836121,1822.3,1825.4,I consider our final vote in committee.,,,
388,0.8871971964836121,1825.4,1826.1,And excuse me.,,,
389,0.8871971964836121,1826.1,1828.5,I consider our final vote in full Council.,,,
390,0.726780116558075,1829.0,1836.6," Like our floor debates if you will, if we were in the house or the Senate and just wanted to make sure that everybody has a chance to really understand what they're voting on.",,,
391,0.726780116558075,1836.6,1845.0,My desire would be to seek to see if we could keep bills policy bills separate from the consent calendar.,,,
392,0.726780116558075,1845.5,1847.1,So let me ask you this question mosquitoes.,,,
393,0.726780116558075,1847.1,1858.3,"So your scenario is, which I think if you may be incorrect, but all that the clerk's, I think we if you, if you ask that it, if it passes in committee.",,,
394,0.8114389181137085,1859.1,1863.8, And I still believe that Madam clerk to might have to help me out here.,,,
395,0.8114389181137085,1863.8,1871.7,My understanding is that it would still go to full Council and if you request that it be pulled out of the consent calendar.,,,
396,0.8114389181137085,1872.6,1875.0,I don't think you have to have an argument or,,,
397,0.8996291756629944,1877.5,1878.9," Yeah, that's correct.",,,
398,0.8996291756629944,1878.9,1879.6,I'm president.,,,
399,0.8996291756629944,1880.1,1883.3,I'm getting back to our our budget deliberations.,,,
400,0.8996291756629944,1883.3,1884.3,"For example, right?",,,
401,0.8996291756629944,1884.3,1892.0,We often people will remove an item from the budget consent calendar because they have questions or concerns about it.,,,
402,0.8996291756629944,1892.0,1893.4,And that's absolutely fair.,,,
403,0.8996291756629944,1894.4,1905.9,I think that there is also an opportunity for us to keep policy items separate so that people aren't in a position where they then are asking to remove something and the perception.,,,
404,0.8808703422546387,1906.1,1910.9, Might be that they have questions or concerns or that they're trying to grandstand on something.,,,
405,0.8808703422546387,1911.1,1912.5,It was common practice.,,,
406,0.8808703422546387,1912.5,1915.2,"Yeah, you would want more discussion and that makes sense.",,,
407,0.8808703422546387,1915.2,1916.2,"Like, right?",,,
408,0.8808703422546387,1916.2,1923.1,"If something comes out of committee unanimously, you believe that it also should come to the full Council.",,,
409,0.8808703422546387,1923.1,1924.6,So and not put in the consent.,,,
410,0.8808703422546387,1924.6,1933.9,"So no one is put in a position to have to say, let me pull this because I think there's something I want to say even though it because I'm not on that committee and I wasn't there to provide any kind of comment Madam clerk.",,,
411,0.8808703422546387,1933.9,1934.6,Can you help me out here?,,,
412,0.8808703422546387,1934.6,1935.9,Because I think we went over this.,,,
413,0.8213039040565491,1936.0,1939.8," Us our alley, go ahead and like thank you council president yet.",,,
414,0.8213039040565491,1939.8,1943.0,So maybe I took clarify.,,,
415,0.8213039040565491,1943.0,1955.6,The goal would be that the committee chairs and the committee clerks would would let the council president and clerks know like long before the agenda is being published that they don't want certain items.,,,
416,0.8213039040565491,1955.6,1958.9,"So it wouldn't necessarily have to be, you're removing it in real time.",,,
417,0.8213039040565491,1959.1,1961.9,It would just be we voted these four items out.,,,
418,0.8213039040565491,1961.9,1964.8,"We want none of them on the consent Calendar, please.",,,
419,0.8213039040565491,1964.8,1965.2,And my,,,
420,0.8507733941078186,1966.0,1970.5, Sumption is in most cases that will that guidance will be adhered to.,,,
421,0.8507733941078186,1970.5,1978.1,It's not a it's not going to be debated that if the the chair or councilmember would like an item requested.,,,
422,0.8507733941078186,1978.1,1980.7,We would know that before we're publishing the agenda.,,,
423,0.8507733941078186,1980.7,1987.5,"I'd also just note that the plan is to vote on this resolution today, but not take final action till May 17th.",,,
424,0.8507733941078186,1987.5,1995.8,"So if there is a need to clarify language or think through your concerns councilmember mosquito, there is sometime between now",,,
425,0.8251131772994995,1995.9,2002.8," Now, and then to look at some options for you and your colleagues consideration.",,,
426,0.8251131772994995,2003.6,2006.1,Let me clarify something that this actually came up.,,,
427,0.8251131772994995,2006.1,2006.6,Thank you kiss.,,,
428,0.8251131772994995,2006.6,2008.9,"Aramis, cater for for helping me with my memory.",,,
429,0.8251131772994995,2009.9,2013.2,"We have, since we've been doing this since late January.",,,
430,0.8251131772994995,2014.4,2022.0,We the responsibility of the president's office is to talk to a committee chair before we get print the agenda to say.,,,
431,0.8251131772994995,2022.3,2023.8,Do you want this on the consent calendar?,,,
432,0.8251131772994995,2023.8,2024.5,Do you not?,,,
433,0.8251131772994995,2024.5,2025.8,And so we know?,,,
434,0.7909246683120728,2026.0,2026.4, At a time.,,,
435,0.7909246683120728,2026.4,2034.1,"So no one is going to be put in a position, a committee chair of on the floor during full Council to say, oh, by the way, can you pull this from the?",,,
436,0.7909246683120728,2034.1,2034.8,"It wouldn't, it?",,,
437,0.7909246683120728,2034.8,2039.1,"Wouldn't, it wouldn't be there and when in doubt, it would not be in there.",,,
438,0.7909246683120728,2039.5,2040.8,So does that make sense?,,,
439,0.7909246683120728,2041.1,2042.2,"Yeah, that makes sense.",,,
440,0.7909246683120728,2042.7,2047.9,"And again, I appreciate the work that you've done on this, and I apologize that I didn't get the chance to talk to you about this concern in advance.",,,
441,0.7909246683120728,2048.3,2055.8,"I think that if the intent is to make sure that we're streamlining, the process and allowing routine non substance substantive.",,,
442,0.8121918439865112,2055.9,2056.9, Is on the agenda.,,,
443,0.8121918439865112,2057.1,2059.9,I can understand why unanimous vote from a committee.,,,
444,0.8121918439865112,2060.4,2062.2,Would initially be in this list.,,,
445,0.8121918439865112,2062.3,2066.1,"I think my concern, though, is we all don't sit on every committee.",,,
446,0.8121918439865112,2066.1,2067.2,I won't know.,,,
447,0.8121918439865112,2067.2,2078.3,"For example, if I have a concern about a certain policy item, and given the importance of making sure that we're prepared for discussion deliberation.",,,
448,0.8121918439865112,2078.6,2081.8,It would make sense to me to have the policy items.,,,
449,0.8121918439865112,2081.8,2085.8,Not be considered considered routine and non steps and do I,,,
450,0.899056613445282,2085.9,2090.4, That's the sort of threshold that I was thinking about in terms of the consent calendar.,,,
451,0.899056613445282,2090.4,2101.9,"And so my preference still would be that policy related bills because we don't all sit on various committees, get the chance to have a final vote in full Council that make it on to the regular agenda.",,,
452,0.899056613445282,2101.9,2107.6,"So that there is a individual vote on those policy items, right?",,,
453,0.899056613445282,2107.6,2115.9,"And what I'm trying to share with you, is that the rule, that's not the rule, the rule is policy, bills do not go on the consent.",,,
454,0.906617283821106,2115.9,2116.6, Agenda.,,,
455,0.9089541435241699,2117.8,2122.3," The exception would be if yeah, the rule is no, we wouldn't do that.",,,
456,0.9089541435241699,2122.7,2125.9,"Okay, maybe I'm misreading the line, 22, Justin.",,,
457,0.9089541435241699,2126.1,2127.6,"Yeah, I think is it says vote on bills.",,,
458,0.9089541435241699,2127.6,2128.3,That's what the confusion.,,,
459,0.9089541435241699,2128.3,2141.3,"I understand exactly what you're saying, but that was never, the rule would be everything should go to counsel unless you have your regular basic garden-variety things that are, you know, standard payment of the bills.",,,
460,0.9089541435241699,2141.3,2147.4,"That there's not going to be any kind of issue or debate, but the rule would be anything with policy would be on the would be on the",,,
461,0.7938109040260315,2147.6,2148.8, Would be on the agenda.,,,
462,0.7938109040260315,2149.3,2150.8,"Okay, that's good to hear, Madam president.",,,
463,0.7938109040260315,2150.8,2166.5,"I think, in that case, I might suggest, maybe a clarifying amendment to online, 22 strike the word bills then because it may be confusing and and I appreciate your legislative intent being explained there.",,,
464,0.7938109040260315,2166.5,2177.4,I think you and I are in lockstep on that if that is the intent for policy bills to still have a discussion opportunity and full Council and not be subject to whether or not a chair.,,,
465,0.8171424269676208,2177.5,2178.0, Sides.,,,
466,0.8171424269676208,2178.0,2179.4,Whether it goes on the consent calendar.,,,
467,0.8171424269676208,2179.8,2181.1,"Yeah, then I think it was straightening.",,,
468,0.8171424269676208,2181.1,2183.4,The word bills would be sufficient.,,,
469,0.8171424269676208,2183.4,2184.3,So Madam clerk.,,,
470,0.8171424269676208,2184.3,2185.5,Do we need to?,,,
471,0.8171424269676208,2185.7,2187.9,Is there any is there anything else from Central staff or anybody?,,,
472,0.8171424269676208,2187.9,2190.2,So before I make a comment?,,,
473,0.8171424269676208,2190.2,2193.2,"I mean, yeah, I did want to provide some context at this point.",,,
474,0.8171424269676208,2193.2,2201.4,"We have not this office of city clerk and the council, president's office has not established a process for bills to be placed on the consent calendar, except for the payment of bills.",,,
475,0.8171424269676208,2201.7,2207.4,"Because the fact that a lot of bills require a specific number of council members to vote on,",,,
476,0.8423150777816772,2207.6,2215.3, Also requires five council members to vote on a bill sometimes six or seven and those those are obviously going to be your budget related bills.,,,
477,0.8423150777816772,2215.3,2216.7,I require higher threshold.,,,
478,0.8423150777816772,2216.9,2218.4,"So therefore, we have not implemented.",,,
479,0.8423150777816772,2218.4,2221.9,How Council bills little place on the city council agenda at this point.,,,
480,0.8423150777816772,2222.1,2233.0,"And so the way that this rule is written, is written in a way that is very broad, so that we can then we can then develop a mechanism on how, and which bills we would, determine that would be on a consent calendar.",,,
481,0.8423150777816772,2233.4,2237.1,"So, for instance, we could determine that only bills that relate to",,,
482,0.81513512134552,2238.0,2241.5, That's a acceptance of easements could be placed on a consent calendar.,,,
483,0.81513512134552,2241.5,2247.1,Then we could add that type of level of restrictive language in here.,,,
484,0.81513512134552,2247.1,2258.8,"If we wanted you to have a future and a future date, but we could work with that scope at the same time as we're trying to develop as to which types of legislation we do want on the actual consent calendar.",,,
485,0.81513512134552,2258.8,2262.1,And which ones we do not want on the consent calendar and a regular basis.,,,
486,0.8178861737251282,2263.4,2264.0, Thanks a million.,,,
487,0.8178861737251282,2264.0,2274.0,I would just I would just add this was meant to be Broad and not super prescriptive so they can be but they don't have to be placed and I would just use the example.,,,
488,0.8178861737251282,2274.2,2279.5,I think the select budget committee is a good example when the council is considering the annual budget adoption.,,,
489,0.8178861737251282,2279.5,2285.5,There's usually somewhere from between 25 and 35 bills that the committee considers.,,,
490,0.8178861737251282,2285.5,2292.3,But there's really three or four that are the focus of most discussion and debate at the final Council.,,,
491,0.7492535710334778,2292.7,2301.2," And the preceding 20 are sort of required to implement the final, the final bill that adopts adopts, the annual budget.",,,
492,0.7492535710334778,2301.3,2310.1,"I think in that case, it may be of interest to put some of those first 20 bills in a consent agenda.",,,
493,0.7492535710334778,2310.1,2318.9,And so I think how I had understood the conversations with the council president's office in the clerk's up to the state is that the practice would be moving forward.,,,
494,0.7492535710334778,2318.9,2322.5,That they would be placing bills any bill.,,,
495,0.8154151439666748,2322.6,2327.4," Will that hadn't been un unanimous vote, and no abstentions coming out of committee on the consent.",,,
496,0.8154151439666748,2327.4,2328.0,Agenda.,,,
497,0.8154151439666748,2328.2,2330.7,I'm hearing a different intent from the council president today.,,,
498,0.8154151439666748,2330.7,2341.1,"And so, I think what Amelia is suggesting is that there is nothing prescribing a certain practice on what gets placed or doesn't get placed on the consent agenda in this rule.",,,
499,0.8154151439666748,2341.1,2352.5,"It just allows for it and the council president could simply direct the the deputy clerks to not include any policy bills on the consent, agenda and nothing would have to change in the rule as",,,
500,0.9128385782241821,2353.0,2355.1, As described or as written.,,,
501,0.7554447650909424,2356.8,2358.1, All I'm on President's promise.,,,
502,0.7554447650909424,2358.1,2359.7,Gotta thank you very much.,,,
503,0.7554447650909424,2360.0,2361.3,I think council president.,,,
504,0.7554447650909424,2361.3,2367.1,The the description that you provided is in alignment with my desire as well.,,,
505,0.7554447650909424,2367.5,2369.4,I think to remove ambiguity.,,,
506,0.7554447650909424,2369.5,2376.7,We either strike the word bills or say payment of bills because I can understand why you each week.,,,
507,0.7554447650909424,2376.7,2378.5,We would have the payment of bills included there.,,,
508,0.7554447650909424,2378.5,2382.0,So maybe perhaps add payment of right before bills.,,,
509,0.7554447650909424,2382.6,2386.5,"I appreciate the discussion, but I also think that it does leave.",,,
510,0.9007788300514221,2386.7,2394.0," Ambiguity and want to make sure that we're all feeling really comfortable about a consent calendar, since it comes up at the top of the agenda.",,,
511,0.9007788300514221,2394.2,2395.4,It's voted on very quickly.,,,
512,0.9007788300514221,2395.4,2398.5,We all want to feel comfortable with what's included in that package.,,,
513,0.9007788300514221,2398.5,2412.5,"So Madam president, I appreciate the legislative intent as you articulated in my preference would either be to strike bills or to add payment of before bills and apologies for doing this on a screen, but I know it is not ideal.",,,
514,0.9007788300514221,2412.6,2413.4,You can do it.,,,
515,0.9007788300514221,2413.4,2414.2,So thank you.,,,
516,0.9007788300514221,2414.5,2416.5,I would strongly discourage.,,,
517,0.9062647223472595,2416.6,2423.2, Courage amendments on the Fly because I don't think those changes are actually reflecting what your intent is to councilmember mosquito with with all due.,,,
518,0.9062647223472595,2423.2,2427.4,"Respect payment of bills is is a separate item, goes directly to a full Council.",,,
519,0.9062647223472595,2427.4,2435.0,"So, I think we need to massage this section related to committee reports and clarify.",,,
520,0.9062647223472595,2435.0,2442.1,"And maybe it is, is just striking bills, but there may be some bills that come out of committee that you may want to include on a consent agenda.",,,
521,0.9062647223472595,2442.5,2446.3,So what I would recommend is to provide direction to me.,,,
522,0.7401867508888245,2446.8,2465.8," And Amelia to work on a modification to reflect the intent described today for consideration at full Council, but I'm not certain that the on-the-fly changes describe today will will accurately Implement your intent councilmember Mesquita and council president was right.",,,
523,0.7401867508888245,2465.8,2469.0,And let me just share this and Casper was gay.,,,
524,0.7401867508888245,2469.0,2472.2,"I understand what you're saying, but I it's not ambiguous to me.",,,
525,0.7401867508888245,2472.2,2473.4,But let me just share this.,,,
526,0.7401867508888245,2474.2,2476.5,It is meant to be General and,,,
527,0.7651035785675049,2476.6,2477.3, Incense.,,,
528,0.7651035785675049,2477.3,2486.6,"No one was going to put in a consent calendar, a bill in which they're still existing or policy questions.",,,
529,0.7651035785675049,2488.0,2495.0,"It's your basic, you know, somebody's in committee and there were two easements and it passed committee.",,,
530,0.7651035785675049,2495.0,2505.7,"There wasn't any, you know, dispute of em, I would let the committee chair tell me and but, you know, I'm trying to give people a little bit more room to to have some",,,
531,0.7839992046356201,2506.6,2510.0, Question and to work with the council president's office in the clerks.,,,
532,0.7839992046356201,2510.0,2523.2,"And as I said, it isn't a hard and fast rule that, you know, they're a bunch of bills are going to show up in the consent calendar, where the full city council wouldn't have an opportunity to discuss them or there wouldn't be.",,,
533,0.7839992046356201,2523.7,2533.0,"You wouldn't be put in a position where if something was on the consent that before we move forward that you ask something be pulled off the consent, that would be done.",,,
534,0.7839992046356201,2533.0,2536.4,"Well before the agenda is printed, that's what we do.",,,
535,0.9128386378288269,2537.2,2545.4, But if you believe that we need more time to Wordsmith or massage vote on bills.,,,
536,0.9128386378288269,2545.7,2546.9,We can certainly do that.,,,
537,0.7832402586936951,2549.3,2550.2, It's not a president.,,,
538,0.7832402586936951,2551.5,2553.4,I would also offer that.,,,
539,0.7832402586936951,2553.4,2576.7,"I think some things that maybe seem routine in some of those bills like an acceptance of easement and I don't want to speak for any of the other council members on this line here, but even some of those things can have questions Associated and I would want to make sure that council members are prepared for the discussion on policy related items, without having something, possibly pulled that day.",,,
540,0.7832402586936951,2577.3,2579.0,"And I think that if there was a heart, a heart",,,
541,0.859040379524231,2579.1,2586.4," Roll not a broad interpretation of what bills meant, if there was a hard roll that all of the bills are not going to be included in the consent, calendar.",,,
542,0.859040379524231,2586.8,2593.9,"All of us, no matter which committee we sat on then have the chance to look at each of those policy bills and know that what we're making a final vote on.",,,
543,0.859040379524231,2594.8,2601.1,"I think that that's still accomplish, has your goal of making our our shared goal of making this more streamlined.",,,
544,0.859040379524231,2601.4,2608.9,"And again, I think that when our team had heard that the final vote was in May, unfortunately, I thought that that meant that I had a few more weeks.",,,
545,0.7844369411468506,2609.1,2610.0, I have this discussion.,,,
546,0.7844369411468506,2610.0,2611.8,And so I don't want to delay this.,,,
547,0.7844369411468506,2611.8,2618.0,I think that this is pretty routine if you will and do you think that we can move forward?,,,
548,0.7844369411468506,2618.0,2624.3,"But if if you madam president prefer for there to be an amendment in full Council, that's fine.",,,
549,0.7844369411468506,2624.5,2628.7,I just think that striking the word bills is probably the easiest way to get go about it.,,,
550,0.7844369411468506,2628.9,2638.3,"Happy to work with you and Central staff, in the meantime, but also don't want this to become a debate in full Council, if what we have is the shared intent here.",,,
551,0.8809512257575989,2641.3,2647.1," Ellie's anything you want to add or Madam chair council, president Juarez.",,,
552,0.8809512257575989,2647.2,2661.8,"I think what I'm hearing is a verbal Amendment proposed by councilmember Mesquita to strike the word bills from Lion, 22 or eat, you know, the second sentence.",,,
553,0.8809512257575989,2661.8,2662.6,I'm trying to do this.,,,
554,0.8809512257575989,2662.6,2671.0,"So Amelia says, it's correct in the second sentence of section e in the rules, I don't that's why not right?",,,
555,0.8206376433372498,2671.1,2673.1," Millia, but the word bills.",,,
556,0.8206376433372498,2673.1,2675.9,"Highlighted on the screen, strike it from the resolution.",,,
557,0.8206376433372498,2675.9,2677.6,Is that correct?,,,
558,0.8206376433372498,2677.6,2678.0,Yes.,,,
559,0.8206376433372498,2678.8,2679.2,Lines.,,,
560,0.8206376433372498,2679.2,2679.7,What is that?,,,
561,0.8206376433372498,2679.7,2681.5,I would only do this at this point.,,,
562,0.8206376433372498,2681.5,2683.7,If this is something that you would be else's supportive.,,,
563,0.8206376433372498,2683.7,2687.4,"Oh, well, you know, it's kind of it.",,,
564,0.8206376433372498,2687.9,2692.3,"Well, we can do that if you want to, but it's pretty General.",,,
565,0.8206376433372498,2692.3,2694.4,It isn't going to stop any policy debate.,,,
566,0.8206376433372498,2694.4,2699.5,"But if that's the Comfort level, you need, then we can, we can do, can we do a friendly Amendment Madam clerk?",,,
567,0.8206376433372498,2699.5,2700.2,"I know, Ellie.",,,
568,0.8206376433372498,2700.2,2701.0,How do you feel about that?,,,
569,0.7524246573448181,2701.1,2706.8," That and doing this now, but before we go on let me let me hold up a minute.",,,
570,0.7524246573448181,2706.8,2707.8,Here comes my mascara.,,,
571,0.7524246573448181,2707.8,2710.4,I'm going to bounce back over to calc reputational cuz that's good.,,,

574,0.7695046663284302,2714.4,2716.6,I really appreciate this discussion.,,,
575,0.7695046663284302,2716.6,2726.5,"And I definitely see where counselor Miss Kane is coming from and and I think that, you know, it's potentially an incremental, the good news.",,,
576,0.7695046663284302,2726.5,2732.1,"Is that even if we were to strike the word bills, it's still an incremental Improvement in terms of streamlining stuff.",,,
577,0.7695046663284302,2733.0,2735.4,So happy to hear the rest of the discussion.,,,
578,0.7695046663284302,2735.4,2742.6,I did have a clarifying question if where it says that upon request.,,,
579,0.9105430841445923,2742.8,2747.1, Any cm and item shall be removed.,,,
580,0.9105430841445923,2747.3,2749.5,I just want to clarify from the clerk's.,,,
581,0.9105430841445923,2749.5,2752.4,Does that require a second?,,,
582,0.9128383994102478,2754.2,2760.6," And and this, the other question is, is that a request where it says upon request by any CM.",,,
583,0.9128383994102478,2760.9,2765.0,Does that have to be made at the city council committee meeting?,,,
584,0.9128383994102478,2765.0,2766.2,Or can it be made?,,,
585,0.8651928901672363,2767.4,2789.3," You know, can an email be sent or a discussion had or whatever, or do we have to wait till the full council meeting and then make a public request at that moment in time Absalom ever Peter said, and there are two opportunities when a council member can request that an item be removed, from the consent, calendar on Thursdays.",,,
586,0.8651928901672363,2789.3,2795.1,We develop a preliminary agenda and that preliminary agenda will include items on the consent calendar.,,,
587,0.8651928901672363,2795.1,2797.0,If there's an item on there that accounts my word.,,,
588,0.9020382165908813,2797.4,2798.4, For it to be removed.,,,
589,0.9020382165908813,2798.4,2804.2,There's an opportunity for that cast member to make requests for it to be removed before we publish the final agenda.,,,
590,0.9020382165908813,2804.5,2811.6,"And we publish a final agenda again on Mondays, before, 2 p.m. To meet that 24 hours in advance deadline.",,,
591,0.9020382165908813,2811.9,2824.7,"Now again, if the council members miss those opportunities, the second opportunity to be at the specific city council meeting where the items being considered where it councilmember can simply make a request at the Ina, be removed from the consent calendar.",,,
592,0.9020382165908813,2824.7,2826.9,"Once it's removed, its",,,
593,0.8834986686706543,2827.1,2833.7, Then sent to the section specifically dedicated for items removed from the consent calendar on the agenda.,,,
594,0.8834986686706543,2834.9,2837.9,So specifically you can send an email.,,,
595,0.8834986686706543,2837.9,2840.7,When you see the draft the preliminary agenda.,,,
596,0.8834986686706543,2840.7,2845.7,You can send an email before that if you just want to be sure and item doesn't get placed on the consent agenda.,,,
597,0.8834986686706543,2845.7,2853.6,"So the clerk's understand or if you make the request at full Council, if a council member request an item to be removed, it will just be removed.",,,
598,0.8834986686706543,2853.7,2856.2,It's the same practice we use in the select budget committee.,,,
599,0.8834986686706543,2856.2,2857.0,I believe it would not,,,
600,0.7242140173912048,2857.2,2858.8, Fire a second and a vote.,,,
601,0.7242140173912048,2859.3,2862.4,"It would just be removed without any votes, correct?",,,
602,0.7242140173912048,2862.4,2863.4,"Yeah, correct.",,,
603,0.7242140173912048,2863.4,2868.8,And then in addition I just wanted to clarify that the chair of the specific committee as well.,,,
604,0.7242140173912048,2868.8,2877.8,Just to restate can make the request specifically after the committee meeting to not place any of the items on the consent calendar or only specific items on the consent calendar.,,,
605,0.7242140173912048,2878.0,2881.0,So there's also that opportunity so that makes it three opportunities as well.,,,
606,0.7242140173912048,2881.8,2882.1,Right?,,,
607,0.7242140173912048,2882.1,2887.0,"And the general rule is, it's not a parliamentary procedure to it's not a big deal.",,,
608,0.7765021920204163,2887.1,2889.2," Deal to say, oh, I did catch it.",,,
609,0.7765021920204163,2889.6,2901.1,"I see something is on the consent calendar and basically, what we've been doing is when people like, I gave customer else's an example where she did catch one of her appointments and just let me know.",,,
610,0.7765021920204163,2901.1,2904.6,"And in the president's introduction, the chairs report.",,,
611,0.7765021920204163,2904.7,2908.3,"I just said, I understand customer else wants to pull item number 8, and that's it.",,,
612,0.7765021920204163,2908.3,2909.7,It's really not a lot to it.,,,
613,0.7765021920204163,2910.2,2911.7,You all get the agenda ahead of time.,,,
614,0.7765021920204163,2911.7,2916.8,"So, you know exactly what matters are on there and we all peruse them and look at it and look at amendments.",,,
615,0.7765021920204163,2916.8,2917.0,What?,,,
616,0.906327486038208,2917.1,2919.9," On there, and you can just it's very informal.",,,
617,0.906327486038208,2919.9,2920.6,That's all it is.,,,
618,0.906327486038208,2920.6,2927.4,It isn't a matter of taking important policy issues and tucking them in the consent calendar and getting them in front of full Council.,,,
619,0.906327486038208,2927.4,2929.6,Where somebody may have more issues to add.,,,
620,0.906327486038208,2929.6,2935.0,"I don't, I don't foresee that as a tool for particularly, obviously, for policy issues.",,,
621,0.906327486038208,2935.0,2943.8,"It's basically as general as possible and as flexible as possible and three opportunities to just tell us, you don't want it in the consent.",,,
622,0.906327486038208,2943.8,2946.8,"And also, just to let us know as we're speaking.",,,
623,0.7585639357566833,2947.1,2949.4, Him and I can do it or the councilmember can do it.,,,
624,0.7585639357566833,2949.4,2951.3,It's really that easy of a tool.,,,
625,0.7585639357566833,2952.5,2956.3,"So, I mean, it just seems pretty straightforward to me, but",,,
626,0.7995220422744751,2958.3,2959.0, That's where we're at.,,,
627,0.7995220422744751,2959.0,2961.6,So we want to do because our mosquito.,,,
628,0.7995220422744751,2961.6,2965.5,Is it your intent then that you want to do a friendly Amendment right here?,,,
629,0.7995220422744751,2965.9,2967.7,And just take out bills.,,,
630,0.7995220422744751,2967.7,2968.6,Is that possible?,,,
631,0.7995220422744751,2968.6,2970.2,"Madam clerk, Miss Sanchez?",,,
632,0.8691567182540894,2972.0,2972.7, Is that a picture?,,,
633,0.8691567182540894,2972.7,2974.8,If the truck stops in oral Amendment?,,,
634,0.8691567182540894,2974.8,2975.0,Then?,,,
635,0.8691567182540894,2975.0,2976.0,"Yes, we can proceed.",,,
636,0.8691567182540894,2976.4,2977.8,"Okay, Ellie.",,,
637,0.8691567182540894,2977.8,2984.8,Is it is that going to be an issue if it just is a level of comfort for councilmember most data to have boat on bills removed?,,,
638,0.8691567182540894,2986.2,2994.2,Because my understanding is even if you take out vote on bills committee chair can still put that in there.,,,
639,0.8691567182540894,2994.2,2995.6,If it's if it right?,,,
640,0.8691567182540894,2995.7,3000.0,It's not going to it's not going to stop anyone from moving forward.,,,
641,0.8691567182540894,3000.0,3001.7,If the if indeed they want to do that.,,,
642,0.8230480551719666,3003.6,3004.2, Correct.,,,
643,0.8230480551719666,3004.2,3004.7,All right.,,,
644,0.8230480551719666,3005.1,3005.5,"Okay, see.",,,
645,0.8230480551719666,3005.5,3007.0,So we can still do it.,,,
646,0.8230480551719666,3007.0,3008.0,We can take that out.,,,
647,0.8230480551719666,3008.0,3013.2,If people are concerned about that it you still have the opportunity as a committee chair.,,,
648,0.8230480551719666,3013.8,3014.9,If something like that.,,,
649,0.8230480551719666,3014.9,3018.7,"You wanted on the consent calendar that we can do it, correct?",,,
650,0.8713839054107666,3019.7,3026.6," Okay, and their act councilmember would have the opportunity if they wanted to, to go through the process of removing an item as you just described as well.",,,

652,0.8713839054107666,3028.0,3031.7,"I think that that makes me more comfortable, you know, for example of myself.",,,
653,0.8713839054107666,3031.7,3040.9,I'll probably still recommend that the payment of bills be considered as part of the consent calendar the you know half dozen items that Ali mentioned that are routine when it comes to budget.,,,
654,0.8713839054107666,3041.0,3043.5,I'll probably still recommend become part of the consent calendar.,,,
655,0.8713839054107666,3044.4,3049.4,"It's at full Council, but I think that this really allows for us to be prepared and know that these",,,
656,0.9128382205963135,3049.5,3053.5, We'll see bills for the most part are going at the routine.,,,
657,0.9128382205963135,3053.5,3057.8,"The expectation would be that they're going to have their individual vote, almost like a floor vote.",,,
658,0.9128382205963135,3057.8,3060.2,And then that will be the final passage.,,,
659,0.9128382205963135,3060.6,3067.2,Thank you for your willingness to accept that because I think it does align with what your intent was as well and just makes it clear.,,,

686,0.760970950126648,3144.5,3151.9,So the amended version of the rules adopted in December of 2021 included a change to allow obsessive tensions on resolutions.,,,

688,0.760970950126648,3157.3,3162.9,Prior to that council members were required to vote on all actions except those where they had a conflict.,,,
689,0.8896481394767761,3163.4,3173.0, Resolution 3205 one would modify that rule to relieve the council president from making that determination on which resolution to councilmember May abstain from voting on.,,,
690,0.8896481394767761,3173.0,3177.5,It would allow council members to abstain from a vote on a resolution.,,,
691,0.8896481394767761,3177.5,3187.2,"If the resolution is related to topics that may be of concern to Seattle residents, but the topics involved jurisdictions or matters not under the city's Direct.",,,

694,0.7843098044395447,3198.5,3211.5,And it would require that when a councilmember wishes to abstain from a vote that the council member announced their intent that they are invoking their right to have abstained prior to the vote being called on that resolution.,,,
695,0.7843098044395447,3211.7,3217.9,That is necessary to provide an opportunity of any council member objects to the intent to abstain.,,,
696,0.7843098044395447,3217.9,3223.2,"So, that would be if a council member believes the resolution is related to the",,,

702,0.843332827091217,3257.9,3265.4,If this rule was in place part of the purpose of that exercise was to determine like how much debate could there be.,,,
703,0.843332827091217,3265.8,3283.2,"There's always going to be some gray area, but I think the rule as written will provide greater Clarity on which resolutions could or could not be abstain from there's additional background information in the memo that I wasn't going to walk through today, but it's available for",,,

731,0.7707469463348389,3366.2,3370.6,I believe that the amendment from counselor mascara was a last-minute addition.,,,

756,0.8123800158500671,3470.8,3472.7,And then I have some discussion as well though.,,,
757,0.8123800158500671,3473.0,3479.8,"Okay, so councilmember mosquitoes second councilmember Peterson's first amendment.",,,
758,0.8123800158500671,3479.8,3482.1,So cashner Peterson is sponsor of this amendment.,,,
759,0.8123800158500671,3482.1,3484.0,You were recognized in order to address it.,,,
760,0.8123800158500671,3485.1,3489.3,Thank you council president and thanks for being able to discuss this.,,,
761,0.8123800158500671,3489.5,3496.9,I want to thank our Central staff and city clerk's for their ongoing research and expertise on these issues.,,,
762,0.9023037552833557,3497.0,3502.3," Colleagues, a good news is that the council rules that we adopted at the start of this year.",,,
763,0.9023037552833557,3502.3,3511.6,"Already formalize, the concept of extensions at full City, Council meetings on a subset of resolutions and not materially related to city government.",,,
764,0.9023037552833557,3511.6,3512.7,And today.,,,
765,0.9023037552833557,3512.7,3524.2,"We simply have a couple of options to refine that rule to improve the Practical implementation of the abstention concept, which would still be for just a subset of resolutions.",,,
766,0.9023037552833557,3524.2,3526.7,"Yes, or no votes obviously still.",,,
767,0.7946689128875732,3527.0,3528.5, Acquired for Council bills.,,,
768,0.7946689128875732,3528.9,3545.2,"So rather than re-litigating, the general merits of abstentions for Resolutions, which, which are already standard for Robert's Rules of Order already allowed in our committee meetings and already a standard option for independently elected officials and several other Washington cities and Across the Nation.",,,
769,0.7946689128875732,3545.2,3547.9,I'll address the specifics of my proposed amendment here.,,,
770,0.7946689128875732,3548.2,3552.4,"Let me start by saying, I already support the resolution before us today.",,,
771,0.7946689128875732,3553.3,3556.9,So my amendment to that resolution would however allow,,,
772,0.9078419804573059,3556.9,3563.6, For additional flexibility and instances to abstain on resolutions at full City Council meetings.,,,
773,0.9078419804573059,3563.6,3569.6,"The current resolution says, abstentions are not allowed on resolutions related to city government.",,,
774,0.9078419804573059,3569.6,3581.0,Whereas my Amendment says abstentions would not be allowed on resolutions directly affecting city government and as our Central staff pointed out in the memo and would be great.,,,
775,0.9078419804573059,3581.0,3586.9,"If we heard more from them on this, using the words directly affecting is likely.",,,
776,0.694273829460144,3586.9,3592.7," Lee to capture more resolution, so that we, as independently elected officials can choose.",,,
777,0.694273829460144,3592.7,3601.9,"We have the choice rather to abstain it's between us and our constituents, whether we choose to take that option rather than not having a choice at all.",,,
778,0.694273829460144,3602.2,3606.4,So thank you colleagues for consideration of this additional option before us.,,,
779,0.694273829460144,3607.1,3609.5,Thank you before I say anything.,,,
780,0.694273829460144,3609.5,3616.9,Is there anyone who would like to respond to councilmember Peterson's Amendment which would add the language?,,,
781,0.6854156851768494,3616.9,3622.4, Which directly affecting the administration of city government regarding abstentions councilmember scada?,,,
782,0.8157488107681274,3625.1,3630.2," This is a fun discussion because again, I was thinking that this was just for discussion today.",,,
783,0.8157488107681274,3630.2,3635.9,"So again, apologies, Captain Peterson that I didn't have the chance to connect with you on your Amendment here.",,,
784,0.8157488107681274,3636.8,3642.7,"So I'm going to say something that might be, might be something folks are hearing from me for the first time.",,,
785,0.8157488107681274,3643.1,3650.0,"You know, I don't actually have a concern when it comes to resolutions, if council members are choosing to abstain.",,,
786,0.8157488107681274,3650.6,3654.8,I think that the concern that I have with our process or what's being proposed right now.,,,
787,0.8433632850646973,3655.0,3669.5," Now, is that it sort of puts somebody in a position to have to defend, why they're abstaining and by determining whether or not something is either related to city government or directly affecting city government.",,,
788,0.8433632850646973,3669.7,3673.4,I think one is still in the position of having to explain their abstention.,,,
789,0.8433632850646973,3673.8,3675.2,If for whatever reason.,,,
790,0.8433632850646973,3675.3,3682.6,"If it's, you know, lack of ability to dig into a topic that might not be within their purview or something else.",,,
791,0.8433632850646973,3682.9,3684.4,"If, if we're confining",,,
792,0.9128388166427612,3684.9,3687.3, Actions to resolutions period.,,,
793,0.9128388166427612,3687.8,3689.2,I don't have a concern with that.,,,
794,0.9128388166427612,3689.2,3694.0,The concern again is more like having to justify their upset abstention.,,,
795,0.9128388166427612,3694.5,3703.4,"So one of the things that I'd be interested in and council president, you know, would love to hear more about what your legislative intent or vision is here as well.",,,
796,0.9128388166427612,3703.8,3710.9,But one of the things that I was interested in is is basically just codified in codifying that last sentence.,,,
797,0.9128388166427612,3711.0,3714.8,Any councilmember wishing to abstain is needs to announce that there.,,,
798,0.9024997353553772,3714.9,3734.4," I'll get the right to abstain and then they abstain versus having to sort of go through a Rubik of determining whether or not something is connected to City business, whether related to or directly affecting, and thus, I think allowing for us to more swiftly move through resolution votes without folks, again having to justify their abstention.",,,
799,0.9024997353553772,3734.5,3741.2,"Okay, it's less of a proposed amendment and more appoint of hopefully discussion to see if that.",,,
800,0.9024997353553772,3741.2,3743.9,Child has also may be in line with where others might be.,,,
801,0.9024997353553772,3743.9,3744.7,If there's the,,,
802,0.8924623727798462,3744.9,3746.2, Fire to abstain.,,,
803,0.8924623727798462,3746.5,3747.5,I think that that's fine.,,,
804,0.8924623727798462,3747.5,3753.4,"If it's, if it's scope to just resolutions and thus that final sentence.",,,
805,0.8924623727798462,3754.2,3754.8,Great.,,,
806,0.8924623727798462,3754.8,3760.4,"So, I'm going to say why I'm not supporting this and it gets to what you have said, counselor mosquito.",,,
807,0.8924623727798462,3760.9,3763.7,"So, let's go back in the time machine here.",,,
808,0.8924623727798462,3763.7,3766.1,I was never comfortable with our original.,,,
809,0.8924623727798462,3766.1,3774.7,"I understand why president Gonzalez did the, what she needed to do with the word, not materially related to city government, because that put the",,,

813,0.7356539964675903,3798.2,3804.1,We worked with Allie and her staff in the clerks and came up with the general.,,,

820,0.7741416096687317,3827.6,3834.8,"And if you have a chance to look at them because I went through them and kind of circled which ones you could have stayed on and you know, some of them, you know, I",,,
821,0.9003575444221497,3834.9,3836.8, See why we give a good example.,,,
822,0.9003575444221497,3836.8,3849.2,One of the ones that you could have stayed on was a resolution that I proposed where this I wanted the Seattle City council to oppose or look into or support tribal nations in regards to boarding schools.,,,
823,0.9003575444221497,3849.2,3854.2,"And technically, you don't have to vote on that.",,,
824,0.9003575444221497,3854.2,3861.5,"But we did, and if you didn't want to, you didn't have to, I'll tell you the problem that I have with councilmember Peterson's amendment.",,,

828,0.8861843943595886,3872.0,3882.5,"I think it, I think it gets too much power to the council president and discretion and I think it just opens up a Pandora's Box and adding this qualifier where then someone's going to argue.",,,

869,0.9128382802009583,4060.1,4062.1,What's directly related.,,,
870,0.9128382802009583,4062.1,4063.1,I'm not going to do that.,,,
871,0.9128382802009583,4063.5,4066.8,I think you should just have the opportunity to abstain and I want it.,,,
872,0.9128382802009583,4066.8,4068.1,I really wanted that clean.,,,
873,0.9128382802009583,4068.6,4071.0,So I'm done with my speech customers gator.,,,

875,0.9011938571929932,4073.4,4081.6,I think that you and I are saying the same thing and I also don't want you or any other person in that position to have to make that decision.,,,
876,0.9011938571929932,4082.0,4087.1,I also think that it is may be in alignment with the legislative intent as originally written.,,,
877,0.9011938571929932,4087.1,4092.3,And as council member Peterson is trying to massage here and wonder of council member Petersen.,,,
878,0.9011938571929932,4092.3,4099.3,If you might be interested in a friendly amendment to put a period in the first line after resolutions.,,,
879,0.902795135974884,4099.7,4102.6, Strike everything through any councilmember.,,,
880,0.902795135974884,4102.6,4103.7,Not that last line.,,,
881,0.902795135974884,4103.7,4122.2,Any councilmember wishing to abstain would still announced and so that is I think Madam president a way to possibly still allow for somebody to announce that they're going to be of standing without having to justify it.,,,
882,0.902795135974884,4122.2,4129.4,And also doesn't put the council president in a position to have to determine what is related to or what is directly affecting the city.,,,
883,0.8334771990776062,4129.7,4134.5," Asian, it just simply says, a council member has the right to use this on resolution specifically.",,,
884,0.7643965482711792,4135.9,4140.2, I'm going to live a lie and the clerk respond because there's some issues here before we go to Casper Peterson.,,,

886,0.7643965482711792,4151.3,4155.2,And so it would just allow extensions on any resolution.,,,
887,0.7643965482711792,4155.6,4165.0,"It would require that a councilmember still announced their intent to abstain and then the existing language that if you don't abstain, you have to vote.",,,

889,0.7559711337089539,4170.5,4174.7,I think that in terms of having gray area or not.,,,
890,0.7559711337089539,4174.7,4181.8,"That would that this is the simplest application of when a councilmember may or may not abstain, there may be certain resolutions.",,,

895,0.8892320990562439,4222.6,4229.3,So basically counselor most Gaeta wants to amend councilmember Peterson's Amendment.,,,
896,0.8892320990562439,4229.5,4235.9,"So with that and you've highlighted where council members Gator would like that part gone, correct?",,,
897,0.8386452198028564,4237.4,4238.0, Correct.,,,
898,0.8386452198028564,4238.2,4239.6,"Okay, because we're Peterson.",,,

904,0.8386452198028564,4251.6,4266.4,"So can you then now Madam Clerk or a lie, then just read what we would be amending it to for those who are listening, who maybe can't see the the the text in front of us.",,,
905,0.7615152597427368,4268.4,4269.9," Yes, so I'm going to.",,,
906,0.7615152597427368,4270.9,4283.3,"So the existing rules read abstentions are not allowed on actions other than resolutions that in the sole discretion of the council, president are not materially related to city government.",,,
907,0.7615152597427368,4283.8,4285.5,So that language would,,,

918,0.7667823433876038,4351.5,4355.5," If the rule is just, you are allowed to abstain on resolutions.",,,

921,0.7667823433876038,4367.8,4370.0,This would be really not debatable.,,,
922,0.7667823433876038,4370.0,4375.8,You can you may abstain from any resolution and so I actually would,,,
923,0.8948361277580261,4377.1,4400.7," Suggest that you strike more, you strike all the proposed language included in the in the resolution as introduced as well, as the amendatory language, in just strike that that in the sole discretion of the council president or not materially related to city government and keep the last sentence that's already existing in the rules.",,,
