35,0.97,238.171,282.782,"My comment is that Seattle city light has presented you with a strategic plan that fails to address adequately the needs of the city to respond to its ongoing climate change that we are all Unfortunately experiencing: I want to point out that when the 2018Irp, integrated resource plan was Prentded to the city council by Seattle city light, the first two bullet points and in the executive summary of its report focused on conservation and the importance of energy efficiency investments and the building stock of our city and how that would create the equivalent of a new power generation plant.",7,,
36,0.97,282.782,306.339,"In fact, in the second item that they say there, conservation investment remains the first and best resource choice as the most environmentally responsible way to meet the Washington energy independence act needs and enable city lights and Bonneville power authority higher generation to displace fossil fuel generation impacts by others in the region.",7,,
37,0.97,306.339,326.559,"However, I would like you to turn to page eight of the financial forecast Appendix they have provided you with and is attached to the agenda: This does not project any increase in spending for conservation over the four-year period.",7,,
38,0.97,326.559,348.214,"Rather, by having a flat amount which increases by less than 1% each year it is essentially decreasing because city light itself acknowledges that it is trying to build into this plan a 3% per year inflation rate.",7,,
39,0.97,348.214,353.486,The city lights strategic plan in other places in the document forecast an even higher inflation rate.,7,,
40,0.97,353.486,354.187,"Thank you, Mr. Ruby.",8,,

45,0.97,375.975,381.547,We would like to thank for parking rates for events.,9,,
46,0.97,381.547,390.256,Climate pledge arena strongly supports the proposal to increase event rates to $12 higher and to expand the Rpz in uptown.,9,,
47,0.97,390.256,393.359,We also support this rate adjustment extending to Sundays and holidays.,9,,
48,0.97,393.359,397.864,The proposed plan balances out some critical public policy objectives.,9,,

50,0.97,406.973,415.181,Increasing On-Street parking rates will help reduce congestion by reducing the number of people that will drive to the neighborhood and Hunt for On-Street parking.,9,,
51,0.97,415.181,426.092,"In addition, making Street parking rates comparable to garage rates will encourage those who drive to use climate pledge arena's parking reservation system to secure a spot before they arrive.",9,,
52,0.97,426.092,438.871,"At climate pledge arena, we're striving to be a good neighbor, not just to our fellow Seattle resident organizations but also to our surrounding neighborhoods in Queen Anne, uptown and others.",9,,
53,0.97,438.871,449.282,"That's why supporting this legislation, we're working to make sure more arena attendees take public transit, bike swath and use other options other than driving to get to our arena events.",9,,
54,0.97,449.282,459.926,We attended several community outreach meetings on this topic and think the city did a good job of reaching out to both businesses and residents about the impacts of these parking changes.,9,,
55,0.97,459.926,462.895,Like uptown alliance believes the Council should adopt the legislation.,9,,

64,0.97,519.185,523.589,Hello.,12,,
65,0.97,523.589,524.09,This is David Strauss.,12,,
66,0.97,524.09,545.311,"I'm speaking about Cb120-103 regarding the Georgetown steam plan, starting off with the importance of the Georgetown steam plant, it's a national landmark, it's a Seattle landmark based on the fact of its innovative construction, it's associated with an important figure, Frank Gilbreath.",12,,
67,0.97,545.311,552.585,"It's an important part of Seattle's history and really an important part of the urban context, especially in Georgetown.",12,,
68,0.97,552.585,558.891,"Landmarks are most instructive when they're in use, and the use proposed by the community development authority is ideal.",12,,
69,0.97,558.891,565.998,"Monthly tours, in addition to occasional events have been effective in teaching technology history, but to only a few people.",12,,
70,0.97,565.998,570.102,"So the CBA is proposing science, technology, engineering, arts and math instruction.",12,,
71,0.97,570.102,580.68,"So the project is going to open the steam plant to a much greater number of people, including younger members of the community as a place for science, technology, engineering, arts and math education.",12,,
72,0.97,580.68,589.221,"It's also going to open up to an increasing number of events, so really exposing the steam plant to do a greater public.",12,,

83,0.97,624.056,624.357,Thank you.,15,,
84,0.97,624.357,627.727,"Good morning, my name is Roseo Medina.",15,,
85,0.97,627.727,633.733,"I'm a Georgetown resident, and I would like to echo everything that David Strauss just said.",15,,
86,0.97,633.733,675.074,"We are in support of the ordinance to authorize the chief executive officer and general manager to execute a long-term lease and operating agreement for the Georgetown steam plant which would incorporate community development and historically the Georgetown community has not had much access or community connection to the historic site with this new vision of incorporating science, opening the doors, having events with the community and for the community and for the broader people who are also interested in the history of Georgetown and the people and this amazing landmark.",15,,
87,0.97,675.074,690.623,"We are in support of that, and this would also provide opportunities for our youth to learn about the history and their community and to continue sharing that and having a role.",15,,
88,0.97,690.623,697.53,"So this brings very many opportunities that the Georgetown community has not had in a very, very long time.",15,,
89,0.97,697.53,702.902,And I'm in support of this ordinance.,15,,
90,0.97,702.902,703.202,Thank you.,15,,
91,0.97,703.202,705.104,Thank you.,16,,
92,0.97,705.104,711.243,"Next we'll hear from Debra Frawstone, followed by Cindy laws.",16,,
93,0.97,711.243,712.344,"Go ahead, Debra.",16,,
94,0.97,712.344,712.711,Hello.,17,,
95,0.97,712.711,722.054,"Hello, my name is Debra Frosto, I have lived in uptown over 15 years and served uptown alliance committee chair on arena issues.",17,,
96,0.97,722.054,725.491,We are in support of recommendations in changes to the parking rate structure.,17,,
97,0.97,725.491,734.9,Transportation and parking have been at the core of so many countless guests over the last three years as we get ready for the new planet pledge arena.,17,,
98,0.97,734.9,741.974,We want to thank Sdot [inaudible] engaging with us and more broadly in our community in developing this parking legislation.,17,,
99,0.97,741.974,750.883,"So today, as you consider the recommendation, we would like you to know that uptown alliance promotes a progressive rate structure, even as high as $12 an hour.",17,,
100,0.97,750.883,760.226,"We also support extending event rates to include holidays and Sundays, days when there will certainly be many events going on at the arena.",17,,
101,0.97,760.226,761.293,Progressive rates can be confusing.,17,,
102,0.97,761.293,773.773,It's easy to be concerned if you think that someone who pays for two hours for a 6:30 dinner reservation might pay $16 or $24 in parking when in fact that's not how it works.,17,,
103,0.97,773.773,777.209,That person would pay closer to $6.,17,,
104,0.97,777.209,800.599,"Instead, we believe the concern should be that if we do not have higher event rates, then the parking on the street will be so attractive to arena event Goers that they will choose to look for curbside parking instead of looking at one of the garages, leaving no Swaths open for those who just want to go out, grab a coffee, go to a restaurant or shop at the market.",17,,
105,0.97,800.599,813.345,"Uptown alliance believes is that what we're suggesting is a balance to our residents, small businesses and the tens of thousands of event Goers and deserves your support.",17,,
106,0.97,813.345,813.646,Thank you.,17,,
107,0.97,813.646,814.547,"Thank you, Debra.",18,,
108,0.97,814.547,816.415,Our last Speaker is Cindy laws.,18,,
109,0.97,816.415,817.716,We tried her earlier.,18,,

111,0.97,819.552,830.162,"Cindy, if you can hear us, press Star 6 and go ahead.",18,,
112,0.97,830.162,844.376,"Cindy, if you don't mind sending us--if you're not able to press Star 6 and speak now please do send us an Email to Council @ Seattle.Gov.",18,,
113,0.97,844.376,845.211,It'll reach all nine Councilmembers.,18,,
114,0.97,845.211,845.444,Cindy?,18,,
115,0.97,845.444,846.145,Can you hear me now?,19,,
116,0.97,846.145,849.481,"Yes, we can hear you.",20,,
117,0.97,849.481,849.715,Yes.,21,,
118,0.97,849.715,854.42,I think I pushed Star 6 about 12 times.,21,,
119,0.97,854.42,855.621,Sorry about that.,21,,
120,0.97,855.621,863.295,"Appreciate this opportunity to call, and I am calling about an urgent matter that's not on the agenda that I hope you can introduce a resolution.",21,,
121,0.97,863.295,870.236,"As you may have heard, two more people were killed by the light rail train in the Ranier Valley on Friday.",21,,
122,0.97,870.236,882.848,"Úthat brings to number 10 Peopl that have been killed, pedestrians have been killed by light rail since 2019.",21,,
123,0.97,882.848,892.691,"At the April meeting of--the April 22nd meeting of sound transit's board, there was a presentation on the safety date, safety stuff relating to collisions.",21,,
124,0.97,892.691,897.296,There's been 140 collisions with vehicles in that time frame.,21,,
125,0.97,897.296,904.603,"There are three things that even though that only one of you are on the sound transit board, I do hope that you can push hard.",21,,
126,0.97,904.603,906.805,There are three things that can be done.,21,,
127,0.97,906.805,919.151,"As we all know, when the city adopted vision zero a couple of years ago, it was to have zero pedestrian deaths, and we--again, we've had 10 just from light rail since that time.",21,,
128,0.97,919.151,930.863,The three things that can be done is to insist that sound transit install railroad crossing arms at every crossing in the Ranier valley.,21,,
129,0.97,930.863,932.698,Those are installed in Soto.,21,,
130,0.97,932.698,952.651,"And those can help the people that have made the decision to try to Outsmart or Outwalk or whatever, they're not paying attention, for whatever reason, we need to make it more clear that there is a train coming, and that would help a lot, the flashing lights, the ringing bells and definitely the crossing arms can help.",21,,
131,0.97,952.651,964.563,You think two things that Sdot can do is to extend pedestrian crossing times because in this case pedestrians are crossing with the light.,21,,
132,0.97,964.563,977.276,"So the third thing would be to install an island Mid- intersection so people cannot make it across Mlk, can at least wait in the middle until they can safely cross.",21,,
133,0.97,977.276,977.81,Thank Yo very much.,21,,
134,0.97,977.81,988.253,I hope you get a resolution and get these things moving forward so we have greater safety in this horribly dangerous corridor.,21,,
135,0.97,988.253,989.488,Thank you.,22,,
136,0.97,989.488,994.126,"Colleagues, that concludes our speakers for this committee meeting.",22,,

207,0.97,1363.261,1364.162,Thank you.,46,,
208,0.97,1364.162,1371.803,"On June 26th, excuse me, June 16th our committee had a presentation and discussion concerning the strategic plan for Seattle city light.",46,,
209,0.97,1371.803,1386.351,"As you know, colleagues, it's a multi-year plan for implementing the mission of this $1 billion city-owned utility enterprise which provides affordable, reliable and environmentally responsible electricity to over 900,000 people in Seattle and the surrounding areas.",46,,
210,0.97,1386.351,1401.833,"As I noted at our previous meeting, I'm pleased that despite several cost pressures such as Covid and [inaudible] Seattle city lice has surpassed expectations in keeping their current rating increases under control.",46,,
211,0.97,1401.833,1407.706,Seattle city light succeeded in not increasing the bills of electricity customers this year.,46,,
212,0.97,1407.706,1411.476,We proved--approved an ordinance in March.,46,,
213,0.97,1411.476,1418.683,"Moreover, proposed city light's rate path will lower the rate increases in the future when compared to their previous strategic plan.",46,,
214,0.97,1418.683,1422.053,So the rates are going up at a much lower rate.,46,,
215,0.97,1422.053,1431.696,The net result is a six-year average annual increase will be less than 3.5% instead of the original 4.5% average annual increase.,46,,
216,0.97,1431.696,1441.44,"So today we'll hear from city light's customer review panel about why they endorse the plan and support it, adoption by the Council.",46,,
217,0.97,1441.44,1453.151,"There is also a letter that they wrote which is part of the agenda materials: after the presentation we can discuss this further, and I hope to vote this out of committee today.",46,,
218,0.97,1453.151,1462.394,"So I think we're going to hear from our general manager, Debra Smith, and she can turn it over to the rest of the folks.",46,,
219,0.97,1462.394,1464.663,We also have Eric Mcconhugh from central city staff.,46,,
220,0.97,1464.663,1467.465,"Eric, did you want to go ahead and say anything first?",46,,
221,0.97,1467.465,1470.001,I would just like to say good morning.,47,,
222,0.97,1470.001,1470.902,Thank you for recognizing me.,47,,
223,0.97,1470.902,1486.952,"Just note that the typical path for city light to bring rates and the strategic plan to Council and then the rate ordinance because of the contingents and the difficulties of Covid, there was a pause and kind of a Rewording of those events.",47,,
224,0.97,1486.952,1494.926,"So what you see before you, you saw on June 16th is a strategic plan that Comports with the rate ordinance that you passed earlier this year.",47,,
225,0.97,1494.926,1495.46,Everything is lining up.,47,,
226,0.97,1495.46,1500.232,And that was the kind of thing that we were looking forward to make sure that would happen.,47,,
227,0.97,1500.232,1502.434,We didn't have a lot of doubt that it would.,47,,
228,0.97,1502.434,1505.503,"But that was sort of the gut check, so to speak.",47,,
229,0.97,1505.503,1519.851,"And then next time we look at it we'll be with the budget, council will be turning to the budget in fall, and that's another time to take a look at City light's planning, long- term capital improvement plan, and that's always an important and useful exercise.",47,,
230,0.97,1519.851,1526.825,And then also importantly there'll be a big reset next year into the regular strategic plan and then rate path patterns.,47,,
231,0.97,1526.825,1532.197,So the Council will get another chance to look at City light's strategic planning in 2022.,47,,
232,0.97,1532.197,1534.466,So those are the things I wanted to cover.,47,,
233,0.97,1534.466,1538.336,And thanks for the moment to say them.,47,,
234,0.97,1538.336,1540.272,"Thank you, Eric.",48,,
235,0.97,1540.272,1540.672,Yeah.,49,,
236,0.97,1540.672,1543.742,"Good morning, Debra Smith, the general manager of city light and her team.",50,,
237,0.97,1543.742,1550.982,"Thank you so much, chair Pedersen and members of the committee: happy to be here.",51,,
238,0.97,1550.982,1552.584,"Thank you for your comments, Eric.",51,,
239,0.97,1552.584,1558.757,"We have no power point for this item, so that's good news for those of you who spend all day looking at Powerpoints.",51,,
240,0.97,1558.757,1562.627,And I'm excited to be here for our second conversation.,51,,
241,0.97,1562.627,1564.629,I don't have a lot to say.,51,,
242,0.97,1564.629,1569.167,This was my first strategic plan.,51,,
243,0.97,1569.167,1570.535,It's been a really great process.,51,,
244,0.97,1570.535,1587.819,"We've been honored to work with a wonderful review panel, and we've really tried to engage them and use the strategic planning process as an opportunity to invite them in and train them on more things and on things that we're doing, Academy we plan to continue that cadence and that practice.",51,,
245,0.97,1587.819,1590.889,"So as Eric mentioned, this is kind of our in between plan.",51,,
246,0.97,1590.889,1594.392,I was thinking it's kind of like the Olympics.,51,,
247,0.97,1594.392,1598.897,"We'll all get back on the same schedule going forward, but for right now we're playing catchup.",51,,
248,0.97,1598.897,1607.806,"And so this is a five-year plan, although we customarily and in the future will present for you a six-year plan.",51,,
249,0.97,1607.806,1618.85,Mike Hanson who is also one of our--he is our major customer representative on the review panel.,51,,
250,0.97,1618.85,1623.088,"He runs Savey in Tukwila, and he has been just a delight to work with.",51,,
251,0.97,1623.088,1637.335,He probably knew a little bit more about city light than some review panel members as they joined because he's a major customer and has been an involved major customer in the activities that city lights put on.,51,,
252,0.97,1637.335,1647.512,"But he's really had a great--well, he's done a great job of asking the right questions and really encouraging us to move in the direction that honors the future.",51,,
253,0.97,1647.512,1656.821,So I'm not going to take up any more time other than to really quickly introduce you to who's here from city light in case you have questions.,51,,
254,0.97,1656.821,1660.558,Our Cfo Kristy Grairng is with us.,51,,
255,0.97,1660.558,1664.529,Maura Brugger is here and running the Powerpoint.,51,,
256,0.97,1664.529,1672.203,Lee Baraka who's in charge of strategic planning and who works closely and closest with the review panel is also here.,51,,
257,0.97,1672.203,1674.973,"So both Kristy, Lee, myself are all happy to answer questions.",51,,
258,0.97,1674.973,1681.546,Right now I'm going to turn things over.,51,,
259,0.97,1681.546,1682.814,Thank you.,51,,
260,0.97,1682.814,1683.948,"Thank you, Debra, good morning.",52,,
261,0.97,1683.948,1698.53,"Chair Pedersen and members of the transportation and utilities Committee, I think first off I'd like to thank the current members of our panel for their efforts.",53,,
262,0.97,1698.53,1725.523,"Sarah Patton, she represents the nonprofit energy efficiency advocate position, Scott Haskins is our financial analysis representative and the customer representative and John is the At-Large representative customer and Tim skill who's the economic adviser, his appointment is pending.",53,,
263,0.97,1725.523,1751.816,"We actually have three vacancies currently on the panel, and one of the things I've kind of marveled at is even with--by the nature of this group, there's some attrition and INS and outs, and, you know, people like Sarah and the Seattle city lights staff have done such a good job of ensuring that we can have continuity with the changes.",53,,
264,0.97,1751.816,1761.659,And so we're really proud of that because everybody is provided--or contributed to our work product and the people that came before us.,53,,
265,0.97,1761.659,1764.062,So everybody gets credit for that.,53,,
266,0.97,1764.062,1788.686,"And I'm here today to just give a Synopsis of our letter that I hope you've all had a chance to read that highlighted some of the things that we were really focused on during the strategic plan: as Debra said, I've been involved with Seattle city light on a pretty robust level for almost 20 years at all levels of the organization.",53,,
267,0.97,1788.686,1802.901,"And now being on this panel for the last two years, it, frankly, has been very refreshing to me to see how it all works kind of from an inside view.",53,,
268,0.97,1802.901,1813.978,"We've had just some tremendous people we've worked with from the utility and the review panel, and they've all Mentored us and helped us learn the ropes.",53,,
269,0.97,1813.978,1816.648,So very thankful for that.,53,,
270,0.97,1816.648,1837.669,"The A-Ha moment I guess really for me is the depth and breadth of the responsibilities, they're just so incredibly vast and complex, and, you know, Debra when she briefs us, it just makes my mind kind of spin and hurt all the things that the team is involved with.",53,,
271,0.97,1837.669,1876.708,"So, you know, it's a big operation, and I guess I'd like to tell the city Councilmembers at this meeting and for the Mayor's office that from my standpoint, Debra Smith has been--has just done an incredible job of assembling her team and it's a team of leaders, and her style--it's obvious that she's the leader, but she lets everybody, you know, really contribute, and she feels like there's just real Buy-In to the direction that she's taking the group.",53,,
272,0.97,1876.708,1881.412,And they all contribute in a very synergistic way.,53,,
273,0.97,1881.412,1891.289,And the transparency and the patience for some of us really has helped us to be able to perform our responsibilities.,53,,
274,0.97,1891.289,1895.46,"We power, that's the mission, and it is a thing.",53,,
275,0.97,1895.46,1902.533,"They all live it, and it comes across that way.",53,,
276,0.97,1902.533,1909.44,"So that's really an amazing--you know, from watching different operations, I have a lot of admiration for how that is all clicking.",53,,
277,0.97,1909.44,1914.979,"It's a big operation, and these things don't happen overnight.",53,,
278,0.97,1914.979,1926.858,"I'd also like to thank Karen Reed, Lee Barak and Roy Krueger for their countless hours to support and drive our panel.",53,,
279,0.97,1926.858,1933.398,"We have long meetings and frequently and they're work meetings, they're productive.",53,,
280,0.97,1933.398,1936.167,And thank you for all your help and oversight of that.,53,,
281,0.97,1936.167,1949.414,"Now, Seattle city light is an incredible green regional asset that we all want to protect and improve through our measured environmental stewardship.",53,,
282,0.97,1949.414,1958.589,And our list--our letter summarized a list of the successes and some of the key strategies that we were focused on as a group.,53,,
283,0.97,1958.589,1982.113,"And I'll just touch on a few of them because I felt particularly strong about the--you know, first off, and chair Pedersen touched on it, but this financial position with the double-A bond rating, you know, in the times that we've gone through, it's amazing how level this ship continued.",53,,
284,0.97,1982.113,1991.823,"We're able to increase the participation in the utility discount program, you know, everybody was focused on that.",53,,
285,0.97,1991.823,2022.453,"The pilot programs, they took a little time to really get launched due to some of the constraints we were all faced with recently, but, you know, they're focused on testing new rate designs, improving energy equity to help and improve inefficient energy use, the demand response rates and the time of day use, you know, all leading edge kind of responses to what today's customers want.",53,,
286,0.97,2022.453,2023.02,Improve load forecasting.,53,,
287,0.97,2023.02,2056.621,"You know, now from the viewpoint of joining the Western energy and balance market and adding $8 billion talks about this being a long energy--or long utility because we have excess capacity, but being able to, you know, successfully market that at the highest return is really key to what's happened over the last 12 to 18 months.",53,,
288,0.97,2056.621,2065.997,So on the strategy side what I gleaned from the Seattle city light team is really the improvement of the customer experience.,53,,
289,0.97,2065.997,2071.369,How do we view what we do at City light from a customer's focus.,53,,
290,0.97,2071.369,2084.382,"And with that lens, you get all kinds of insights into what today's customers want, and we will remain focused in everybody we do on race and social justice.",53,,
291,0.97,2084.382,2093.825,That's one of the real drivers of the customer experience that is part of our plan.,53,,
292,0.97,2093.825,2098.629,"Creating our energy future, the team talks about the grid modernization.",53,,
293,0.97,2098.629,2106.304,Sometimes it's a little difficult to get your arms around what that really means on a tactical level.,53,,
294,0.97,2106.304,2112.443,But Debra used a metaphor at the June 16th meeting that Resonated with me.,53,,
295,0.97,2112.443,2113.644,It's the Motorola of flip phones.,53,,
296,0.97,2113.644,2124.422,"You know, the flip phone works just fine for phone calls, but you can't do all the maps and Apps and all the other things, you know, that a smart phone does.",53,,
297,0.97,2124.422,2139.237,"And when you think about grid modernization, how do we more smartly use, you know, the distribution system that we have today, and that's really key to our future.",53,,
298,0.97,2139.237,2174.105,"Work force agility, you know, there's a lot of talk about cultural and organizational agility, and agility, you know, billion dollar operation people tough things that lay on top of each other, but that's certainly the goal is to have that agility and really do what's best for the organization as it relates to labor, relationships and the values that the labor folks bring and, you know, the staff, the team, I mean, how do we mesh all those things together?",53,,
299,0.97,2174.105,2177.842,So there's a real focus on that.,53,,
300,0.97,2177.842,2193.157,"And the point has been made, and I think it's right on the money is if we don't have an organizational change management system, we can have all the initiatives that we want, but we gotTA be able to measure them, and we gotTA be able to track them and know that we're succeeding on those things.",53,,
301,0.97,2193.157,2200.364,So that will all be part of that agility.,53,,
302,0.97,2200.364,2206.737,"Under financial health and Affordability, keeping rates manageable, chair Pedersen talked about the 3 1/2% over the next five years.",53,,
303,0.97,2206.737,2217.415,"That certainly is far better than what was contemplated in previous plans, and we're very pleased about that.",53,,
304,0.97,2217.415,2231.462,"Predictability, you know, as a commercial customer representative and as a resident, if you have predictability, it really EASES any concerns and planning of what you're going to do going forward.",53,,
305,0.97,2231.462,2240.771,"We've had a growth in receivables that we're well aware of, both on the residential side and the commercial side, and those are things we have our eye on.",53,,
306,0.97,2240.771,2253.718,"And as a panel, we certainly ask about it at each meeting, nd we're certain that the staff is focused on how to, you know, manage that going forward because we will have to do that.",53,,
307,0.97,2253.718,2264.362,"Right SIZING the capital improvement plan, the panel feels very strong about, you know, how will that be funded, will it be from operations, will it be borrowed funds?",53,,
308,0.97,2264.362,2276.44,"And those are big decisions, and the panel really has a great interest in how those things are going to be funded.",53,,
309,0.97,2276.44,2293.524,"You know, growing clean demand, Electrification is what we've all talked about, you know, with port and Metro, and what other things can we do to, you know, improve our revenue stream?",53,,
310,0.97,2293.524,2298.696,"It's really taken a big hit with the office buildings reducing all the things, all their occupancies.",53,,
311,0.97,2298.696,2306.637,"And so there's a number of things going there, but revenue decline is something we're really going to have to keep our eye on.",53,,
312,0.97,2306.637,2316.914,"And we've made some assumptions on the Electrification, and we're going to have to check those frequently because they're ambitious, and we have partners and there's lots that needs to be done.",53,,
313,0.97,2316.914,2324.955,The final part of the financial health is the discussion of the reserve Fund and the rate stabilization account.,53,,
314,0.97,2324.955,2328.993,How do we get that right sized?,53,,
315,0.97,2328.993,2337.668,"It was, you know, save for the rainy Mondays, and now we have to take a look at that.",53,,
316,0.97,2337.668,2343.974,"$100 million is a lot of money of keeping that Fund, and, you know, what is the right size for that?",53,,
317,0.97,2343.974,2344.442,Where should we be?,53,,
318,0.97,2344.442,2350.548,And that'll be a big part of what we're talking about going forward.,53,,
319,0.97,2350.548,2354.952,And this will be the final one that I'd just like to mention.,53,,
320,0.97,2354.952,2367.264,"It didn't make it into our letter for no particular reason, but the Cybersecurity issue that's, you know, international is so important to the city of Seattle and the Seattle city light.",53,,
321,0.97,2367.264,2379.376,"We just want to make sure--we've talked about it a fair bit at our meetings, make sure that this group and the committee is aware of how important we think that is to protect our systems.",53,,
322,0.97,2379.376,2388.352,"And while we all--we're all going through that as individuals and businesses, so really just wanted to keep that in front of everybody.",53,,
323,0.97,2388.352,2395.159,And the final comment I'd like to make today is the panel wholeheartedly endorses this plan.,53,,
324,0.97,2395.159,2399.497,We feel like we really had a big hand in working through it.,53,,
325,0.97,2399.497,2403.868,"And now it's the Flushout, the measurable targets and benchmarks.",53,,
326,0.97,2403.868,2409.54,"We all want to hold each other accountable and achieve this impressive plan, and we'll need to do that with some Metrics.",53,,
327,0.97,2409.54,2413.611,"So that concludes what I had to say today, and I thank you very much for your time.",53,,
328,0.97,2413.611,2417.448,"And if there are any questions I can answer, I'd be happy to do that.",53,,
329,0.97,2417.448,2418.315,"Thank you, Mr. Hanson.",54,,
330,0.97,2418.315,2448.679,"And thank you for your service on the city light review panel and the other members of the city light review panel I want to thank them for the countless hours they spend helping us to provide oversight of the Utilityand all that they do, really appreciate the focus on trying to keep rates as affordable as possible since these--since utility bills are essentially Regressive with lower income households paying a greater percentage of their household income.",54,,
331,0.97,2448.679,2463.16,And so thank you for focusing on the Affordability and also emerging issues such as Cybertechnology which we're reading a lot about with other large Enterprises having to deal with that.,54,,
332,0.97,2463.16,2467.264,And so we know our city is vigilant on that.,54,,
333,0.97,2467.264,2475.706,But appreciate the additional oversight from the review panel on that.,54,,
334,0.97,2475.706,2479.476,"Councilmembers, any questions for city light or for Mr.",54,,
335,0.97,2479.476,2487.017,"Hanson on the review panel, the letter, the four-page letter from the review panel was very dense in its content.",54,,
336,0.97,2487.017,2491.055,But that's on the agenda as well.,54,,
337,0.97,2491.055,2495.693,"And just for the viewing public, yes, general manager, Smith.",54,,
338,0.97,2495.693,2507.071,"Councilmember, I just wanted to take a moment if I could to respond a bit to Mr. Ruby's comment just because, you know, our commitment to energy efficiency has not in any way Wained.",55,,
339,0.97,2507.071,2512.743,I want to be clear about that.,55,,
340,0.97,2512.743,2528.926,"You know, we traditionally--energy efficiency money gets spent in lumpy ways, that's one way to think about it, especially as we have increased our focus on large commercial and industrial energy efficiency which is quite frankly--Ms. Ruby is absolutely right.",55,,
341,0.97,2528.926,2534.865,A lot of our residential housing stock is in very good shape because we've been investing in it for such a long time.,55,,
342,0.97,2534.865,2543.674,"There's a lot of value out there in lighting, in refrigeration and other things that tend to be more focused on larger customers.",55,,
343,0.97,2543.674,2545.976,And so it comes to us in lumpy ways.,55,,
344,0.97,2545.976,2550.114,And that's because it's based on when the project is actually finished.,55,,
345,0.97,2550.114,2557.788,"So what we do is we budget an amount each year, and in this case right now it's about $30 million a year, so it's real money.",55,,
346,0.97,2557.788,2566.23,"And then what we do is we adjust our actual spending, and we make room for different pots of money based on the projects that come our way.",55,,
347,0.97,2566.23,2584.748,"There's lots of mechanisms even that Bonneville offers that allows customers to move money between years because some of our money does come back to us from Bonneville, and so there are tools because they understand the Lumpiness of acquiring energy efficiency, especially in the industrial sector.",55,,
348,0.97,2584.748,2588.619,So we have and are completing our new conservation potential assessment.,55,,
349,0.97,2588.619,2590.788,We'll be bringing it to Council this fall.,55,,
350,0.97,2590.788,2605.336,"So you will have an opportunity to look at our projected investments based on the most recent data, and we use the same company that does the CPA for Bonneville, so we're aligned with the region which is very important.",55,,
351,0.97,2605.336,2607.938,And so we'll have an opportunity to talk about it then.,55,,
352,0.97,2607.938,2615.612,"The other thing that's important is that even with the $30 million that we traditionally budget, we typically don't spend it all.",55,,
353,0.97,2615.612,2620.651,And we are Recalibrating right now based on economic recovery.,55,,
354,0.97,2620.651,2626.223,Energy efficiency does require an investment on the part of our large commercial customers.,55,,
355,0.97,2626.223,2638.836,"So the investments that they make are competing with their other capital investments, and we recognize right now coming through Covid that times are a little--we're less certain, that's one of the reasons we did a five-year plan.",55,,
356,0.97,2638.836,2643.44,So all that is to say--and I have not even seen the draft CPA yet.,55,,
357,0.97,2643.44,2650.547,But all that is to say that our commitment to energy efficiency as the least cost resource has in no way diminished.,55,,
358,0.97,2650.547,2658.055,"And I just wanted to assure Council of that and you of that, personally, Councilmembers, so that you would understand where we're at.",55,,
359,0.97,2658.055,2665.462,"And so we'll be, and we'll be in a position to answer any and all questions when we come back with the CPA this fall.",55,,
360,0.97,2665.462,2673.303,"But, you know, Seattle city light is the grandfather of efficiency out in the region because we're so old, because we've been doing it for so long.",55,,
361,0.97,2673.303,2680.944,"We've been doing energy efficiency before it was cool to do--what was that song, I was country when country wasn't cool?",55,,
362,0.97,2680.944,2683.547,We were energy efficiency when energy efficiency wasn't cool.,55,,
363,0.97,2683.547,2686.016,So we're there and we will continue.,55,,
364,0.97,2686.016,2699.596,"Also, just one last thing, and this is kind of just a quick educational moment, there is some movement and some of the pilots and the work that we're doing, we think of energy efficiency in a fairly traditional way.",55,,
365,0.97,2699.596,2709.573,But the language that gets used more and more is distributed energy resources or Ders.,55,,
366,0.97,2709.573,2714.845,And it's more than sticking a generation other than somewhere into the distribution system and pumping it out to customers.,55,,
367,0.97,2714.845,2723.02,"So energy efficiency is a form of Ders, as is demand response, as is a whole lot of new tools that are coming our way.",55,,
368,0.97,2723.02,2749.246,"So we are mindful as we think about how we will spend those dollars in the future about the direction that the industry is going, where Bonneville is moneys because that's does change over time, and we are intentionally carving out money to be able to Robustly fund energy efficiency incentives per the transportation Electrification strategic investment plan.",55,,
369,0.97,2749.246,2749.546,I said it!,55,,
370,0.97,2749.546,2757.588,So the thing I want you to know there is I know--[inaudible] noted the plan did not seem as robust.,55,,
371,0.97,2757.588,2760.457,That was the very high plan that was approved by Council.,55,,
372,0.97,2760.457,2763.56,And staff is continuing to work on the implementation plan.,55,,
373,0.97,2763.56,2766.764,We're also working on our Ceda implementation plan.,55,,
374,0.97,2766.764,2781.178,"As we pointed out in the strategic plan in one of the Pias, one of our goals--and Mike mentioned that in his Intro, is to coordinate or to bring all of our planning processes together so that they are aligned.",55,,
375,0.97,2781.178,2786.45,"So that's strategic planning, resource planning, financial planning, Cedo planning.",55,,
376,0.97,2786.45,2793.924,"Anyway, hold us accountable to that, but nothing has changed, and we're all in.",55,,
377,0.97,2793.924,2796.293,"Thank you, general manager, Smith.",56,,
378,0.97,2796.293,2808.438,"Councilmembers, any questions for Seattle city light or for the city light review panel before we vote on this resolution for the strategic plan and pass it along to the full council?",56,,
379,0.97,2808.438,2808.639,Okay.,56,,
380,0.97,2808.639,2813.977,"And for the viewing public, we had a thorough review and discussion of this last month as well.",56,,
381,0.97,2813.977,2820.384,This is our second hearing of this.,56,,
382,0.97,2820.384,2823.62,So I think we're ready to vote.,56,,
383,0.97,2823.62,2823.82,Okay.,56,,
384,0.97,2823.82,2835.098,So I'd like to move that the committee recommend passage of this resolution which is resolution 32007.,56,,
385,0.97,2835.098,2836.366,Is there a second?,56,,
386,0.97,2836.366,2836.7,Second.,57,,
387,0.97,2836.7,2837.301,Thank you.,58,,
388,0.97,2837.301,2843.607,It's been moved and Seconded to recommend passage of the resolution.,58,,
389,0.97,2843.607,2844.107,Any final comments?,58,,
390,0.97,2844.107,2844.308,Okay.,58,,
391,0.97,2844.308,2858.889,Will the clerk please call the roll on the committee recommendation that resolution 32007 be approved for forwarding to the full city council? L,58,,
392,0.97,2858.889,2859.756,Gonzalez.,59,,
393,0.97,2859.756,2859.99,Yea.,60,,
394,0.97,2859.99,2862.125,Herbold.,61,,
395,0.97,2862.125,2863.026,Yes.,62,,
396,0.97,2863.026,2864.494,Morales.,63,,
397,0.97,2864.494,2864.761,Yes.,64,,
398,0.97,2864.761,2866.096,Strauss.,65,,
399,0.97,2866.096,2866.797,Yes.,66,,
400,0.97,2866.797,2867.564,Chair Pedersen.,67,,
401,0.97,2867.564,2867.831,Yes.,68,,
402,0.97,2867.831,2870.701,"Five in favor, none opposed.",69,,
403,0.97,2870.701,2871.702,Thank you.,70,,
404,0.97,2871.702,2878.075,"The motion carries, and the committee recommendation is that the resolution be sent for approval to the July 12th city council meeting.",70,,
405,0.97,2878.075,2878.375,Thank you.,70,,
406,0.97,2878.375,2882.946,I think city light will be staying--some of you will be staying with us for this next item.,70,,
407,0.97,2882.946,2893.29,Will the clerk please read the short title of the next agenda item into the record?,70,,
408,0.97,2893.29,2919.516,"Agenda item 3, council billion 21003, an ordinance relating to the city light Department authorizing the chief executive officer and general manager to execute a long-term lease and operating agreement with the Georgetown steam plant community development authority for the use and occupancy of the city's Georgetown steam plant property, a national historic landmark for briefing, discussion and possible vote.",71,,
409,0.97,2919.516,2922.319,Thank you.,72,,
410,0.97,2922.319,2929.393,Seattle city light proudly owns unique Century-Old electricity plant that used to generate electricity in the Georgetown neighborhood called the Georgetown steam plant.,72,,
411,0.97,2929.393,2940.871,"Over the past few decades, city light has ensured that the historic nature of the plant has been recognized under Federal and local laws and that grants were obtained to start the conservation.",72,,
412,0.97,2940.871,2947.311,The utility has negotiated with the nonprofit to take over operation of the historic site with a long-term lease from city light.,72,,
413,0.97,2947.311,2963.06,"City Council central staff has reviewed the Council bill and all the attachments, and we've concluded the executive has negotiated a suitable lease that should protect the city's interests, including an assumption by the Lessee of liability and insurance coverage.",72,,
414,0.97,2963.06,2964.995,"Thank you, everybody, from city light for being here.",72,,
415,0.97,2964.995,2973.503,"I wanted to open it up first, though, to our city council central staff.",72,,
416,0.97,2973.503,2976.807,"Eric Mcconaghy, if you have any opening remarks.",72,,
417,0.97,2976.807,2977.274,You're welcome.,73,,
418,0.97,2977.274,2981.411,I'll just highlight a few things and let city light take it from there.,73,,
419,0.97,2981.411,2986.283,"As you mentioned, chair Pedersen, it's a long-term lease, a 30-year term lease.",73,,
420,0.97,2986.283,2990.687,There are options for two 15- year renewals that would be in this lease.,73,,
421,0.97,2990.687,2998.895,"Those renewals would be by the mutual agreement of both parties by the lease that, would be the city and the community development authority.",73,,
422,0.97,2998.895,3019.483,"Under the lease, city light wouldn't sort of traditionally collect rent for the lease but would look to the CDA to perform its obligations under the lease as to operate the building as a historic building with a museum with public tours, historical interpretation, maintenance, Janitorial and other public services.",73,,
423,0.97,3019.483,3038.869,"And so that's the nature of this sort of rent or compensation, as well there's additional language in the lease that would say after the first year of the lease, the CDA would be required to pay city light 10% of the--for commercial use of the facility.",73,,
424,0.97,3038.869,3046.843,I wanted to highlight those aspects because those may be different than other kinds of lease agreements that come to Council or that we're familiar with in other Contebses.,73,,
425,0.97,3046.843,3053.517,Overall the lease would require that the city maintain and repair the Georgetown steam plant as it exists at the time of signing the lease.,73,,
426,0.97,3053.517,3065.629,"You can think of it as being the roof, the exterior, the supporting structures, the floor, the beam, major maintenance related to things like the electrical and heating systems, the fencing of the gates.",73,,
427,0.97,3065.629,3082.679,"I think of them as being the sort of mainstay or sort of, like, skeleton, the building as it stands, any of the new things, improvements, modifications would be the responsibility of CDA.",73,,
428,0.97,3082.679,3095.759,"Both parties would agree to participate together to seek third-party grants, and that makes sense, going forward, of course, for aspects of maintaining and operating the steam plant.",73,,
429,0.97,3095.759,3100.03,And then other pieces I think will be handled well.,73,,
430,0.97,3100.03,3100.964,Another presentation for city council.,73,,
431,0.97,3100.964,3104.501,Those are the main things I wanted to point out.,73,,
432,0.97,3104.501,3122.886,"The decision to keep the building in the possession of city light and to find a nonprofit partner was informed by over a group that was put together by--excuse me, by city light and that group was the--so many long names for this.",73,,
433,0.97,3122.886,3123.186,Forgive me.,73,,
434,0.97,3123.186,3128.191,"I want to make sure I get this right, the Georgetown steam plant advisory committee.",73,,
435,0.97,3128.191,3136.666,"That was formed in 2016, and they did work through that year, and beginning of 2017 presented their representation to city light.",73,,
436,0.97,3136.666,3143.874,Among the recommendation was to prefer keeping the building in the possession of the city and finding a nonprofit partner.,73,,
437,0.97,3143.874,3153.416,City light followed that recommendation and there a request of proposals connected with Equinox which formed the CDA that is the nonprofit that would be subject to the lease.,73,,
438,0.97,3153.416,3155.685,That's probably enough of me talking.,73,,
439,0.97,3155.685,3162.592,But I feel good about hitting those main points in my--from my point of view.,73,,
440,0.97,3162.592,3168.365,"And unless there's any questions for me about those sorts of things, I'll turn it over from here.",73,,
441,0.97,3168.365,3168.865,"Thank you, Eric.",74,,
442,0.97,3168.865,3175.005,"And general manager Smith, did you want to leave that off from city light?",74,,
443,0.97,3175.005,3176.506,"Yes, thanks so much.",75,,
444,0.97,3176.506,3177.674,It's exciting to be here.,75,,
445,0.97,3177.674,3182.779,"This is an exciting thing for Seattle, for the community and for city light.",75,,
446,0.97,3182.779,3187.184,"And I have to say, I have never met Sam.",75,,
447,0.97,3187.184,3189.419,"So Hi, Sam, nice to meet you in person.",75,,
448,0.97,3189.419,3191.788,I've heard so much about you.,75,,
449,0.97,3191.788,3200.664,"So we are here to talk about this, and my team Julianna Ross, she's going to be presenting.",75,,
450,0.97,3200.664,3204.067,She is the heart and soul of the Georgetown steam plant.,75,,
451,0.97,3204.067,3212.943,"And if I was there with you, I'd say we would show hands to who visited the Georgetown steam plant because it's very, very cool.",75,,
452,0.97,3212.943,3217.747,"If you haven't, I'm going to do a plug for it.",75,,
453,0.97,3217.747,3221.685,"And if you're really, really fortunate, Julianna would probably give you the tour herself.",75,,
454,0.97,3221.685,3223.553,It's very worth it.,75,,
455,0.97,3223.553,3226.756,We'd love to schedule for you if you're interested.,75,,
456,0.97,3226.756,3246.943,"The team in addition to Julianna is Tim Coo ll, and Mura is running the Powerpoint.",75,,
457,0.97,3246.943,3247.677,"Sam, I'm super thankful.",75,,
458,0.97,3247.677,3255.986,I'm going to turn it over to staff now.,75,,
459,0.97,3255.986,3266.329,Thank you so much.,75,,
460,0.97,3269.633,3270.9,Great.,76,,
461,0.97,3270.9,3272.702,Please go ahead.,76,,
462,0.97,3272.702,3276.139,"Okay, thank you.",77,,
463,0.97,3276.139,3277.607,"Next slide, please, Maura.",77,,
464,0.97,3277.607,3281.478,So Eric just ran us through what we're requesting your authorization for.,77,,
465,0.97,3281.478,3288.685,So thank you very much for having us here today.,77,,
466,0.97,3288.685,3289.085,Next slide.,77,,
467,0.97,3289.085,3293.123,I'm going to take you through 115 years of history in less than five minutes.,77,,
468,0.97,3293.123,3294.024,So here we go.,77,,
469,0.97,3294.024,3300.93,The Georgetown steam plant was built by the Seattle electric company over the course of a year in 1906 to 1907.,77,,
470,0.97,3300.93,3304.668,It was built to fill Seattle's growing electric streetcar system.,77,,
471,0.97,3304.668,3308.738,It was located on the Bank of the Duwamish River and used for cooling.,77,,
472,0.97,3308.738,3314.744,"Later when the river was straightened for the industry, a Flum was built from the plant to the industry which was one mile away.",77,,
473,0.97,3314.744,3327.757,The plume has now been Decommissioned and the pump house on the river related to the Georgetown steam plant is Landmarked and owned by the Seattle parks and recreation.,77,,
474,0.97,3327.757,3328.191,Next slide.,77,,
475,0.97,3328.191,3329.959,The building is Landmarked and so is all the equipment inside.,77,,
476,0.97,3329.959,3339.869,"It is very rare to have a building like this left intact, and, in fact, the steam plant has only two of the vertical steam turbines left in place in the world.",77,,
477,0.97,3339.869,3348.111,"These turbines were the height of technological innovation at the time, having a considerably smaller Footprint than their predecessors.",77,,
478,0.97,3348.111,3362.192,Over the next 10 years two other turbines were added to generate progressively more energy.,77,,
479,0.97,3362.192,3363.326,The building has many interesting features.,77,,
480,0.97,3363.326,3374.971,"It is one of the first reinforced concrete buildings on the West Coast, and it was also designed to use gravity in its processes and run on either coal or oil, whichever was most economical at the time.",77,,
481,0.97,3374.971,3382.679,Having access to see and learn from this historical equipment and engineering is invaluable to visitors of the steam plant.,77,,
482,0.97,3382.679,3394.424,Operator classes come through for the rare opportunity to see this kind of equipment out in the open and not enclosed behind casings as with modern equipment.,77,,
483,0.97,3394.424,3394.724,Next slide.,77,,
484,0.97,3394.724,3404.868,"Seattle city light purchased the steam plant in 1951 and kept it operational for standby purposes until about 1974, fully decommissioning it in 1977.",77,,
485,0.97,3404.868,3413.076,Several actions by people enlightened to the Georgetown steam plant's historical significance resulted in a string of important historic and other designations.,77,,
486,0.97,3413.076,3425.255,"These designations help protect the plant, impose controls and incentives on any changes and also make the building eligible for special historic preservation funding.",77,,
487,0.97,3425.255,3425.555,Next slide.,77,,
488,0.97,3425.555,3433.263,"In late 2014, staff from city light began volunteering to open the steam plant to the pun for four hours the second Saturday of every month.",77,,
489,0.97,3433.263,3442.272,"In Pre-Covid times, these open houses would attract an average of 100 visitors who loved to explore, take pictures and enjoy one of the two guided tours offered each open house.",77,,
490,0.97,3442.272,3450.313,Private tours are also provided at the request of community groups and schools.,77,,
491,0.97,3450.313,3450.613,Next slide.,77,,
492,0.97,3450.613,3455.785,"A special quality of the steam plant is the diversity of interest it appeals to, including the arts.",77,,
493,0.97,3455.785,3473.57,"Over the past six years or so, we've been pleased to host several art presentations, including a Site-Specific play, a Site-Specific dance performance, an 11-Hour multimedia arts festival and many other unique performances and events.",77,,
494,0.97,3473.57,3473.87,Next slide.,77,,
495,0.97,3473.87,3488.384,"To optimize public use and access and continue needed restoration and maintenance, city light organized the Georgetown steam plant advisory committee, a group of experts from relevant fields to advise on the best ways to Sustainably program, Fund and manage this historic building.",77,,
496,0.97,3488.384,3496.359,The logos here indicate just a few of the organizations who lent us their expertise over the course of about a year and a half.,77,,
497,0.97,3496.359,3508.738,Their published recommendations which were accepted by city light were for city light to maintain ownership of the building and seek an appropriate nonprofit Pfer to assume regular operations and programming of the plant to benefit the public.,77,,
498,0.97,3508.738,3518.114,"In 2018, we issued and publicized an Rfp, and in 2019, we accepted the proposal of a newly formed nonprofit, the Georgetown steam plant community development authority.",77,,
499,0.97,3518.114,3531.628,"It has been a pleasure working out the details of this partnership, and we are confident the community development authority will Dheav an exciting and economically sustainable feature for the Georgetown steam plant.",77,,
500,0.97,3531.628,3531.961,Next slide.,77,,
501,0.97,3531.961,3539.802,"Out of the gate, the most pressing work for the new partner includes bringing the building up to code to accommodate the desired level of public programming.",77,,
502,0.97,3539.802,3556.386,"To that end, the CDA has built a team of design and construction professionals and has already made progress through the discovery phase, including consulting with Sdci, assembling Predesigned work and a tier 3 seismic analysis.",77,,
503,0.97,3556.386,3556.686,Next slide.,77,,
504,0.97,3556.686,3571.701,"In Tandem with restoration work and fundraising, the CDA will commence community outreach, both to build out their board of directors in an equitable matter and also solicit community input to ensure future programming through the input of a community advisory board.",77,,
505,0.97,3571.701,3584.814,"As required by the lease, the development authority is committed to maintaining a board of directors reflective of diverse communities residing and working in the Duwamish Valley and is Partnering with other organizations whose boards and staff represent the same.",77,,
506,0.97,3584.814,3593.523,Now we'll hand it over to my colleague Tim Croll to give an overview of the lease itself.,77,,
507,0.97,3593.523,3593.856,Next slide.,77,,
508,0.97,3593.856,3594.891,Thank you.,78,,
509,0.97,3594.891,3603.599,"So the highlights of the lease, lease a long-term one, as Eric mentioned, 30 years plus possibly two 15-year extensions.",78,,
510,0.97,3603.599,3613.977,This allows the CDA the certainty they need to support large-scale fundraising that was indicated in Julianna's slide to upgrade the use of the plant.,78,,
511,0.97,3613.977,3629.058,"The CDA's use is limited to interpreting and protecting the plant, promoting arts culture, science, technology, engineering and math and other education, and enabling community use and other events.",78,,
512,0.97,3629.058,3635.298,The paramount purpose is the preservation and the restoration of the historic Georgetown steam plant building.,78,,
513,0.97,3635.298,3643.973,So any alterations to the facilities are subject to city light approval and also to Seattle landmark board's approval.,78,,
514,0.97,3643.973,3652.615,"City light maintains, as Eric pointed out, we're responsible for maintaining the general large systems in the walls and the roof.",78,,
515,0.97,3652.615,3660.323,"And to the level they're at right now, and within our approved budget.",78,,
516,0.97,3660.323,3673.569,"The CDA is--their goal is to work on fundraising to bring the building up to code, to expand the use and to add amenities to promote the various purposes and education and events.",78,,
517,0.97,3673.569,3678.875,The lease also allows for further additions in our property.,78,,
518,0.97,3678.875,3692.055,"We have adjacent property which we can include in the future under the premises of the lease, and we are in the middle of negotiating better access with King County International Airport.",78,,
519,0.97,3692.055,3696.059,"And when we achieve that, then we would make that available to the CDA.",78,,
520,0.97,3696.059,3701.597,Those are the highlights of the lease.,78,,
521,0.97,3701.597,3707.937,Thank you both very much.,79,,
522,0.97,3707.937,3714.677,"Councilmembers, any questions about the Georgetown steam plant project or the proposed lease before us?",79,,
523,0.97,3714.677,3720.75,"Councilmember Morales, if you wanted to say anything about the project in your district.",79,,
524,0.97,3720.75,3721.05,Yeah.,80,,
525,0.97,3721.05,3721.851,Thank you.,80,,
526,0.97,3721.851,3725.354,"Thanks, everybody, for the presentation.",80,,
527,0.97,3725.354,3735.832,"You know, CDA important financial tools for advancing community priorities, and this is a great example of how they can work.",80,,
528,0.97,3735.832,3740.87,The Georgetown neighborhood really eager for more community amenities and more ways to celebrate the community.,80,,
529,0.97,3740.87,3756.152,"So, you know, this opportunity to create an education and science and arts center and to do it in a way that really honors community leadership and supports community ownership I think is really exciting.",80,,
530,0.97,3756.152,3771.4,"So I'm thankful to this team, I'm really thankful to Sam for his seemingly endless creativity and commitment to advancing projects like this and really excited for the opportunity to support this.",80,,
531,0.97,3771.4,3774.971,Thank you.,81,,
532,0.97,3774.971,3776.272,That's great to hear.,81,,
533,0.97,3776.272,3784.914,"Colleagues on the committee, any other comments or questions about this proposed long-term lease with the nonprofit?",81,,
534,0.97,3784.914,3785.114,Okay.,81,,
535,0.97,3785.114,3788.951,"Well, let's go ahead and move this forward.",81,,
536,0.97,3788.951,3798.561,"Councilmembers, I now move that the committee approve bill of 120-Item 3 on our agenda.",81,,
537,0.97,3798.561,3799.829,Is there a second?,81,,
538,0.97,3799.829,3801.03,Second.,82,,

540,0.97,3806.736,3807.17,Any final comments?,83,,
541,0.97,3807.17,3807.47,All right.,83,,

554,0.97,3829.425,3830.56,Thank you.,95,,
555,0.97,3830.56,3831.36,The motion carries.,95,,
556,0.97,3831.36,3840.469,And the committee recommendation that the bill passed will be sent to the July 12 city council meeting for final consideration.,95,,
557,0.97,3840.469,3841.571,"Thank you, everybody.",95,,
558,0.97,3841.571,3841.904,Thank you.,96,,

560,0.97,3843.139,3844.473,Thank you.,98,,
561,0.97,3844.473,3844.774,Bye Bye.,98,,
562,0.97,3844.774,3846.642,Thank you very much.,99,,
563,0.97,3846.642,3849.745,"Colleagues, we've got the fourth and final item on our agenda.",100,,
564,0.97,3849.745,3854.884,Will the clerk please read the short title of the next agenda item into the record?,100,,
565,0.97,3854.884,3887.483,"Agenda item 4, an ordinance relating to the traffic code amending sections 11.14.277, 11.16.121 and 11.76.015 of and adding a new section 11.14.276 to the Seattle municipal code to establish On-Street paid parking rates for large events that are expected to draw at least 10,000 attendees.",101,,
566,0.97,3887.483,3890.519,For a brief discussion and possible vote.,101,,
567,0.97,3890.519,3890.887,Thank you.,102,,
568,0.97,3890.887,3908.771,"In anticipation of large crowds gathering at Seattle center for upcoming events, including professional sports after the opening of climate pledge arena, formerly known as key arena, has developed a plan to increase On-Street parking rates in the surrounding neighborhood.",103,,
569,0.97,3908.771,3933.929,"I know that today will also want to clarify how this legislation might impact other areas in the city, and there's also an amendment that's been circulated, thank you, Councilmember Morales, for sending that around and would come from our city council central staff can address that amendment and try to put it up on the screen for the public here.",103,,
570,0.97,3933.929,3945.508,"So let's start with Lish Whitson from central staff just about the underlying bill, if there are any opening comments that you have before the presentation from Sdot.",103,,
571,0.97,3945.508,3949.979,Just a tiny bit of context.,104,,
572,0.97,3949.979,3955.117,This bill would authorize increases of parking rates related to large events.,104,,
573,0.97,3955.117,3977.606,"The code delegates authority to Sdot to set On-Street parking rates and currently has a cap of $5 an hour for On-Street parking, and this would increase the authority for parking rates related to large events up to $12 an hour.",104,,
574,0.97,3977.606,3977.907,Thank you.,104,,
575,0.97,3977.907,3984.18,I know Sdot works hard to use this and set those rates frequently to enable On-Street parking.,104,,
576,0.97,3984.18,3989.985,So want to just set that context that Sdot works really hard on these rates.,104,,
577,0.97,3989.985,3995.758,This is going--this bill would go beyond the current authority.,104,,
578,0.97,3995.758,3997.56,"So go ahead, Sdot, if you like.",104,,
579,0.97,3997.56,4003.866,"Welcome, and we look forward to your presentation.",104,,
580,0.97,4003.866,4004.834,Great.,105,,
581,0.97,4004.834,4005.001,Fu.,105,,
582,0.97,4005.001,4011.741,"I will start, my name is mark, I am the manager of curbside management at Fdot.",105,,
583,0.97,4011.741,4018.881,"And as the presentation comes up, I just want to say a couple things at the outset in response to recent media.",105,,
584,0.97,4018.881,4020.983,We'll cover these more into detail into the presentation.,105,,
585,0.97,4020.983,4025.354,"It's a short one, but just want to make sure we make a couple points at the top.",105,,
586,0.97,4025.354,4035.765,"First, this plan and this legislation is really the outgrowth of a couple years of work, a lot of work with the community, with the uptown alliance.",105,,
587,0.97,4035.765,4040.936,Wanted to say for their supportive comments as well as the climate pledge arena.,105,,
588,0.97,4040.936,4047.143,"We have mailed planned documents to over 10,000 people on four separate occasions.",105,,
589,0.97,4047.143,4051.847,We've left 800 door hangers and a lot of other individual briefings.,105,,
590,0.97,4051.847,4058.554,"So this really is an outgrowth of a lot of work for a couple of years by a whole lot of people, a lot of really intense engagement with the community.",105,,
591,0.97,4058.554,4069.198,"A second point I just want to make at the top, there are a lot of numbers flying around and math flying around in the media a little bit.",105,,
592,0.97,4069.198,4073.702,The legislation does change the cap for event rate On-Street paid parking hourly rates.,105,,
593,0.97,4073.702,4078.34,Right now the cap is $5 an hour for us to charge for On-Street paid parking.,105,,
594,0.97,4078.34,4081.077,This would lift the cap for events to $12 an hour.,105,,
595,0.97,4081.077,4088.417,"However, I want to make very clear that our intent in October when the arena opens is not to charge $12 an hour.",105,,
596,0.97,4088.417,4102.731,"Our plan is to start with a progressive rate structure, and again, we'll go into that in more detail in a few slides, but for those that are just staying in the uptown area for a couple hours, they would only pay $3 an hour.",105,,
597,0.97,4102.731,4111.14,"It's for those final three hours if you risk to stay for three or four or five hours, we're proposing to charge $8 an hour for those last three hours.",105,,
598,0.97,4111.14,4113.109,So I just want to make that clear.,105,,
599,0.97,4113.109,4121.15,And we can do a little math further into the presentation about what that means for someone who is staying for something like four hours for an arena event.,105,,
600,0.97,4121.15,4125.888,"But outside of event days, our regular On-Street paid parking rates will apply.",105,,
601,0.97,4125.888,4128.724,In update right now that's 50 cents an hour.,105,,
602,0.97,4128.724,4135.798,"The next point I want to make is we obviously want folks to take transit where they can, to bike, to walk to events at the arena.",105,,
603,0.97,4135.798,4141.47,But we also understand people will drive to other arena events.,105,,
604,0.97,4141.47,4146.775,There are a lot of Off-Street parking options in the neighborhood.,105,,
605,0.97,4146.775,4147.943,Some of those are private facilities.,105,,
606,0.97,4147.943,4150.746,The Seattle center operates a number of facilities.,105,,
607,0.97,4150.746,4153.749,"Some of those will be Reservable, whether private or Seattle center.",105,,
608,0.97,4153.749,4163.826,I was just looking today and realized I could actually Reserve my Off-Street parking for concerts in March of 2022 today.,105,,
609,0.97,4163.826,4170.766,There are also Off-Street parking options downtown right near where the Monorail ends at West Lake.,105,,
610,0.97,4170.766,4174.103,And that's just a 90-Second ride from West Lake to Seattle center.,105,,
611,0.97,4174.103,4182.244,So there are a lot of other options Besides folks trying to drive into the neighborhood and circle around for that cheap On- Street parking which is what we're trying to prevent.,105,,
612,0.97,4182.244,4194.924,"The final point I want to make, and I think this will be covered in the proposed amendment is that this really is specific to the climate pledge arena and our work over the past couple years there.",105,,
613,0.97,4194.924,4204.433,We don't have any intent anytime in the near future to event paid parking rates at areas around the Stadiums and the Soto and Pioneer square and the Chinatown International district there.,105,,
614,0.97,4204.433,4213.709,"If we were to do that at some point in the future, we would obviously engage in a super robust outreach effort with neighborhood businesses, representatives and others.",105,,
615,0.97,4213.709,4221.183,"So I know that would be covered again a little bit later on, but wanted to reinforce this up top that this really is specific to the uptown area.",105,,
616,0.97,4221.183,4233.362,"With that, I will let Ruth Harper on our team go ahead with the next few slides and provide a little bit of context for what we're proposing here today.",105,,
617,0.97,4233.362,4233.596,Hi.,106,,
618,0.97,4233.596,4235.264,Thank you.,106,,
619,0.97,4235.264,4242.771,"My name is Ruth Harper, and good morning to everybody, and thank you, Mike, for that great introduction.",106,,
620,0.97,4242.771,4250.079,So this slide really highlights the center of this effort which is a remodeled arena that is opening in October.,106,,
621,0.97,4250.079,4257.886,"And we want to support the neighborhood and also support access for residents, businesses and visitors.",106,,
622,0.97,4257.886,4261.123,There are new transit and bike lanes being installed right now.,106,,
623,0.97,4261.123,4280.709,"We are working with the arena and Seattle center staff to create a plan to manage ride Hailing services such as Lyft and Uber, and one of the highlights of this plan also includes mitigating traffic when there are events at the arena with over 10,000 attendees.",106,,
624,0.97,4280.709,4288.584,And of course it's really vital that all of this is in place before the arena opens.,106,,
625,0.97,4288.584,4289.318,"Next slide, please.",106,,
626,0.97,4289.318,4302.498,"So on May 24th we released a curb space plan with expanded restricted parking zone that's for residents, permit parking and expanded paid parking to support the business district.",106,,
627,0.97,4302.498,4310.939,"And we are currently working with businesses to ensure that their loading needs are met, as well as adding disabled parking.",106,,
628,0.97,4310.939,4320.849,"As Mike said, we're here today to discuss legislation regarding event rates for arena events with over 10,000 anticipated attendees.",106,,
629,0.97,4320.849,4330.726,But I would like to give you a quick summary of the rest of the curb space plan which we've been working on for a long time.,106,,
630,0.97,4330.726,4331.36,"So next slide, please.",106,,
631,0.97,4331.36,4335.431,And so here's a map because maps are helpful.,106,,
632,0.97,4335.431,4340.235,"This is the uptown neighborhood, and I just want to talk a little bit about the slide that you're looking at.",106,,
633,0.97,4340.235,4348.444,"And so when you look at the slide, you see lots of things, but primarily blue and orange.",106,,
634,0.97,4348.444,4360.889,"And so where you see a solid orange line, that's where we have restricted parking zone parking right now, that's zone 13 for residents, and that has been in place for many years.",106,,
635,0.97,4360.889,4370.532,"And where you see solid blue lines, that's where we have paid parking in existence today, and that has also been in place for many years.",106,,
636,0.97,4370.532,4379.041,"So where you see the shaded orange, that is where we are going to be expanding the restricted parking zone for residents.",106,,
637,0.97,4379.041,4390.619,"And so what that means is that if you're a resident, you can get a permit to Park, and you can Park there for longer than a two-hour time limit between the hours of 7:00 A.M.",106,,
638,0.97,4390.619,4391.587,And 6:00 P.M.,106,,
639,0.97,4391.587,4397.025,Seven days a week and that you need a permit to park between 6:00 P.M.,106,,
640,0.97,4397.025,4398.327,And midnight seven days a week.,106,,
641,0.97,4398.327,4407.302,So you cannot park without a permit on the Orange blocks and in those shaded orange areas where we're expanding the Rpz.,106,,
642,0.97,4407.302,4411.306,"And the paid parking, again, is on the blue solid blocks.",106,,
643,0.97,4411.306,4427.556,"And we are expanding that into the areas that you see in blue, and those are primarily commercial and retail locations where there's certainly commercial and retail at the ground level and office buildings, things like that.",106,,
644,0.97,4427.556,4448.11,"And so we are proposing that the event rates would take place or would be charged on those blocks with paid parking, again, only when there are events at the arena with greater than 10,000 anticipated attendees.",106,,
645,0.97,4448.11,4459.822,"And then this map also shows the bike lanes and transit lanes and bus routes, and I know it's a lot on one map.",106,,
646,0.97,4459.822,4460.989,"Next slide, please.",106,,
647,0.97,4460.989,4466.695,So this again really just highlights the support that we've had and some of the outreach that we've done.,106,,
648,0.97,4466.695,4476.104,"We've done outreach, as Mike said, for years, working with the uptown alliance in particular since 2017.",106,,
649,0.97,4476.104,4487.85,"We've done targeted outreach starting with an initial survey, in September a draft proposal, in December restricted parking zone hearing in March and then a final plan Mailer in May.",106,,
650,0.97,4487.85,4509.204,"So that's four Mailers that we've done, in addition to a lot of presentations we've made at meetings, we distributed door hangers throughout the business district, and we always do outreach with Stakeholders before any proposed changes to garner feedback and also get support.",106,,
651,0.97,4509.204,4513.575,And so we have really high support especially for our goals here.,106,,
652,0.97,4513.575,4520.749,And you can see that the second goal is to discourage arena event Goers from using area On- Street parking.,106,,
653,0.97,4520.749,4525.554,Able to access the neighborhood for other things.,106,,
654,0.97,4525.554,4536.665,We don't want the entire neighborhood to be just completely full with no way for anyone to park anywhere in the neighborhood if they're doing something Besides an event.,106,,
655,0.97,4536.665,4554.016,"And then in addition, we have 71% of people believe that the odd Street E-Event parking rates would really help limit event Goer parking and preserve access for local business customers.",106,,
656,0.97,4554.016,4555.851,And so I'm going to send this back over to Mike.,106,,
657,0.97,4555.851,4565.127,But I also want you to know that I'm happy to answer any questions later.,106,,
658,0.97,4565.127,4569.998,I've been immersed in this effort now for several years.,106,,
659,0.97,4569.998,4572.167,So thank you very much.,106,,
660,0.97,4572.167,4572.734,"Thanks, Ruth.",107,,
661,0.97,4572.734,4574.97,"Next slide, please.",107,,
662,0.97,4574.97,4578.006,"And this is our last, I believe, substantive slide.",107,,
663,0.97,4578.006,4579.274,We have a scheduled slide after this.,107,,
664,0.97,4579.274,4581.476,So this is the gist of the legislation.,107,,
665,0.97,4581.476,4590.218,"As Referenced before, again, we currently have authority in the SMC to charge between 50 cents an hour and $5 an hour.",107,,
666,0.97,4590.218,4598.927,"We've been looking and talking with few group, arena folks, looking at rates around the rest of the area to see what sort of comparable Off-Street rates might look like.",107,,
667,0.97,4598.927,4614.843,"Our job is to be completely competitive but to price in the On-Street parking in the uptown area, again, to try to prevent event Goers for circling for cheap On-Street parking and really causing a lot of congestion and parking during excuse me.",107,,
668,0.97,4614.843,4619.147,What we're proposing is a progressive rate structure as I kind of mentioned at the top.,107,,
669,0.97,4619.147,4625.754,"So, again, the idea is we want folks who are coming to the neighborhood not going to events to be able to access businesses.",107,,
670,0.97,4625.754,4630.892,"So for the first two hours, the rate would be in October when we start $3 an hour.",107,,
671,0.97,4630.892,4635.464,"For the hours three, four and five, the rate would be $8 an hour.",107,,
672,0.97,4635.464,4644.973,"So, again, if you're thinking about someone getting dinner and they're parking for two hours, that's going to be $6 for an On-Street paid parking rate.",107,,
673,0.97,4644.973,4650.879,"For someone who is at the arena for four hours, their charge is going to be $22.",107,,
674,0.97,4650.879,4656.718,"So that's the first two hours, $3 an hour, the second two hours of their stay at $8 an hour.",107,,
675,0.97,4656.718,4661.423,And then we will do what we always do with the rest of our paid parking.,107,,
676,0.97,4661.423,4669.731,"So since 2010, we've had a Data- driven system where we collect data and adjust rates accordingly.",107,,
677,0.97,4669.731,4672.901,We are looking for a industry sweet spot for 80% occupancy.,107,,
678,0.97,4672.901,4681.943,"We will take this approach in the uptown area once we start with event rates here and we'll look at transactions, we'll look at parking occupancy, and we'll see how things are going.",107,,
679,0.97,4681.943,4692.32,"Our experience over the last 10 years as we've actually adjusted rates down almost as much as we had adjusted rates up, and we really do just follow the data.",107,,
680,0.97,4692.32,4696.792,"So, again, what we're looking for here is authority to raise the rate cap to $12 an hour.",107,,
681,0.97,4696.792,4718.113,"But, again, we will start at $8 an hour as our highest rate, much like our existing On- Street paid parking rate right now coming out of Covid, as you may know, we reduced all rates to 50 cents an hour, been following the data since to adjust rates Incrementally since, not knowing how folks would recover and business districts would recover.",107,,
682,0.97,4718.113,4722.417,Our highest current On-Street hourly rate is $2.50 an hour.,107,,
683,0.97,4722.417,4723.151,It's the same theory.,107,,
684,0.97,4723.151,4730.926,"We have a rate cap, that doesn't mean we are charging the highest rate authorized by Council.",107,,
685,0.97,4730.926,4731.66,"Next slide, please.",107,,
686,0.97,4731.66,4734.262,"And so this is our last slide, just on schedule.",107,,
687,0.97,4734.262,4735.664,So much of this has been done.,107,,
688,0.97,4735.664,4739.601,It's the two years that led up to our releasing the plan in May.,107,,
689,0.97,4739.601,4743.538,We are here in July obviously considering legislation.,107,,
690,0.97,4743.538,4754.282,Our next steps are to notify residents that how they can go about obtaining restricted parking zone permits in those areas where we're extending especially.,107,,
691,0.97,4754.282,4759.554,"We have already begun the efforts to install some of those Rpz signs, On-Street paid parking areas.",107,,
692,0.97,4759.554,4763.692,That's a lot of field work and installations that will occur.,107,,
693,0.97,4763.692,4771.233,These changes in place by the time the arena opens in early October.,107,,
694,0.97,4771.233,4775.604,And I think that's it.,107,,
695,0.97,4775.604,4779.074,Happy to answer questions.,107,,
696,0.97,4779.074,4779.441,Thank you.,108,,
697,0.97,4779.441,4812.107,"And I think this would be a good time to talk about the amendment because it's important to note even though this is the research has been done by Sdot in the uptown area, the bill as its written technically would apply to other large events throughout the city, even though Sdot would do additional engagement, the legislative authority is for the city, so I think this amendment will address that.",108,,
698,0.97,4812.107,4817.412,Also I do understand that Councilmember Lewis does support the bill for uptown.,108,,
699,0.97,4817.412,4828.79,"So I know that's important to a lot of us to make sure that district Councilmembers, you know, where they stand on it so he is supportive, as I understand it.",108,,
700,0.97,4828.79,4849.444,"But, Lish, if you don't mind, you and Councilmember Morales going through your amendment, unless you could show it on your screen, Councilmember Morales could address, however you want to panel it, Councilmember Morales, thank you for introducing this amendment.",108,,
701,0.97,4849.444,4850.779,Sure.,109,,
702,0.97,4850.779,4855.317,Should I share my screen?,109,,
703,0.97,4855.317,4858.787,"Yes, thank you.",110,,
704,0.97,4858.787,4862.691,Can you see that?,111,,
705,0.97,4862.691,4862.924,Great.,111,,
706,0.97,4862.924,4864.593,So I'll walk through this really briefly.,111,,
707,0.97,4864.593,4878.073,"The idea is to focus the bill on Seattle center and events happening at Seattle center, not just at the arena, but other large events that occur at the center.",111,,
708,0.97,4878.073,4888.783,So at first takes up the last recital which talks about other large Stadiums or arenas.,111,,
709,0.97,4888.783,4902.43,"It AMENDS the definition of large event to be a large Seattle center event and expected to draw at least 10,000 people to Seattle center.",111,,
710,0.97,4902.43,4923.451,"Looking at this right now, I would suggest an amendment to the title of this section to be large-scale center event as well, something we missed in drafting.",111,,
711,0.97,4923.451,4940.201,The next section is--allows for the rates to increase to $12 an hour and it clarifies that it's for large-scale center events and allows for the parking changes to be implemented within a mile of Seattle center.,111,,
712,0.97,4940.201,4947.008,That's an area that extends North to McGraw at the top of Queen Anne Hill.,111,,
713,0.97,4947.008,4956.251,It extends up to Capitol Hill and South to University street in the heart of downtown Seattle.,111,,
714,0.97,4956.251,4967.529,"So it captures most areas where people would be walking from street parking, On-Street parking spaces to Seattle center events.",111,,
715,0.97,4967.529,4979.741,And then the other section is just amended to include the word Seattle center in between large and events.,111,,
716,0.97,4979.741,4997.993,"And committee members circulated earlier this morning, of course just walk on amendments at the committee stage, so thank you for having it drafted and circulated, and Councilmember Morales, if you'd like to speak.",111,,
717,0.97,4997.993,4999.327,Sure.,112,,
718,0.97,4999.327,4999.561,Thanks.,112,,
719,0.97,4999.561,5000.929,"Thank you, Lish.",112,,
720,0.97,5000.929,5001.296,Appreciate it.,112,,
721,0.97,5001.296,5028.556,"So as chair Pedersen mentioned, the language as drafted now, it does include that--you know, this application could be applied to other Venue locations such as the Soto sports Stadium, and we--my office has heard concerns from community members in the Cid on the legislation, its potential impacts on people living and working in the neighborhood.",112,,
722,0.97,5028.556,5048.076,"And so I did ask Lish to draft this because I think that before implementing anything beyond the original uptown proposal, Sdot really does need to do the extensive--a similar kind of extensive community engagement with folks living and working in the Cid and Pioneer square.",112,,
723,0.97,5048.076,5086.981,"I do want to say that I am fully committed to moving our city away from a dependence on driving, supporting more robust Multi-Modal networks and Prioritizing public transportation and--[inaudible] But I firmly believe that folks in the Cid have as much right to set the terms for their neighborhood rates as the folks in lower Queen Anne, especially given that pid has historically been left out of conversations about what's happening in their neighborhood, development of the King Dome, the T-Mobile Park, Leumin field, the streetcar.",112,,
724,0.97,5086.981,5089.25,These could all be considered community benefits.,112,,
725,0.97,5089.25,5094.589,Folks in the Cid feel like their voices weren't heard when those conversations were happening.,112,,
726,0.97,5094.589,5105.333,"So for that reason, I did ask central staff to draft this amendment, this particular legislation and would ask my committee colleagues to support it.",112,,
727,0.97,5105.333,5125.753,"And I do want to also say that I may be very supportive of parking changes around Stadiums in the Cid, in the Pioneer square area, but only after folks in those neighborhoods have had the opportunity to be engaged by the city as extensively as the folks in lower Queen Anne were.",112,,
728,0.97,5125.753,5129.991,That is all I have.,112,,
729,0.97,5129.991,5132.36,"Thank you, Councilmember Morales.",113,,
730,0.97,5132.36,5133.828,Council President Gonzalez.,113,,
731,0.97,5133.828,5145.206,"Thank you, chair Pedersen, and thank you, Councilmember Morales, for that framing of the intent behind this particular amendment.",114,,
732,0.97,5145.206,5162.49,"I have a question for the folks from Sdot which is really about, you know, why this legislation was transmitted in its original form in the first place.",114,,
733,0.97,5162.49,5189.45,"In other words, did the executive take into consideration the points that were just made by Councilmember Morales or not, I just--I'm trying to get a sense of how this particular--the base bill came into being for--you know, for discussion this morning.",114,,
734,0.97,5189.45,5190.518,Excuse me.,115,,
735,0.97,5190.518,5190.885,Sure.,115,,
736,0.97,5190.885,5192.72,I'm happy to answer that.,115,,
737,0.97,5192.72,5201.563,I think our intent in drafting the legislation was aligned with what Councilmember Morales just described.,115,,
738,0.97,5201.563,5208.603,"We really, again--this came out of a couple year's discussion with folks associated with Seattle center and climate pledge arena development.",115,,
739,0.97,5208.603,5220.014,"I think in terms of when we were drafting the bill, it probably had more to do with our thinking whether we should be drafting language that was geographically specific or broader if it was in the SMC.",115,,
740,0.97,5220.014,5233.561,I think the amendments described here are totally in keeping with and consistent with where we want to be as a department in terms of our needing to engage with those neighborhoods well in advance of any kind of consideration of something similar there.,115,,
741,0.97,5233.561,5244.238,I actually spoke with representatives of the Cid and Pioneer square last week as well in response to some of their concerns.,115,,
742,0.97,5244.238,5246.975,They both have representatives of our curb space access.,115,,
743,0.97,5246.975,5259.487,"And it's important for us to have those kinds of conversations with them, and I think--again, these amendments are responsive to their concerns and where we want to be and our intent going forward.",115,,
744,0.97,5259.487,5263.891,So I don't think it was anything intentional.,115,,
745,0.97,5263.891,5275.803,"It was more probably philosophically just drafting something that was a little broader more than geographically specific, but I think these amendments make a lot of sense.",115,,
746,0.97,5275.803,5278.306,Thank you.,116,,
747,0.97,5278.306,5279.173,Thank you.,117,,
748,0.97,5279.173,5280.842,"Colleagues, let's handle some parliamentary procedure here.",117,,
749,0.97,5280.842,5285.58,I'll go ahead and move the bill to get it on the table officially.,117,,
750,0.97,5285.58,5286.014,We'll second that.,117,,
751,0.97,5286.014,5291.552,And then we'll go ahead and move this amendment from Councilmember Morales.,117,,
752,0.97,5291.552,5306.934,"So Councilmembers, I now move that the committee recommend approval of bill 120115, item four on our agenda.",117,,
753,0.97,5306.934,5308.102,Is there a second?,117,,
754,0.97,5308.102,5308.703,Second.,118,,
755,0.97,5308.703,5309.17,Thank you.,119,,
756,0.97,5309.17,5313.908,It's been moved and Seconded to recommend passage of the bill.,119,,
757,0.97,5313.908,5316.744,We have discussed amendment 1 from Councilmember Morales.,119,,
758,0.97,5316.744,5328.456,It was circulated to Committee and presented on the screen here with the one change that Lish from central staff mentioned just adding the word Seattle center into the title.,119,,
759,0.97,5328.456,5339.267,It's throughout the amendment that this is referring to large Seattle center events only for this bill and that amendment.,119,,
760,0.97,5339.267,5343.104,"So Councilmember Morales, would you like to move your amendment?",119,,
761,0.97,5343.104,5359.954,I any final comments on the amendment?,120,,
762,0.97,5359.954,5362.79,Council President Gonzalez?,120,,
763,0.97,5362.79,5377.405,"I just want to make sure that this amendment does not require a change to the bill title, so in other words, this amendment does not impact the bill title.",121,,
764,0.97,5377.405,5387.381,We can go ahead and move forward without worrying about needing another procedural step around the title of the bill.,121,,
765,0.97,5387.381,5388.182,"Is that correct, Lish?",121,,
766,0.97,5388.182,5398.326,"That is my understanding, they can be Overinclusive, but not Underinclusive, so this is within the scope.",122,,
767,0.97,5398.326,5407.435,"Thank you, I wanted to make sure that was clear for the record since we're going from a citywide perspective to a smaller geographic Footprint on this piece of legislation.",123,,
768,0.97,5407.435,5410.938,Thank you.,123,,
769,0.97,5410.938,5415.209,"Thank you, Council President.",124,,
770,0.97,5415.209,5424.685,"It has been moved and Seconded to amend the bill with amendment one from Councilmember 1025, so any final comments on the bill itself?",124,,
771,0.97,5424.685,5433.06,Will the clerk please call the role on adoption of amendment one?,124,,
772,0.97,5433.06,5433.528,Gonzalez.,125,,
773,0.97,5433.528,5434.629,Yes.,126,,
774,0.97,5434.629,5437.965,Herbold.,127,,
775,0.97,5437.965,5438.366,Yes.,128,,
776,0.97,5438.366,5438.8,Gonzalez.,129,,
777,0.97,5438.8,5439.734,Yes.,130,,
778,0.97,5439.734,5444.639,Strauss.,131,,
779,0.97,5444.639,5444.872,Yes.,132,,
780,0.97,5444.872,5445.473,Chair Pedersen.,133,,
781,0.97,5445.473,5446.774,Yes.,134,,
782,0.97,5446.774,5450.444,The motion carries on the amendment is adopted.,135,,
783,0.97,5450.444,5463.558,"In terms of final comments on this amendment bill, I suggest that we will vote on it today and it will appear on the agenda on July 26 and the reason is, the media coverage.",135,,
784,0.97,5463.558,5468.596,We did talk to some small businesses in the uptown area.,135,,
785,0.97,5468.596,5480.808,"They were not aware of the change, so it will enable a little bit more time for the amendment bill to be available for public comment as it approaches the full city council for final consideration.",135,,
786,0.97,5480.808,5488.749,The July 26 full city council meeting is fine in terms of the timing.,135,,
787,0.97,5488.749,5490.117,10 days for the Mayor to sign.,135,,
788,0.97,5490.117,5492.787,Still well before the October target dates.,135,,
789,0.97,5492.787,5497.425,We will let it stay out a little bit longer.,135,,
790,0.97,5497.425,5500.928,"July 26, full council.",135,,
791,0.97,5500.928,5504.131,Councilmember Herbold.,135,,
792,0.97,5504.131,5505.733,Thanks.,136,,
793,0.97,5505.733,5512.573,"I did have, specifically about public awareness of the changes.",136,,
794,0.97,5512.573,5519.213,I don't mean in the context of our legislative process and prior to actually implementing.,136,,
795,0.97,5519.213,5531.158,I am more asking how people seeking to park in this area will know about the parking rates?,136,,
796,0.97,5531.158,5547.909,"So when they pull up their car to park in this designated area, where the rates are higher, after a couple of hours, how will they know before leaving their vehicle that there is this increased rate?",136,,
797,0.97,5547.909,5555.149,"I am happy to start that and if you want to fill in after that, feel free.",137,,
798,0.97,5555.149,5555.95,A few things.,137,,
799,0.97,5555.95,5563.691,One is all of the marketing and communication that will happen with the Uptick to attend events.,137,,
800,0.97,5563.691,5570.798,I know the folks at climate change arena are very in tuned with what that will look like.,137,,
801,0.97,5570.798,5576.07,"Transit, other ways to access the arena.",137,,
802,0.97,5576.07,5585.813,"They are developing partnerships to facilitate use of the Monorail, so I think a pretty heavy marketing effort with folks attending events as part of that.",137,,
803,0.97,5585.813,5591.319,The other thing on our side that we spent a lot of time on is how do we communicate with the person?,137,,
804,0.97,5591.319,5593.12,It includes a variety of things.,137,,
805,0.97,5593.12,5596.591,Messaging with the stations themselves.,137,,
806,0.97,5596.591,5603.698,They are Digital Kiosks and will have information they can give the folks.,137,,
807,0.97,5603.698,5608.536,Pay by phone is another option for parking on the street and Messaging with that.,137,,
808,0.97,5608.536,5618.546,"We spent a fair amount of time working on updated sign design, trying to establish essentially what you are describing, Councilmember Herbold.",137,,
809,0.97,5618.546,5626.954,"What are the signals we can give them with the real estate we have available on the sign to let them know if this is an event day, the rate might be different.",137,,
810,0.97,5626.954,5637.031,"We won't post the rates on the signs, but the signs will be updated in a way that looks different in this neighborhood that says on event days, you need to realize there are event rates in place.",137,,
811,0.97,5637.031,5640.868,That will move them to look at pay by phone or the pay station for those rates.,137,,
812,0.97,5640.868,5665.493,"I am just thinking about when you use the pay stations and you hit that plus sign, I am imagining it is $.50 per hour as you are hitting it and once you go over the number of hours where it is $.50 and then you hit it that one time and then, bang.",138,,
813,0.97,5665.493,5668.696,"Yeah, thank you so much.",138,,
814,0.97,5668.696,5678.406,The pay stations and pay by phone are different in the way that you can have more ability with pay by phone to choose.,139,,
815,0.97,5678.406,5681.709,You can change from minutes to hours.,139,,
816,0.97,5681.709,5683.711,You can do that on the pay by phone App.,139,,
817,0.97,5683.711,5686.781,"On the pay station, we have worked with our vendor.",139,,
818,0.97,5686.781,5690.584,We are unable to have the push be more than a certain amount.,139,,
819,0.97,5690.584,5693.888,You are not going to get too high.,139,,
820,0.97,5693.888,5696.123,You'll get almost more tired of pushing.,139,,
821,0.97,5696.123,5704.732,You could push to Max time and that would jump you all the way up and then you would push backwards.,139,,
822,0.97,5704.732,5708.102,"So, to jump and see that.",139,,
823,0.97,5708.102,5716.644,The other thing I think is important is that you can always hit cancel with your pay by phone.,139,,
824,0.97,5716.644,5726.954,"You can't cancel when you are putting in coins, but there would be really no way to pay for four hours with coins.",139,,
825,0.97,5726.954,5734.528,I guess one more thing I wanted to add this we are also developing a Website that will be on that sign.,139,,
826,0.97,5734.528,5745.473,"I'm not saying everyone wants to go to a Website, but the Website will be promoted and it will have, to the best of our ability, all of the climate pledge arena events on it.",139,,
827,0.97,5745.473,5749.143,"Parking signs, hours, different ways.",139,,
828,0.97,5749.143,5753.18,We are doing our best to think about that.,139,,
829,0.97,5753.18,5754.281,Talking about that.,139,,
830,0.97,5754.281,5760.187,"So, thank you for that question.",139,,
831,0.97,5760.187,5761.222,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",140,,
832,0.97,5761.222,5766.794,Council President Gonzalez.,140,,
833,0.97,5766.794,5767.194,Thank you.,141,,
834,0.97,5767.194,5769.864,I had questions in the same vein as Councilmember Herbold.,141,,
835,0.97,5769.864,5781.408,"The scenarios that were just discussed are sort of based in Hypotheticals, where the person has already arrived on the scene and is now about to pay for it.",141,,
836,0.97,5781.408,5813.107,I like to go further upstream from that and get a better understanding of how the Department is working to educate folks before they make that decision to get in their car and drive to uptown in the first place and in particular I would like to know what role climate pledge arena is playing in also doing education and outreach and engagement.,141,,
837,0.97,5813.107,5821.448,Of patrons and visitors to their arena on game days and advance of game days.,141,,
838,0.97,5821.448,5831.826,"Because we have not done this well historically in the Stadium district, as pointed out by Councilmember Morales earlier.",141,,
839,0.97,5831.826,5838.666,I think it is important for us to have a conversation and understanding about what the arena is committed to do.,141,,
840,0.97,5838.666,5866.76,"How we are holding the arena accountable to those commitments and how we, as a city, are fulfilling our obligation to prevent people from making the decision in the first place to drive and try to park in uptown, which will still create congestion and the potential of lack of access for local economy for business.",141,,
841,0.97,5866.76,5869.196,"Again, I will probably lead the group a little bit.",142,,
842,0.97,5869.196,5875.903,Sdot has been working with folks at the arena on an arena access management plan.,142,,
843,0.97,5875.903,5881.909,A lot of that is about how we promote and get people to use modes other than driving to the neighborhood.,142,,
844,0.97,5881.909,5887.715,"This is a parking discussion, but Ideally we would like people to drive and circle and park in the neighborhood.",142,,
845,0.97,5887.715,5909.803,"This is where Ruth can probably do better than I, but the climate pledge arena folks are absolutely committed to promoting alternate ways of getting to the arena as part of their commitment I think in their transportation management plan to manage congestion and traffic to the area.",142,,
846,0.97,5909.803,5917.945,We could probably follow up with them if there is additional detail on what the individual elements of that plan look like.,142,,
847,0.97,5917.945,5929.923,I am also confident that Sdot will be working with the opening of the arena and the first game of the Kraken on an extensive marketing effort.,142,,
848,0.97,5929.923,5953.08,"Our first job is to make sure those who can get there by transit and other modes Besides driving do so and they understand those options and after that, those who drive between climate pledge arena and Sdot, we need to be as clear and communicative as possible and early enough for the understand options, so they know what they are doing before they leave the home and come to the uptown area.",142,,
849,0.97,5953.08,5955.049,This is sort of a first time thing.,142,,
850,0.97,5955.049,5960.688,In October we will probably be working out the Kinks a little bit.,142,,
851,0.97,5960.688,5968.095,"We have not had event rates before, so it is incumbent upon us to do everything we can to get it as right as possible.",142,,
852,0.97,5968.095,5975.569,"Ruth, if there is more about your conversation specific to the access management plan and climate pledge arena, you can talk about that.",142,,
853,0.97,5975.569,5995.923,"Well, I know that when you buy your ticket, you are going to get an Email basically offering you, you know, if you want to drive, here are the options that you have and it will even have a Drop-Down menu where you are coming from.",143,,
854,0.97,5995.923,5997.725,This would be the best garage for you to choose.,143,,
855,0.97,5997.725,5998.525,And then price points.,143,,
856,0.97,5998.525,6006.9,"If you're closer, it will cost more, but if you go down to Westlake and take the free Monorail, then it would be a less expensive option for parking.",143,,
857,0.97,6006.9,6017.044,"So the whole parking reservation system is also tied into how you would access that, so that there would be less traffic.",143,,
858,0.97,6017.044,6018.512,They are looking at both of those things.,143,,
859,0.97,6018.512,6031.859,"You will get a package when you buy your ticket and I know for the subscribers, a lot of them already reserved their parking at the premium garage that came with their packages.",143,,
860,0.97,6031.859,6048.075,"So it is a big, big part of the effort, in terms of what the arena is doing and how we are working with the arena to minimize traffic, but I don't think I am answering your question, Councilmember Gonzalez.",143,,
861,0.97,6048.075,6052.579,"No, I think you are, I just don't like the answer.",144,,
862,0.97,6052.579,6070.464,"I think we are still making it really easy for people to get in their cars, particularly for those who are wealthy, to get in their cars and can just our streets and that has been a primary concern of mine as it relates to this deal from the Get-Go.",144,,
863,0.97,6070.464,6078.806,I guess what I'm trying to get a sense of is what are we doing to make it harder for people?,144,,
864,0.97,6078.806,6083.143,"Incentivizing people to not get in their cars and pay exorbitant parking rates in the first place, right?",144,,
865,0.97,6083.143,6091.819,Maybe it is because the rates are too low and if that is the case I want to know how we are going to figure that out.,144,,
866,0.97,6091.819,6102.396,I know we have said we will follow the data to see that we are producing outcome that we want and the outcome we want is not reserve your parking spot in advance.,144,,
867,0.97,6102.396,6111.238,It is don't drive to uptown and congested neighboring communities and the uptown community with vehicle parking.,144,,
868,0.97,6111.238,6124.518,Sort of Encumbering naturally occurring access to that business district by residents and usual patrons who are not partaking in the events.,144,,
869,0.97,6124.518,6137.965,"So I am just sort of struggling with how we are meeting that goal, if the arena is going to be focused on making it as easy as possible for people to drive in.",144,,
870,0.97,6137.965,6150.544,I do want to say that is part of the arena access management plan there is a mode share requirement in the plan and they have to meet certain requirements.,145,,
871,0.97,6150.544,6154.414,I think starting off it is no more than 55% of attendees are using a private vehicle to get there.,145,,
872,0.97,6154.414,6163.29,"And those get stronger and stronger, or you know, the share changes as the years go by.",145,,
873,0.97,6163.29,6172.666,That is something that is in the transportation management plan and a big part of our work and the climate pledge arena folks have to meet that.,145,,
874,0.97,6172.666,6176.703,It is certainly a big part of what they are doing.,145,,
875,0.97,6176.703,6189.55,"I was answering that in terms of parking, thinking reserving versus on street, but it is a huge part of the effort, to have people.",145,,
876,0.97,6189.55,6200.093,"We have brand-new transit lanes that are 24/7 transit, specifically as part of the arena that Sdot said to the arena, you have to put these in and fund them.",145,,
877,0.97,6200.093,6208.001,So the arena is really focused on that.,145,,
878,0.97,6208.001,6209.002,So I hope that helps some.,145,,
879,0.97,6209.002,6211.438,"Yeah, and I appreciate everything.",146,,
880,0.97,6211.438,6231.358,I know that you all have been working very hard to try to implement many of the prior legislative actions we have taken to address the realities of trafficked impact and to mitigate against the neighborhood impact as a result of having this major event center in a residential neighborhood.,146,,
881,0.97,6231.358,6250.377,"I guess what I was wanting to get a sense of and maybe I will be more laser focused in my question, was how does this piece of legislation advance the collective goal to reduce and mitigate impacts of traffic congestion?",146,,
882,0.97,6250.377,6255.082,"In other words, I know that the rates are set.",146,,
883,0.97,6255.082,6257.951,I understand where the rates are.,146,,
884,0.97,6257.951,6272.966,"And the question to me is, how is the Department planning to evaluate, once it is implemented, whether the rates are having the intended effect?",146,,
885,0.97,6272.966,6275.602,Mike?,147,,
886,0.97,6275.602,6289.816,"Right, so if we did not have this legislation in effect, then the current status of uptown paid parking is that the existing on Street rate is $0.50 per hour.",148,,
887,0.97,6289.816,6294.921,"I believe, 8:00 P.M.",148,,
888,0.97,6294.921,6301.428,That Incentivizes folks to come in and drive and find every last free parking spot they can in a neighborhood to go to a game.,148,,
889,0.97,6301.428,6314.307,"The legislation allows us to more effectively price and do something we haven't done, which is go higher than the current cap on event days to Disincentivize people from driving.",148,,
890,0.97,6314.307,6327.654,"The current time is four hours for a lot of reasons, including the Seattle center is there and we want people to be able to enjoy time at the Seattle center on Nonevent days, as well.",148,,
891,0.97,6327.654,6344.471,"But we tried to price the parking so that folks who come in to the District for a short stay, we are trying to Disincentivize longer stays through the higher on Street rate in those hours and the way we measure is the way we have come a combination of looking at transactions.",148,,
892,0.97,6344.471,6354.047,"Both numbers and duration of transactions to see, people are parking for shorter durations, that is probably good.",148,,
893,0.97,6354.047,6360.554,"If streets are full and people are parking for five hours, that is probably not what we want to see, so we adjust accordingly.",148,,
894,0.97,6360.554,6373.166,"That could lead to a combination of changing the parking rate, which is straightforward, or it could be Revisiting time limits and things like that and saying it is a combination of event and Nonevent if time limits are appropriate.",148,,
895,0.97,6373.166,6377.804,So those are a couple of the tools we have to work with.,148,,
896,0.97,6377.804,6399.126,"Okay, and for the Micro adjustments you described, changing the time limit or increasing the rate, are those things done unilaterally by the executive once we pass this ordinance or are those items that the executive would need to return to the city Council to receive authorization to achieve?",149,,
897,0.97,6399.126,6402.195,We have existing authority to adjust rates.,150,,
898,0.97,6402.195,6411.538,"When you think about paid parking currently throughout the city, we adjust the rates between $.50 and five dollars per hour, based on the data.",150,,
899,0.97,6411.538,6425.552,"We go through a notification and engagement process with the signing board and for business districts, getting rate adjustments, we engage with them, but we otherwise to have the authority to make those adjustments.",150,,
900,0.97,6425.552,6426.753,The same with time limits.,150,,
901,0.97,6426.753,6432.826,"We have the ability to adjust time limits for parking Úthroughout the city, where it makes sense.",150,,
902,0.97,6432.826,6447.474,"And do you all, in your thinking around implementation here, I am assuming you have an implementation plan or evaluation plan that is guiding the work.",151,,
903,0.97,6447.474,6458.852,"In terms of the evaluation that you are describing, of, you know, is everybody still sort of parking here or not?",151,,
904,0.97,6458.852,6478.371,"Is that work going to happen within a typical Timeframe and how do we, as Councilmembers, get a report back or understanding of what the other evaluation is telling you or what trends are identified as result of this legislation?",151,,
