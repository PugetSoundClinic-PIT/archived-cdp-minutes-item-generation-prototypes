158,0.97,1140.672,1141.106,I can pause there.,12,,

162,0.97,1144.643,1149.281,"Thank you, director Tingly.",14,,
163,0.97,1149.281,1150.582,It's great to see you here in this capacity.,14,,
164,0.97,1150.582,1153.418,Things for joining us for the first committee meeting of the year.,14,,
165,0.97,1153.418,1157.089,I want to jump in a little bit to the FEMA reimbursement.,14,,
166,0.97,1157.089,1167.466,And the ever extending deadline and for FEMA reimbursement on Non-Congregant shelter.,14,,
167,0.97,1167.466,1175.274,"We have routinely seen that deadline extending .. my understanding is currently it extends to April, though I might not be completely Up-To- date.",14,,
168,0.97,1175.274,1182.848,"I would presume, given the new variant and everything else, that FEMA will probably extend the deadline yet again.",14,,
169,0.97,1182.848,1212.778,"I just raise it to ask, you know, as we enter it . a new administration and there is some possibilities to seek some ongoing reimbursement for Non- Congregant shelter and there is obviously a mass need and Mayor Harrell campaigned aggressively on standing on 2000 Non- Congregant units what some of our strategies might be to pursue this.",14,,
170,0.97,1212.778,1230.829,"Article from discussions last spring that, really, what it came down to was a risk decision based on our liquidity and based on our assumptions and how long the reimbursement would proceed and what it wind down might look like ..",14,,
171,0.97,1230.829,1255.854,"Also, that there would be some services that would not be eligible for the ultimate FEMA reimbursement where we would have to find other ways to pay for those services as a component . But, I do think given that deadline continues to extend, you know, I remain of the opinion that I think we should lean into that in a bigger way.",14,,
172,0.97,1255.854,1256.388,As a city.,14,,
173,0.97,1256.388,1257.055,As part of our strategy here.,14,,
174,0.97,1257.055,1261.76,I guess I just wonder what the current discussion is around that?,14,,
175,0.97,1261.76,1263.562,What the current Timeline is?,14,,
176,0.97,1263.562,1284.65,And if my information is out of date and how we might work together to lean into that a little bit more as policymakers here at the Mayor's office and the council as we look at all of our options to confront homelessness and lean into Non- Congregant solutions.,14,,
177,0.97,1284.65,1286.118,"Thank you for the question, council member Louis ..",15,,
178,0.97,1286.118,1286.652,It's a great one ..,15,,
179,0.97,1286.652,1291.89,Your memory is excellent . that is precisely where we left off.,15,,
180,0.97,1291.89,1336.968,"That is my understanding as well . as a current Timeline for FEMA . I will tell you that at a high-level we are not leaving any dollars on the table . Our Office of emergency management is routine meeting without a promise to review Covid expenditures, to ensure that we are capturing any FEMA eligible costs and submitting them for reimbursement . This is a new administration, so you can imagine all sort of resources and ideas are on the table to figure out how we can tackle this moving forward I don't have any additional information I can provide you at this moment, but can certainly follow-up once we have a chance to dig in and explore those options more thoroughly.",15,,
181,0.97,1336.968,1337.569,I present that.,16,,
182,0.97,1337.569,1339.004,Thank you so much.,16,,
183,0.97,1339.004,1345.41,I have a follow-up question to break it down a little bit.,17,,
184,0.97,1345.41,1346.578,"Councilmember Lewis, maybe this is for you or Julie.",17,,
185,0.97,1346.578,1357.322,"When you say lean in, what does that mean?",17,,
186,0.97,1357.322,1358.59,Was I the one that used the word Linick?,18,,
187,0.97,1358.59,1361.66,I want to make sure that that,18,,
188,0.97,1361.66,1364.93,I think you did use it a few times.,19,,
189,0.97,1364.93,1374.473,"Well, Okay, I guess I can explain what I meant by that.",20,,
190,0.97,1374.473,1392.457,"Maybe this would be a follow-up for the director . I don't want to Belabor this at this point, but my understanding is what that conversation last spring really came down to was we were having a lot of disagreement in public, but it was about the Semantics of, sort of, the same Sandbox.",20,,
191,0.97,1392.457,1394.192,"We were all playing it in terms of these facts, right?",20,,
192,0.97,1394.192,1406.438,"It kind of came down to, you know, how much would we be willing to spend forward and wait for the Feds to eventually give it back?",20,,
193,0.97,1406.438,1408.507,"It's kind of my memory, right?",20,,
194,0.97,1408.507,1436.701,"I was personally just given, you know, how fundamental to our recovery dealing with the homelessness crisis is what was willing to, you know, kind of, spend more money and wait for the FEMA reimbursement if it meant making a material impact on homelessness, but I guess that's what I mean by lean in, Madam chair.",20,,
195,0.97,1436.701,1457.489,"It would be, essentially, some scheme where we would do some kind of Interfund loan and build more Congregant shelter and then wait for the FEMA reimbursement, even if it might take two years or three years, but it was contingent on how liquid are we?",20,,
196,0.97,1457.489,1461.092,Are we look at enough we could do something like that where it would appear on other things balanced with the uncertainty of other borrowing schemes.,20,,
197,0.97,1461.092,1468.266,"We are doing around Jumpstart and everything else, for example, right?",20,,
198,0.97,1468.266,1494.459,"So, I guess what I would be interested in looking into is, is there a way we can stretch reliance on FEMA reimbursement a little bit more given the eligibility for reimbursement keeps extending further and further out? based on what we have heard from central staff something, I don't want to speak for central staff, but a majority of the cost associated with Congregant shelter could be recouped.",20,,
199,0.97,1494.459,1530.262,"Security can be recouped, building or basic staffing of the shelter can be recouped a lot of the stuff that we are doing and for our current capacity are applying for reimbursement for but what we are currently doing is not meeting the scale of the problem, so if there is a way to take advantage of that FEMA reimbursement further to respond to the crisis, and as we have demonstrated in the report that my office put forward in October, that there is a direct correlation to Covid and the reduction of supply of shelter.",20,,
200,0.97,1530.262,1540.272,"I think we can demonstrate that before Covid we would not be investing in more Congregant shelter, which would be a contingent to get the reimbursement.",20,,
201,0.97,1540.272,1564.763,"I guess that's what I meant by lean in more, you know, if we have a clear Articulable partnership and strategy with the granted administration, which we will be talking about in my meeting this afternoon, assuming a little more risk to drive a recovery and take advantage of Federal partnership is something that I would like to pursue NC.",20,,
202,0.97,1564.763,1579.477,"And I appreciate budget office, gear, and explaining the contours of how that would work and Queuing it out for us as policymakers in terms of the risk reward of potential plans.",20,,
203,0.97,1579.477,1589.387,"That is what I meant, Madam chair probably a lot more than you were looking for in terms of context from me.",20,,
204,0.97,1589.387,1590.088,I think that is excellent.,21,,
205,0.97,1590.088,1591.256,I think it's really important to be explicit.,21,,
206,0.97,1591.256,1611.476,"I do remember these conversations . Thank you for that reminder I agree with our chair of public assets and homelessness, because I think we need to be doing exactly that, and I underscore his interest in that spirit I see Allie is off mute . please go ahead expect thank you, chair.",21,,
207,0.97,1611.476,1613.845,"Good morning, committee members.",21,,
208,0.97,1613.845,1625.757,"I just wanted to add in just a confirmation that I will work with the CBO to follow up on those conversations, and proceeding.",21,,
209,0.97,1625.757,1696.327,"I think there was some time was spent about 2020 and 2021 just getting alignment with the prior executive on where to focus our investment strategies and different policy priorities in terms of the Hoteling and that sort of thing . a lot of that has got to the ground . I think there are some opportunities to look at what was authorized and adopted in the budget and whether or not there are investments that have already been authorized, that we might seek reimbursement for that would then potentially free up those resources for yet additional services and or the other piece we need to keep in mind that we talked about a lot this November is with the extension, extension is not the right word, but the continued pandemic crisis . I think we will all be watching carefully our revenues and look at the April forecast and whether or not the continued pandemic is Impacting that there is a lot of pieces here . I would advise caution in making investment ideas until we have a better sense of the lay of the land on our current revenues and our already authorized investments.",21,,
210,0.97,1696.327,1702.934,We will note that most of this presentation focuses on the direct assistance to cities and the targeted aid from the Federal funds.,21,,
211,0.97,1702.934,1707.138,We will follow-up with additional FEMA information after the committee,21,,
212,0.97,1707.138,1714.846,"Great, thank you.",22,,
213,0.97,1714.846,1715.346,Representative Dingley.,22,,
214,0.97,1715.346,1715.847,Thank you so much.,23,,
215,0.97,1715.847,1717.282,I'm going to try to catch up on a little bit of time.,23,,
216,0.97,1717.282,1736.835,"So, on our implementation update . I wanted to talk to a little bit about the process that we had to undergo from the last time we spoke until today a lot of that impacts the rate at which we are spending some of these dollars if you were called back to last summer when we were passing that joint plan for Seattle rescue plan one.",23,,
217,0.97,1736.835,1751.75,"We had just, the day before, received what we called the interim final rule that was the term of art from the Feds, their initial guidance on how to use those funds, that $232 million.",23,,
218,0.97,1751.75,1772.403,"As CBO was charged with being proper stewards of public money, it was incumbent upon us to ensure that our planned spending was done in accordance with those guidelines .. so, we had to create from nothing.",23,,
219,0.97,1772.403,1773.571,"A review process, because the Feds didn't have one ...",23,,
220,0.97,1773.571,1798.396,"No other jurisdictions had one and we were the first in the nation to get out in front of this we created a whole process to evaluate eligibility, to set up tracking and reporting, analyze are at Jfx, sent a performance evaluation on the front end, so that we could really make sure we were tracking these investments as we were going and that all set us up to be a place where we could then implement the spending.",23,,
221,0.97,1798.396,1805.236,"So we know that, three, four, five, six, seven years now, and others from the Feds come calling.",23,,
222,0.97,1805.236,1809.24,"We had this all Well-Documented and didn't end up having to pay this back, because we didn't use it properly.",23,,
223,0.97,1809.24,1812.977,Thank you for indulging that.,23,,
224,0.97,1812.977,1813.511,We will keep going.,23,,
225,0.97,1813.511,1819.784,"I want to complement you on your staff . There was, I think, national task force.",24,,
226,0.97,1819.784,1850.982,"You have the chance to sit on to advise other cities about the process for tracking those dollars, if I remember correctly I think counsel also allocated additional staff, I'm going to look at Allie to remind me, additional staff for tracking reports and we did highlight for our congressional delegation the work that we included, so there would be a strong adherence and accountability to how those dollars are used, which I know Senator Murray, for example, who we were talking with really appreciated that inclusion.",24,,
227,0.97,1850.982,1873.104,"Thank you for the work that you have done . I wanted to pass along our thanks from the congressional delegation will also echoed their appreciation for that work . When we are on the National stage, as we often are for good reasons, this is one example of the tracking and accountability pieces we have implemented that God is national recognition",24,,
228,0.97,1873.104,1873.805,Thank you so much ..,25,,
229,0.97,1873.805,1877.408,The team is absolutely incredible.,25,,
230,0.97,1877.408,1878.643,I will pass along your thanks,25,,
231,0.97,1878.643,1900.898,"A quick note that we do have reporting requirements with the Feds on both our expenditures and our performance we are coming up on our first expenditure report due January 31st we will make sure that has to be published, I believe it has to be published . William is on the line, so he can jump in if that is not accurate at least our performance plan does have to be published.",26,,
232,0.97,1900.898,1905.47,Our next performance plan to date is may July.,26,,
233,0.97,1905.47,1906.371,Will have those coming as well ..,26,,
234,0.97,1906.371,1938.603,"In addition, counsel, you are all currently receiving a monthly update on Seattle rescue plan spending we are working with Council central staff to make sure that information is usable and useful for you . The first couple of think use for working with us and raising issues where they are and we are working to make those a little bit more helpful . I think that chair Mosqueda went over this at the top, but we split this up into three overall legislative vehicles.",26,,
235,0.97,1938.603,1973.304,"The Seattle rescue plan one, two, and 3. in each of these Rectangles we have the dollar amounts as well as the funding sources from each of those grants . It is just a quick note to say that previously we have heard a lot of conservation from the public, rightly so, because it's really hard to track how we spend our Federal dollars in 2020 we have the C.A.R.E.S act from the Feds that issued 18 different unique grants to the city . It's really hard if you are a member of the public to track how did we spend all of those dollars?",26,,
236,0.97,1973.304,2003.0,"For us to provide transparent accountability with Seattle rescue plan we endeavored to put one umbrella over all of that spending, so if you remember nothing else, remember Seattle rescue plan and when you go Online you can see how we are doing on all of that spending we have a lot more to come on public facing Websites and how we are doing on that spending and performance . It's not quite ready yet, but our current plans are up on both the Council site . There is a couple of versions, but all there.",26,,
237,0.97,2003.0,2003.668,I'm sorry to interrupt you.,27,,
238,0.97,2003.668,2012.91,"That reminded me that One.Last year, I believe it was deputy Mayor Washington, who said there was a Website underway to have one portal for applying for various grants.",27,,
239,0.97,2012.91,2014.746,Is that still works or is that,27,,
240,0.97,2014.746,2021.953,It is live.,28,,
241,0.97,2021.953,2031.562,"I have a slide on that later in the presentation, so I will go into those details when we get there, if that's all right, all right . We were going to the next ..",28,,
242,0.97,2031.562,2033.231,This is a high-level summary of how we have invested all of those dollars ..,28,,
243,0.97,2033.231,2034.932,"These are a lot of numbers, so I'm not going to read each one.",28,,
244,0.97,2034.932,2063.494,"Just to give you a general sense of how these dollars were allocated for the purposes of today, I'm going to give you limitation updates on Seattle rescue plans 1 and 2. I'm not going to endeavor to do that for Seattle rescue plan three, because if you will remember, those funds were allocated with the 2022 budgets, which just happened at the end of November with holidays and Whatnot we don't have substances updates to provide you on those today that will be the subject of future meetings.",28,,
245,0.97,2063.494,2086.217,"This is an overall spending update using those same categories of spending, I will walk you through from left to right on what all these columns mean . First, we have the allocated amount . how much did we get to this effort, whether homelessness and housing, committee well-being, or recovery . how much do they get from each of those appropriations bills last year?",28,,
246,0.97,2086.217,2090.488,How much has been spent overall from the departments?,28,,
247,0.97,2090.488,2098.963,How much has been encumbered or in process or contracted?,28,,
248,0.97,2098.963,2106.571,"Those are terms on our end, but they show up in our financial systems, thereby the next step would be reporting to you all and to the public differently.",28,,
249,0.97,2106.571,2114.846,It's really important to see that even though the spent amount is $42 million of $123 million.,28,,
250,0.97,2114.846,2139.47,"We also have $30 million in the process it's working with providers, those are almost under contract or are currently contracted, but the provider has not yet spent the money on their end that total spent in the cupboard process is a better look at what we have done to get these dollars out the door . You will see those percentages are actually quite high.",28,,
251,0.97,2139.47,2149.647,"A lot of these dollars were supposed to spend multiple years as well . It wouldn't be the case that, for example, I would expect to see 70% across the board.",28,,
252,0.97,2149.647,2155.52,I would expect there somewhat in line with the use these don't worry me at this point.,28,,
253,0.97,2155.52,2162.793,We are keeping a close eye on these we will go through some specific updates unless anybody has questions here,28,,
254,0.97,2162.793,2166.197,Not seeing any questions right now,29,,
255,0.97,2166.197,2166.998,Great.,30,,
256,0.97,2166.998,2167.765,Thank you.,30,,
257,0.97,2167.765,2179.443,Getting into our first spending highlights very exciting that our cash assistance program we are spending is Near-Complete.,30,,
258,0.97,2179.443,2180.177,This was a $25 million program.,30,,
259,0.97,2180.177,2197.328,"Overall, where we had $22 million awarded to 12,690 low income households . each of those awards was between $1000 and $3000, based on the household size overall . If you remember we had two different phases for distributing this money.",30,,
260,0.97,2197.328,2290.154,"One was to Recertify prior recipients of the Seattle disaster relief cash assistance program, which we ran previously under Covid . Those were households that wouldn't traditionally or couldn't benefit from Federal cash assistance programs, and general phase 2 of the program was a broad replication that was open for folks that was distributed to 9392 households we have considerable demand for that program, so we had almost 64,000 applications that were submitted . importantly, wanted to highlight the data on the applicants that we received 82.7% of applicants have lost a job or income as a result of Covid, 44% at the time have contracted Covid themselves 51% had experienced mental or substance abuse crisis that required medication or counseling 92% had experienced unstable housing situations 54% had no health insurance and 41% were survivors of harmful violence, 49% received no stimulus assistance 31% had a family member with a disability . This speaks to truths we already know about our community, but it's really important to highlight where these needs are showing up and how closely they actually align with where we have chosen to provide the resource at the end of the day . Obviously, the great is need a that we will ever be able to meet ..",30,,
261,0.97,2290.154,2292.49,I wanted to highlight that the Snippets we got on those applications,30,,
262,0.97,2292.49,2339.403,"Thank you for providing that data that's the first time I've heard that I appreciate you sharing that data . I also want to note this is an area in conversations with their peers cities that have looked to Seattle as a good example of how to allocate these Federal dollars . I also want to emphasize that when we talk about cash assistance when we pass the Seattle rescue plan and we negotiated this, this was our antidote to the triple down mentality . that if we invest at the top we flipped it on its head and we said we would reject that triple down approach and directly invest, especially in those who have been left out of additional assistance . I'm really Thankfu for you sharing those statistics and for the work you have done to get these dollars out the door so quickly.",31,,
263,0.97,2339.403,2340.171,Thank you for that.,32,,

269,0.97,2365.629,2377.007,"The most equitable way, can you tell us a little bit more, were all the 63,000 determined to be eligible and if so what was a priority, or how did you decide which households received assistance?",33,,

We had her there was a severe need for people people coming through food bank lines for there to be that rental assistance we try to facilitate peering committee organization so the sellers could get out the door more quickly and it was a good reminder for me, council member Peterson, I will follow up with housing and see how the partnership is going . that is what we heard, Anecdotally, so we tried to address some of that in last years budget for the community partner spending anything else to add on that?",48,,

330,0.97,2918.115,2940.504,"For those living in their cars as a reminder, half of the homeless population, half of those experiencing homelessness, live in their vehicles . that's a really important point, and with the tiny House villages, House member listed a lot of work with our legislative delegation last year to get funding directly allocated to the city of Seattle, so we can create additional tiny House villages.",55,,

332,0.97,2963.694,3032.496,"I also want to note that these are point in time, so as we were Transitioning to the regional homelessness authority moving over there, as a regional homelessness authority meeting discuss, a lot of those Earmarks are going to Faith- based entities, as the Church of greater Seattle noted in their presentation . These are meant to be continuity of services, continuity of service assurances as a regional homelessness authority stands up as I expressed to the limitation board we are all in this together and as bolder, bigger, more integrated ideas come from the regional homelessness authority and implementation committee and the more we know there will be an opportunity to streamline services with King County and I know that I am hopeful that we will see greater diversity of the revenue going into regional homelessness authority . I don't want to brag about having nearly 70% of the funding coming from Seattle, because I think it should be a diversified funding resort going into diversified homeless authority, thus the name ..",55,,

378,0.97,3408.271,3426.589,"I would add, the funding that was authorized by the, counsel was added to the human services Department alongside their program that spends dollars that are generated from the cities and zoning program that supports investments in Childcare facilities . generally speaking, that is sort of an open enrollment program.",68,,
379,0.97,3426.589,3432.629,There is a contact I can share with committee members the information Hst has available.,68,,
380,0.97,3432.629,3463.46,"If there are facilities, centers, et cetera seeking funding our first step is to reach out to the team and they could consider whether or not that my be eligible for use of incentive zoning dollars, which come with some restrictions and requirements that are slightly potentially different than the requirements of the Federal funding . In general, in the past it hasn't been an Rfp, it has been an open program and Hst staff worked with the applicants and developers along the way.",68,,
381,0.97,3463.46,3471.201,Thank you for that reminder and the rationale for why the funding was placed under Hsd versus deal.,69,,

385,0.97,3484.914,3494.624,"That was, I'm very interested in getting an answer to that too . I know when we created the Department of education and early learning all the Childcare staff was going to be over a deal.",70,,
386,0.97,3494.624,3523.152,"There was a partial FTE, I think, left over at Hsd for capital planning and it sounds like they still tightly coordinate efforts with deal, but if we are going to be adding positions it makes me question why would they not be added that deal and to bring everything under that Department . I look forward to hearing more about why they would do and Hsd",70,,

389,0.97,3553.449,3645.074,"I want to thank Senator Murray, who is also meeting with a handful of Childcare providers in Seattle soon who have received the Childcare allotment . I'm sure it's very rewarding as well for them to be able to see how these American rescue plan dollars have been passed through Seattle, the Seattle rescue plan, and have made it into the plans of their constituents as well . a lot of work went into that . I think it's a good example of where this Federal dollars are truly making a difference, not only the health and well-being of individuals, but our local economy as well . I can't get away without saying thank you to director Chapelle and Monica a Gary of the Department of education and early learning for the quick work they did to pull together Stakeholders they had a number of robust Stakeholder conversations . I think this was really informed by those on the front lines, but Childcare providers and workers themselves members of NCI United 25 and Childcare advocates who pulled together an efficient and collaborative process to get those dollars out the door again, over 3500 Childcare providers were able to receive those dollars . very exciting news for everyone and racial justice and equity assets that you noted are true of various aspects of Seattle rescue, but very prominent here in the role that Childcare providers play.",71,,

395,0.97,3698.861,3725.621,"We share that information with central staff you have that information as noted in this slide, the services are still between other youth case management and subsidies, some pieces for alleviating negative effects of isolation, such as visual skills, coaching Yeah.",73,,
396,0.97,3725.621,3755.551,"We will continue working with the rest of it as well as future allocations of that remaining two years I will know one of the issues is that because we packaged these things together into the Seattle rescue plan branding the Department was still working and waiting to get approval from the state on our plans, but also to get a more detailed guidance on how we were allowed to spend these funds at a time.",73,,
397,0.97,3755.551,3763.359,This grant was accepted that accounts for some of the delay in terms of getting things moving with contracts.,73,,

528,0.97,5279.24,5289.517,In the past we have done work to expand health coverage for all kids with apple health and have continued to work and extend health KO Raj to those without insurance.,124,,
529,0.97,5289.517,5332.26,"We have a lot to be proud of out here in the Pacific Northwest with a basic health plan that a number on this line helped to launch years ago and we have been a national leader in providing health coverage to those unable to get it through their employer and previous work I did with the Washington state labor Council, I tried to make the case and prove the point your Healthcare should not be tied to your employer and there's never been more of a pressing moment to really call out the importance of providing health insurance to everyone so no matter what your job is when whether or not you're able to keep your job or sustain keeping your employment during these times of the pandemic.",124,,
530,0.97,5332.26,5340.401,Wee have seen so many people lose their health insurance and then able to go over to the public programs to pick up health coverage.,124,,
531,0.97,5340.401,5359.287,"In fact, we saw the research center they reported last month that nearly 9 P 6 million workers in the United States lost their jobs and also along with that, their employer sponsored health insurance but the gap in terms of health insurance was mostly filled by public health coverage.",124,,
532,0.97,5359.287,5369.564,That really SETS up an important conversation about how we can continue to make sure that health coverage is available for folks regardless of their employment status or their employer.,124,,
533,0.97,5369.564,5392.653,"We also know that Disportion Únatalie those that lost their jobs were people of color and notably, women of color and Disportion Natalie those who had to keep their job and go in as essential workers, many of them didn't have health insurance and those continue to go into work and risk exposure to themselves and families as essential workers more likely to be people of color and women.",124,,
534,0.97,5392.653,5422.417,We know this is specifically true for those going in as Healthcare providers in long term care and behavioral health or in the Healthcare setting so it's been a long time coming to have a conversation about how we can continue to expand health KO Raj to those who have been kept out of public insurance because of Federal requirements around public subsidized health insurance.,124,,
535,0.97,5422.417,5444.005,In 2017 the Council President he recalled approved the consultant budget that I and others brought forward requesting $34 million on how to secure community based health insurance for immigrants.,124,,
536,0.97,5444.005,5469.797,"Nola Northwest health law has been advocating for health coverage for everyone and in 2018 they received the ability to help us understand what the--excuse me, in January 2018 Northwest health advocates came and presented about how they identified ways in which health coverage could be expanded.",124,,
537,0.97,5469.797,5491.519,They passed a resolution to support full access to Healthcare particularly for reproductive Healthcare and Undocumented immigrants and we work closely to learn from healthy San Francisco and my health La about their successful programs and in July 2018 we had a presentation at the board of health about the other jurisdictions providing health coverage to folks in the region.,124,,
538,0.97,5491.519,5510.838,Council member from King County included in their 2018 budget ways for the county to partner with public health and do an analysis of a region health plan that would be able to PR Viaduct health coverage to low income residents in the county which is really important as we think about folks who don't live in the city but may work in the city and care for folks here.,124,,
539,0.97,5510.838,5519.347,"This has been an exciting opportunity for us in the moment of Covid to talk about the ways in which we can maintain, strengthen and expand health coverage for all.",124,,
540,0.97,5519.347,5521.716,I know there's conversations happening at the state level.,124,,
541,0.97,5521.716,5528.356,We are very thrilled to have with us senior deputy he recalled with us.,124,,
542,0.97,5528.356,5535.363,Mayor he recalled made it a corner stone of his Inaugural speech to talk about the importance of health coverage for everyone in the region.,124,,
543,0.97,5535.363,5548.009,Wanted to kick it over to you and talk about the way in which you see this item folding into the current administration's priorities and then we'll turn it over to Janet for leading us off with the panel.,124,,
544,0.97,5548.009,5550.177,Thank you again senior deputy Mayor.,124,,
545,0.97,5550.177,5555.316,Thank you so much Council member Masqueda.,125,,
546,0.97,5555.316,5564.992,As you mentioned it's one of the things that you and the Mayor speak so eagerly about and that's Healthcare and Healthcare access.,125,,
547,0.97,5564.992,5570.031,It's near and dear to Mayor he recalled's heart.,125,,
548,0.97,5570.031,5595.823,"Particularly for those who don't have access to existing coverage as Council member Maskada mentioned, employer sponsored insurance is difficult when it only covers a portion of the communities particularly as we're looking at growing participants in the economy and the additional burdens on small and Micro businesses as they're looking to get off the ground and grow.",125,,
549,0.97,5595.823,5626.687,"It is really important that when you change employment status that you don't lose access to Healthcare and that everybody has access to Healthcare regardless of their immigration status because if we don't Dakota access pipeline care of our community's elderly, they will end up in emergency rooms and cost us more in terms of financial resources and impacts on the lives of our community members so this is really important work.",125,,
550,0.97,5626.687,5636.897,I want to thank our community members and our community health organizations for being here and sharing your work.,125,,
551,0.97,5636.897,5655.516,We're looking to support how we can find ways to grow your Footprint within your communities to ensure we have more Healthcare access and coverage for all Seattle so you're doing amazing work and we are thrilled to hear from you today.,125,,
552,0.97,5655.516,5655.916,Thank you so much.,125,,
553,0.97,5655.916,5659.42,Thank you very much and I'll turn it over to Janet.,126,,
554,0.97,5659.42,5669.196,"That was a year off in my analysis, you got the contract in 2018 and we were working with King county in 2019 so just before the pandemic came.",126,,
555,0.97,5669.196,5678.205,So excellent work you have done and thank you for the important work in King County.,126,,
556,0.97,5678.506,5705.266,Now is the time as senior deputy Mayor noted this is something that the mayors and Mayor's office is excited about so I'm excited to see how we can continue these conversations.,126,,
557,0.97,5705.266,5706.6,.,126,,
558,0.97,5706.6,5707.802,Thank you.,127,,
559,0.97,5707.802,5717.278,I hope everyone can see this screen.,127,,
560,0.97,5717.278,5718.612,.,127,,
561,0.97,5718.612,5720.247,This should be here.,128,,
562,0.97,5720.548,5724.952,.,128,,
563,0.97,5725.252,5725.453,Great.,129,,
564,0.97,5725.453,5735.329,Okay thank you so much for both of you for your commitment and your great explanation.,129,,
565,0.97,5735.329,5742.837,I think I can go through slides very quickly because you made a lot of points that we are thinking about.,129,,
566,0.97,5742.837,5765.159,"So I'll discuss the research and developments that we have done in 2018 and 2019 related to health equity for immigrants and my fellow panel members will talk about community needs, patient experiences and the current efforts to achieve equity at the state level.",129,,
567,0.97,5765.459,5775.703,Sorry about this.,129,,
568,0.97,5784.044,5784.411,Not sure what happened.,129,,
569,0.97,5784.712,5789.183,Got it now.,129,,
570,0.97,5791.252,5793.854,We do.,130,,
571,0.97,5793.854,5794.321,Okay all right.,131,,
572,0.97,5794.622,5820.714,What you see here is a chart of options for immigrants in Washington and the basic point is there are very limited small public programs for the clinics which provide great primary care.,132,,
573,0.97,5820.714,5824.084,But are not full health coverage.,132,,
574,0.97,5824.084,5830.524,The only folks who get full health coverage are in this gray column over here.,132,,
575,0.97,5830.524,5843.904,Programs that are restricted based on citizenship and immigration status and the two key ones in our state are apple health for adults well kids of course but we're talking about adults in this presentation.,132,,
576,0.97,5843.904,5854.849,Apple health for adults and health plans with financial help which are these qualified health plans to help benefit exchange.,132,,
577,0.97,5854.849,5867.528,The gaps in coverage are really centered around the fact that immigrants do not qualify for those two essential programs.,132,,
578,0.97,5867.528,5870.331,So they're excluded by Federal law.,132,,
579,0.97,5870.331,5874.168,We don't have a state plan to fill in the gap.,132,,
580,0.97,5874.168,5892.519,"We don't have county or city coverage to fill in the gap so people who are Undocumented and others who don't have qualifying immigration status are excluded from the programs and without them, health insurance is just Unaffordable for most people.",132,,
581,0.97,5892.82,5901.061,"It's clear that we need to address the issue of the remaining uninsured folks and note, here's some statistics.",132,,
582,0.97,5901.061,5911.372,Not going through every one but note that the insurance rate is more than double the rate for King County as a whole.,132,,
583,0.97,5911.372,5917.111,"Over 30,000 King County residents are living without coverage.",132,,
584,0.97,5917.111,5936.263,"Again, there are some limited immigration categories that qualify for coverage through the health benefit exchange but those are still requiring premium payments in cost sharing which can be hard for enrollment.",132,,
585,0.97,5936.263,5951.345,"In the past four years the board of health, city and county recognized the need to address the program and as County member Maskeda mentioned there's been a resolution by the board of health to expand KO Raj and lower barriers for immigrants.",132,,
586,0.97,5951.345,5955.115,We studied the issue of how to move forward with this.,132,,
587,0.97,5955.115,5961.622,And now with the pandemic there's an increasing focus on access to Healthcare.,132,,
588,0.97,5961.622,5972.466,We're pleased that Mayor he recalled recognized the urgency of the morning in his Inaugural address and shared his vision that in Seattle we all have Healthcare.,132,,
589,0.97,5972.466,5980.741,So I'm excited to share the work we did we to explore coverage options thanks to city council funding.,132,,
590,0.97,5980.741,5993.654,We looked at programs that already exist in other counties and we evaluated the design of these programs to make recommendations for King County and Yakima.,132,,
591,0.97,5993.654,5998.659,The programs vary in terms of benefits offered and income eligibility.,132,,
592,0.97,5998.659,6010.371,One of the most Rebust healthy San Francisco is available for residents with income under 500% of poverty who cannot qualify for public insurance programs.,132,,
593,0.97,6010.371,6017.044,"The benefits include outpatient care, lab pharmacy and more.",132,,
594,0.97,6017.044,6029.456,"For our recommendations, for King and Yakima counties we learned about the experience in the existing County based programs and we also interviewed many local safety net providers.",132,,
595,0.97,6029.456,6037.297,They all confirmed that even minimal out of pocket costs can be varied with care.,132,,
596,0.97,6037.297,6054.982,"We identified resources and gaps finding that people need access to specialty care, Raidology, lab services and therapies, dental transportation in rural areas, especially and prescription drugs.",132,,
597,0.97,6054.982,6067.961,People we interviewed here in and in other states recognize the importance of having a primary care home that can coordinate through a network of providers under contract.,132,,
598,0.97,6067.961,6073.434,They emphasize that application processes should be convenient easy to use and should not be Intimidating.,132,,
599,0.97,6073.434,6077.938,We'll hear more about that from one of our providers.,132,,
600,0.97,6077.938,6082.609,We recommended the public health Seattle King County run the program.,132,,
601,0.97,6082.609,6090.05,The King County Council expressed interest as Council member mentioned they funded a report the health Department to look at options.,132,,
602,0.97,6090.05,6111.238,And that report came up with Ochgss and cost estimates for partial coverage but ultimately they recommended instead to encourage a statewide solution as well as enhancing County Xas toy to connect people to services that they are currently eligible for.,132,,
603,0.97,6111.238,6116.176,And statewide coverage is the direction we have been going with our advocacy.,132,,
604,0.97,6116.176,6125.486,We have been pursuing comprehensive coverage on a statewide basis throughout the health equity for immigrants campaign.,132,,
605,0.97,6125.486,6142.136,This legislative session there's recognition of the importance and there's momentum to consider that approach with interests from a number of legislatures.,132,,
606,0.97,6142.803,6153.046,We have more now.,132,,
607,0.97,6154.114,6168.695,"So let's see, I am trying to keep up with what's going on here.",132,,
608,0.97,6168.695,6182.442,Turning it over to Benda but I wanted to mention if you're interested in any more information there's a slide with links to additional Info.,132,,
609,0.97,6182.442,6185.612,Thank you very much and I'll turn it over to Brenda.,132,,
610,0.97,6185.913,6191.318,.,132,,
611,0.97,6191.652,6202.095,I have the first few slides for Brenda so if you see my screen until I stop sharing after she's done talking about the slides.,133,,
612,0.97,6202.095,6210.37,"You will see me instead of Brenda, too bad because she's the presenter.",133,,
613,0.97,6210.37,6213.207,The screen will Toggle to Whoever is speaking.,134,,
614,0.97,6213.207,6222.549,So your box will not be on the screen.,134,,
615,0.97,6222.549,6227.454,Thank you and I can actually share my screen and I think it's up.,135,,
616,0.97,6227.454,6234.528,I'll just keep my Cram off so I don't freeze halfway through the presentation.,135,,
617,0.97,6234.528,6245.539,"Good morning, everybody I'm Brenda Rodriguez Lopez and thank you so much John for providing us that context and the amazing work over the years.",135,,
618,0.97,6245.539,6280.607,"For all our partners in the health equity for immigrants campaign, it's very important for our work to be guided and directed by those directly impacted by the inequities in Healthcare and which is why this campaign really focused a lot of efforts in 2020 in launching a Healthcare survey that will really help us assess the Healthcare barriers for adult immigrants in Washington especially within the context of the Covid-19 pandemic.",135,,
619,0.97,6280.607,6329.122,"We launched this campaign in 2020 a few months after Wisen had Pivoted its deportation defense Hotline to connect people to resources like food banks and bread Fndz and any mutual aid efforts because we were receiving an average of 10,000 calls a day from people across the state including Kung county in crisis who have just lost employment who had been exposed to the virus and didn't have enough space in their apartment to quarantine from people that had their loved ones in hospitals and they had no idea how they were going to be able to afford the medical bill.",135,,
620,0.97,6329.122,6332.125,"The medication, and still provide for basic necessities.",135,,
621,0.97,6332.125,6340.634,So this was very much a reality of our communities across the state.,135,,
622,0.97,6340.634,6354.281,"And for some, parents were laid off so that cut income and left them with no access to safety net to provide basic necessities and for others, our parents were deemed essential workers.",135,,
623,0.97,6354.281,6393.687,My parents are Undocumented immigrants so they were having access to income but the workplace was not enforcing Covid-19 safety guidelines so they were being exposed to this deadly virus and including their Livly hood every single day so we organize coalition health equity for immigrants campaign along with a report in September of 2020 in partnership with so many of you here.,135,,
624,0.97,6393.687,6418.612,"Nola, ACLU, Acrs, and we have much promise tho this survey and wanted to make sure we minimize the barrier of Accessing Online survey so we worked with 46 community organizations while they were already on the ground doing application assistance for the state wide relief Fund.",135,,
625,0.97,6418.612,6435.028,La Tina hosted listening sessions and we also were helping people complete the survey through the Wisen Hotline and we Wantd to be intentional to have both ethnic and geographical representation.,135,,
626,0.97,6435.028,6452.078,"So we worked together with immigrants coming in the organization, public health policy experts and received over 6,000 responses from adult immigrants living in the state.",135,,
627,0.97,6452.078,6464.858,"So folks like my parents felt comfortable completing it and it was available intended for languages and again, the goal was to assess the Healthcare access barriers for our communities and state.",135,,
628,0.97,6464.858,6474.768,And the report highlighted many of us already knew and what the chairman was mentioning in her introduction.,135,,
629,0.97,6474.768,6495.188,"87% of Respondants lacked Healthcare coverage due to immigration status and the high cost, they were two barriers we knew in the community and growing up very much the reason why my parents didn't take us to the doctor or didn't go to the doctor themselves.",135,,
630,0.97,6495.188,6512.272,And this report was very instrumental in designing the campaign structure that was driven by community needs and why we have been so fiercely organizing to Crow Yat a long term permanent solution.,135,,
631,0.97,6512.272,6529.356,"So the vision of the campaign is for all people living in Washington State to have access to Healthcare regardless of immigration status and specifically, we are organized and advocating for three major goals.",135,,
632,0.97,6529.356,6532.559,One is access to financial health for Healthcare coverage.,135,,
633,0.97,6532.559,6552.512,We don't just want to design programs that will continue to Replicate the barriers our community told us through the surveys and we have known over the years so we want to make sure those that cannot afford Healthcare coverage don't pay into this program.,135,,
634,0.97,6552.512,6571.398,And people with higher income still have financial support to access the exchange qualified health plans so we are very intentional of addressing the two main barriers that came out of the report at every point in the campaign.,135,,
635,0.97,6571.398,6578.438,"And for me, the person was political and I'm very invested in this work and committed to this campaign.",135,,
636,0.97,6578.438,6603.763,As my mother is one of the thousands of Undocumented immigrants living in our state without Healthcare coverage even as she's battling cancer and she has been working for this country for over 20 years with sometimes not even having enough food to feed herself.,135,,
637,0.97,6603.763,6616.343,"Go to doctor or afford treatments so in King County, Spl specifically, the third city where immigrants called the Wisen Hotline seeking help with medical bills or needing funds to pay Medications.",135,,
638,0.97,6616.343,6647.674,"They also call us asking for support in advocating the Healthcare system because they are afraid it will lead to being detained by immigration officers so again, this is very much in alignment with what the Healthcare report highlighted and the Covid-19 pandemic has shown how interconnected our health is to one another so meeting the basic needs of all Washingtonens regardless of immigration status is the correct approach to improve public health for all of us and our community.",135,,
639,0.97,6647.674,6650.043,So thank you so much for your time today.,135,,
640,0.97,6650.343,6654.614,.,135,,
641,0.97,6654.948,6658.151,Thank you for walking us through the presentation.,136,,
642,0.97,6658.151,6660.487,Now over to the rest of the crew here.,136,,
643,0.97,6660.787,6690.05,"So that's a Cue for me to start speaking, good morning everyone again I'm a primary care doctor and serve as chief medical officer and our goal is to provide quality Healthcare to everybody in the community Fortunately we are part of the community immigrant alliance.",137,,
644,0.97,6690.05,6694.788,Today I'm Bricking to you the story of a patient of ours.,137,,
645,0.97,6694.788,6705.832,So every day he is a Dishwasher for a restaurant in the International district and goes over to his small terrible apartment which he shares with his wife and two kids.,137,,
646,0.97,6705.832,6709.235,Health and money weigh heavily on them.,137,,
647,0.97,6709.235,6717.01,Especially now that he hears a new variant Omicron is on the rampage and his owner might have to close the restaurant again.,137,,
648,0.97,6717.01,6722.415,"Since the pandemic started, work has carried an unimaginable burden for him.",137,,
649,0.97,6722.415,6734.294,"Being the only source of income for his family, he must continue to work in the small confines of work that bear his vulnerable exposure to Covid-19.",137,,
650,0.97,6734.294,6740.266,It's not just the pandemic that scares him.,137,,
651,0.97,6740.266,6744.571,As an Undocumented immigrant it's uncertainty of his health as this pandemic unfolds.,137,,
652,0.97,6744.571,6751.377,"He often wonders if he needed emergency care, what would he do?",137,,
653,0.97,6751.377,6757.383,Due to his uninsured status he seeks Healthcare for a long time.,137,,
654,0.97,6757.383,6764.757,"The unfamiliar Healthcare system and all its complications and most importantly, the cost always scares him.",137,,
655,0.97,6764.757,6772.999,He's able to utilize the scale but still needs to pay for the care.,137,,

657,0.97,6786.012,6804.731,While this can be explained by the socioeconomic and geography differences it's also related to illegal status and subsequently affect the ability to update Healthcare coverage.,137,,
658,0.97,6804.731,6821.648,Several Undocumented immigrant patients in large parts because they are covered with the affordable care act Medicare and many programs across the nation and Janet pointed out to issues that cannot happen in our own state.,137,,

664,0.97,6884.444,6891.517,They were able to acknowledge his beliefs in an appropriate manner.,137,,
665,0.97,6891.517,6898.024,But some of this at larger institutions is still very nerve wracking for him.,137,,
666,0.97,6898.024,6911.771,He would appreciate Healthcare coverage which can cover the cost of such care and provide his appointment scheduling interpretation and maneuvering the maze of these institutions.,137,,
667,0.97,6911.771,6926.92,He understands the helpfulness of appropriate outreach from his safety net institution but acknowledged his concerns are on Accessing care in a safe environment of safety and trust.,137,,
668,0.97,6926.92,6935.194,The public charge rule has created confusion and distrust and isolated him and his friends from seeking Healthcare and social services.,137,,
669,0.97,6935.194,6943.636,He hopes the feeling of the safety and trust can be expended to any new policy that could come around.,137,,

694,0.97,7133.86,7134.093,Michael?,139,,
695,0.97,7134.093,7136.128,Hey there thank you again members of Council.,140,,
696,0.97,7136.128,7138.231,Thank you for having me.,140,,
697,0.97,7138.231,7153.513,I'm here specifically to talk about and reference what Dr. Depa Yurman mentioned as it related to the access in Healthcare coverage within the Asian and Pacific Islander community.,140,,
698,0.97,7153.513,7158.518,Brenda and Dr. model talked about the Latin community impacted.,140,,
699,0.97,7158.518,7168.227,"Here in the greater Seattle Metro poll Tan area we have 39,000 people who identify as patients.",140,,

701,0.97,7175.301,7188.548,In addition we have over 50% of the top ten identified populations in the communities that represent the Asian Pacific Islander.,140,,
702,0.97,7188.548,7191.45,So it's relevant and an impact to the communities.,140,,
703,0.97,7191.45,7205.565,The situation right now is that the Healthcare for health equity for moving coalition campaign is working really hard over the previous legislative session to advocate as it relates to Healthcare access and coverage.,140,,
704,0.97,7205.565,7224.35,We know that there's still a lot more work to do during the short legislative session at the state level and we're focusing on a very specific strategic budget strategy as we continue to on the campaign.,140,,
705,0.97,7224.35,7247.206,The governor stated in his budget he will move resources to administer any funds that the state wouldn't be distributing out for Healthcare coverage and then I think it's really critical as we Mo forward to think through at the state level in 2024 to ensure that there's seed funding to support this program.,140,,
706,0.97,7247.206,7287.647,So as it relates to specifically the city level I think that the state efforts are important but the city of Seattle has been a real important leader in terms of addressing the needs of the immigrant community and an important opportunity for Council to lead here as well on this important issue to jump start basically brought a conversation down that would impact the community so I'm looking to you in your leadership to strongly consider efforts at the city level to augmented support or to accelerate what's going on at the state level as it relates to Healthcare coverage for Undocumented community.,140,,
707,0.97,7287.647,7297.59,"Comment, thank you all so very much for the presentation and for all of the work that you do in your day job and for setting aside time for this work session here today.",141,,
708,0.97,7297.59,7310.002,"I want to ask how we can be helpful as you have heard, the deputy Mayor he recalled NOTE the importance of this issue for the mayors administration.",141,,
709,0.97,7310.002,7330.89,"That gives me excitement and I think as you saw from Janet's slide early in the presentation, we know that there's about a $53 million price tag for our County and I really appreciate the work that you're doing at the state level really to help governor including a down payment on this in his proposed budget as well.",141,,
710,0.97,7330.89,7336.729,We know this still needs to be worked through the state presentation.,141,,
711,0.97,7336.729,7340.7,So can you tell us more about how we can help?,141,,
712,0.97,7340.7,7346.505,And you have both the executive and legislative branch here for Seattle government on the line here today.,141,,
713,0.97,7346.505,7360.619,Is there a way we can plug in to the state level efforts and other things we should be doing at the city level in the meantime?,141,,
714,0.97,7360.619,7360.786,.,142,,
715,0.97,7360.786,7363.856,I can try at that one.,143,,
716,0.97,7363.856,7378.437,We have health equity for immigrants campaign and we of course would appreciate any support that this city can bring to that as well as communication with other local and county folks.,143,,
717,0.97,7378.738,7403.996,They come out in support of the campaign and it would be fantastic to have others and public folks policy makers and public officials to process this campaign and articulate how it would help at the local level.,143,,
718,0.97,7403.996,7422.214,"And Particuarly, I think with this experience of the county having tried and pursued research and pursued reporting and looking at options just not quite being able to get there yet.",143,,
719,0.97,7422.214,7426.685,Articulating the value of that would be really incredible.,143,,
720,0.97,7426.685,7432.525,And of course we don't know what's going to happen at the state level.,143,,
721,0.97,7432.525,7462.755,We don't know when and how much so it really would pay off for this administration to jump start efforts to think about how to create a local level solution like the one in San Francisco or Contra Costa county or Maryland.,143,,
722,0.97,7462.755,7473.766,So we are certainly willing and open to support any investigation and exploration of what could happen at the local level as well.,143,,
723,0.97,7473.766,7487.613,"But you know, immediately in the next couple of months as the short session continues, we would love to see any support that you can provide for the team.",143,,
724,0.97,7487.613,7506.432,"Well, if you send us the link to the campaign, we will be sure to share it on my social media with members who are in the viewing public and we'll take a look to see if there's something we can do from the city side as well and you noted that there's a legislative strategy tied to the budget originally.",144,,
725,0.97,7506.432,7517.309,I was thinking this was a piece of legislation already drafted or Prefiled but it's part of the budget strategy so the ask is really to include this in the file budget.,144,,
726,0.97,7517.309,7522.882,Is that what I'm hearing?,144,,
727,0.97,7522.882,7523.115,Yes.,145,,
728,0.97,7523.115,7525.384,Yes that's the current strategy.,145,,
729,0.97,7525.384,7526.185,There's no Prefiled legislation.,145,,
730,0.97,7526.185,7539.965,There was a bill last year that was kind of a starting point which is still because of the biannual system that bill is still present.,145,,
731,0.97,7539.965,7543.602,Help me with the number.,145,,
732,0.97,7543.602,7544.036,It might be 11981.,145,,
733,0.97,7544.036,7557.316,We'll know more in the next few weeks about how legislation enters the picture.,145,,
734,0.97,7557.316,7561.02,I see Brenda put in the link to the campaign so you can have that information in the chat.,145,,
735,0.97,7561.02,7563.989,It's also at the end of the Powerpoint.,145,,
736,0.97,7563.989,7569.094,"Great, if it's in the Powerpoint folks in the viewing public can have a chance to see it.",146,,
737,0.97,7569.094,7574.867,The chat doesn't really appear for folks in the public we'll put it on our social media.,146,,
738,0.97,7574.867,7578.771,Senior deputy Mayor anything else from you before we wrap up here?,146,,
739,0.97,7578.771,7583.943,"No, just thrilled to have you join us today.",147,,
