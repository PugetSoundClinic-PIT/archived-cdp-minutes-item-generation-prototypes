315,0.97,1864.062,1868.299,It's interesting to see I believe his name was Mr.,62,,

321,0.97,1893.892,1906.07,I just wanted to raise this because I think that the state of downtown really spoke to this committee meeting and to Stia influence.,62,,
322,0.97,1906.07,1918.049,"And so two points, one I know you spoke about the I know a place and I know I need to come into my Video with you to show you my places.",62,,
323,0.97,1918.049,1928.626,"But, two questions for you, how are you using these dollars to show the world that Seattle is in fact thriving?",62,,
324,0.97,1928.626,1942.04,"And, how are you Partnering with the regional homelessness authority, because for the regional homeless authority to be successful we all have to do a little bit.",62,,

326,0.97,1950.181,1953.618,Those are the two kind of Framings of questions.,62,,
327,0.97,1953.618,1960.725,How are you showing Seattle is thriving and how are you Partnering to help address the homelessness issues?,62,,
328,0.97,1960.725,1965.396,"Thank you, Councilmember.",63,,

331,0.97,1973.304,1984.816,I think all of us left that meeting knowing and feeling the optimism and excitement of the city and what is ahead of us as we come through recovery into the next number of years.,63,,
332,0.97,1984.816,1996.06,"Since 2011 Council members, as you know, the Stia has promoting travel to the city and region.",63,,
333,0.97,1996.06,2015.046,"We took a different approach seven or eight years ago as we looked at exploring deeper neighborhoods in the city, small business, business is owned by Bipoc owners, minority, women owned businesses, celebrating everything we have with a slant towards arts and culture, food certainly, and attractions and museums.",63,,
334,0.97,2015.046,2020.051,So we feel really good about the work we've been doing.,63,,
335,0.97,2020.051,2022.487,Certainly we know right now the need is more critical than ever.,63,,

337,0.97,2025.723,2027.558,And to do it in a much stronger way.,63,,
338,0.97,2027.558,2041.773,"As I have said a number of times, we are going to need to work very hard as a city to earn tourism recovery.",63,,
339,0.97,2041.773,2048.479,"I think especially if you look the last couple of years with negative publicity and things that are sometimes deserved, often not deserved, we are working very hard in all areas to do that.",63,,
340,0.97,2048.479,2053.351,We are proud of the work we have done and I know you have seen a lot of the work we have done.,63,,

342,0.97,2059.023,2070.401,We know that has been a missing link in our struggles with how we treat all of the elements around unsheltered people.,63,,
343,0.97,2070.401,2082.246,"I do think, and I am proud of the work that the lodging community has done, directly and indirectly, through taxes and tourism and lodging taxes that had been going for housing.",63,,
344,0.97,2082.246,2087.885,We know that is a critical element in the equation to get us further ahead in homelessness.,63,,
345,0.97,2087.885,2102.7,"I'm very proud from convention center money being spent to the King County tax in the city and lodging for a large amount, hundreds of millions of dollars to housing.",63,,
346,0.97,2102.7,2110.641,And certainly the short-term rental tax as you know well in the last couple of years has been directly appropriated to the city for use in different levels of housing.,63,,

351,0.97,2122.22,2140.104,"Just noting over the last 25 years, you played a very large role in a lot of the marketing for our city in helping to grow Seattle as a destination which then helps us grow as a city and as you say, indirectly everything is tied.",64,,
352,0.97,2140.104,2142.106,Congratulations and thank you for all of your work.,64,,

359,0.97,2183.748,2185.783,I will have to suspend the rules to do so.,66,,
360,0.97,2185.783,2200.031,"Just what we are talking, the short-term rental tax we're talking about tax on Airbnb's, it funds investment in affordable housing programs and community initiative equitable development projects as determined by the city of Seattle.",66,,
361,0.97,2200.031,2213.611,Pre-Covid in 2019 it generated $9.4 million . In 2020 it dropped to $3.8 million and in 2021 it was that $6.1 million.,66,,

366,0.97,2242.139,2251.482,Finally the Washington state convention center summit building project is $93 million in community investments including nearly $40 million for affordable housing.,66,,
367,0.97,2251.482,2287.351,"Then I will go on to note that the ability for us to promote Seattle as a destination for leisure tourism is important for downtown recovery but also for the whole city as we learned last time, the visit Seattle promotes all neighborhoods of the city and, in doing so helps those businesses all over the city stay in business, grow, server neighborhoods and generate taxes for the city's general fund.",66,,
368,0.97,2287.351,2297.495,"And then we go ahead and support, obviously, many services that are needed by many agencies.",66,,

393,0.97,2428.325,2448.979,And the funding here is so important because the estimated additional $3.5 million for marketing and promotion will fuel extra spending and specifically the hard-hit Industries through efforts coming up that I look for to participating in.,67,,
