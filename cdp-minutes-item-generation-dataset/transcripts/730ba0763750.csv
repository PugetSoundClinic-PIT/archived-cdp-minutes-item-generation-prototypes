54,0.97,311.244,317.817,My name is Mike Stewart and I'm the executive director of the Ballard alliance.,13,,
55,0.97,317.817,335.435,"First, thank you chair Pedersen and vice chair Strauss for hosting the meeting which includes a review of the draft resolution sound transit regarding the West Seattle Ballard link extension project.",13,,
56,0.97,335.435,340.306,The extension is really a Transformative project that will have a significant positive impact on the community throughout the region.,13,,

59,0.97,359.959,366.699,Ballard is United in his desire for a tunnel alignment with the station located on Northwest market street at 15th Avenue Northwest.,13,,
60,0.97,366.699,380.246,The stations in this location will only serve transit riders located in the central Ballard Corbett will help with preserving their time and address industrial needs pick the draft resolution before you today is spot on.,13,,
61,0.97,380.246,390.123,We fully support the resolution that station access be provided from the West side of 15th Avenue Northwest as well as from both sides of market street.,13,,
62,0.97,390.123,394.26,A station located at 15th is the only option that will ensure pedestrian safety.,13,,
63,0.97,394.26,408.841,A 14th Avenue station will not only put pedestrians at risk with crossing of the major freight corridor but would Miss the mark in serving the existing and ever-growing ever growing core in Ballard.,13,,
64,0.97,408.841,416.449,"Should the resolution include the recognition for (Indiscernible) on the other areas, we would endorse additional studies of alternative stations located west of 15th Avenue Northwest.",13,,

72,0.97,451.617,459.292,"After one day of care, the program said they did not have the capacity or the resources to care for him.",15,,
73,0.97,459.292,469.235,"The parents promise themselves if they could ever open a program, they would and they would do so with the intent of accepting, providing for and Nurturing every child.",15,,
74,0.97,469.235,476.976,"As we plan an extension to a capacity of 300 children, it is heartbreaking to know that everything we have built might be destroyed.",15,,
75,0.97,476.976,478.678,We have made our life's work to provide quality care.,15,,
76,0.97,478.678,486.185,"Without batting an eye, the city would encourage ripping hundreds of Healthcare spots.",15,,
77,0.97,486.185,494.627,The program was owned and operated by First-Generation Americans and women of color and the primary concern is providing uninterrupted high- quality care to children in the Ballard school corridor.,15,,
78,0.97,494.627,503.736,"The biggest frustration with these proceedings is the fact that nowhere in the draft EIS is our program mentioned, let alone the (Indiscernible) would Demolish assist.",15,,
79,0.97,503.736,515.348,"In conversations with sound transit, they will address the oversight they say in the final EIS now cities are using this mistaken information to determine preferences and that is how we end up in situations like this.",15,,
80,0.97,515.348,520.419,A city prepared to Demolish what would be as large as Childcare provider without knowing it even exists.,15,,
81,0.97,520.419,527.727,"The future of our families, employees and programs are held in the hands of people answering whether to destroy our LifeSpan our city is prepared to drive them to it.",15,,

91,0.97,569.502,576.842,(Indiscernible) organizations are very excited to welcome the link light rail to the Seattle center.,19,,
92,0.97,576.842,582.548,We know that a large percentage of our visitors and attendees will arrive that way making the station one of the busiest in the system.,19,,
93,0.97,582.548,604.971,We have spent the last 14 months learning about this complex project and we want to think Seattle center director and his staff and their staff for their collaborative approach and for Council members and staff to have and will be coming out to tour the locations at Seattle center.,19,,
94,0.97,604.971,615.247,We did not come easily to the conclusion that the Republican Street station location was untenable both we are appreciative of the city's conclusion to support the mix and match alternative.,19,,
95,0.97,615.247,627.76,There is so much we don't know about the option but we are going to take the same thoughtful approach to make sure that the city and sound transit are well aware of the concerns of the unique arts and cultural organizations along Mercer street.,19,,
96,0.97,627.76,634.767,We look forward to continuing to partner with all of you to make sure that the best possible decisions for this Massively complex project are realized.,19,,
97,0.97,634.767,635.201,Thank you so much.,19,,

104,0.97,666.465,672.104,I want to second Mike Stewart's comments on the location at the resolution.,21,,
105,0.97,672.104,694.293,"We think that it is an invaluable to have it under the ship Canal and also stationed not the 14th but the 15th and I will second the comments that if you are going to start the resolution or study other things, we prefer the station be located more West of 15th and downtown Seattle, out of the industrial area.",21,,
106,0.97,694.293,702.568,But also we are more appropriate for sound transit in the (Indiscernible) district.,21,,

113,0.97,734.467,742.408,Having Fifth Avenue as a selection is very bad for the whole region.,23,,
114,0.97,742.408,747.646,And this is a human cost issue.,23,,
115,0.97,747.646,755.654,"And if you folks go on Fifth Avenue, it will wipe out Chinatown and there will not be any Chinatown.",23,,
116,0.97,755.654,762.728,I really appreciate if you do the right human thing and choose fourth Avenue or another alternative.,23,,

124,0.97,794.093,805.571,"We believed then that the Kingdome would have the devastating impact on the Cid cultural and quality of life for residents, particularly low income and a Luly that live there.",25,,
125,0.97,805.571,808.107,Small businesses would suffer as well.,25,,
126,0.97,808.107,814.38,"Presently, we find ourselves in a similar struggle against sound transit, light rail expansion into or near the Cid.",25,,
127,0.97,814.38,819.752,We find the fifth Avenue route unacceptable.,25,,
128,0.97,819.752,830.062,"Please remember 134 years ago, the Chinese were forcibly removed from Seattle and than 80 years ago, the Japanese- Americans suffered the same fate and then 2022, we will not let history repeat itself in the Cid.",25,,

137,0.97,862.561,868.2,We are longtime champions of standing transit in the Puget sound and support the White rails.,27,,
138,0.97,868.2,877.376,The most important thing you can do is open the light rail on time and manage to agree on a recommended preferred alternative for what voters approved in 2016.,27,,
139,0.97,877.376,883.782,The resolution as drafted reflects many of the positions of the business immunity and arts and cultural along the alignment.,27,,
140,0.97,883.782,897.997,"The Seattle Metro Chamber (Indiscernible) as the project advances, we encourage you and sound transit to work Collaboratively with the public to refine, design and develop construction mitigation plans.",27,,
141,0.97,897.997,913.445,Constructing new infrastructure in an urbanized area will impact people that live and work along the businesses recovering from the transit second 19 pandemic and may not enter the impact described in the draft EIS to realize the benefits of light rail.,27,,
142,0.97,913.445,919.718,"This is noted in the resolution as well as downtown, public like Union, Seattle center and the rest of the alignment.",27,,
143,0.97,919.718,927.927,We ask that the city work with sound transit to identify different cap approaches to avoid or minimize impact and developed robust mitigation plans.,27,,
144,0.97,927.927,929.762,This will take more than a business as usual approach.,27,,
145,0.97,929.762,936.869,We also encourage the C█Ity to continue to work with the community including major employers to optimize the recommended preferred alternative.,27,,
146,0.97,936.869,943.342,That alternative Unfortunately represents (Indiscernible),27,,
147,0.97,943.342,944.176,Thank you very much.,28,,
148,0.97,944.176,949.748,"For all speakers, do E-mail your comments if you can to the Council at Seattle.Gov.",28,,
149,0.97,949.748,954.219,Next time we have Deb Barker followed by Paul Lowery.,28,,

155,0.97,980.512,987.319,I'm in favor of the South corridor over the to Amish waterway.,29,,
156,0.97,987.319,994.293,"Most apparently, I'm here to speak about, not favorably speak, but speak to bad design.",29,,
157,0.97,994.293,1006.138,Bad station design violates all the principles of training that many of the stationary areas until.,29,,
158,0.97,1006.138,1015.681,These are placed in a mode so the watch shed is around the note.,29,,
159,0.97,1015.681,1023.022,And disappointed by the proposed alignment of the Delridge segment to the Andover Delridge location.,29,,
160,0.97,1023.022,1037.803,That is a very poor location for any potential transit oriented development which is desperately needed within the corridor.,29,,
161,0.97,1037.803,1049.381,"And the city of Seattle bears a huge responsibility to ensure that there is equitable transit oriented development, putting a station at the intersection of Andover and Delridge is a horrible mistake.",29,,
162,0.97,1049.381,1053.419,Thank you very much.,30,,
163,0.97,1053.419,1065.964,"Please do E-mail your comments as well next we have Sergio Zamora followed by, last name Strout.",30,,

314,0.97,1985.55,2003.568,The last thing here I will say is the 41St Street option seems to be a good option to keep things low so it is not affecting the neighborhood and why can't that connect to the preferred tunnel in Genesee.,50,,

365,0.97,2226.324,2230.161,Spu mutely stopped using the existing sewer line and attempted an emergency repair but was unsuccessful.,63,,

377,0.97,2303.534,2323.187,"Administrative fee of 1510. in summary, the Spu requested action is for counsel to accept this ordinance for an easement that was already executed in early 2020. do you have any questions?",63,,

381,0.97,2334.365,2348.679,I do have a question about the timing of the easement as it relates to when the legislation came to us.,66,,
382,0.97,2348.679,2353.117,Is that Covid related delays?,66,,
383,0.97,2353.117,2357.722,Easement looks like it was executed in 2020.,66,,
384,0.97,2357.722,2362.293,Just curious about that.,66,,
385,0.97,2362.293,2368.699,"Also, and you may have addressed this and I might have missed it.",66,,
386,0.97,2368.699,2377.241,"If the existing sewer line was not being used in order to prevent (Indiscernible) from entering the waterway, is there a backup in the area not shown on the map?",66,,
387,0.97,2377.241,2388.619,"Jacques, are you about to answer those two questions?",67,,

393,0.97,2412.109,2412.51,Okay.,69,,
394,0.97,2412.51,2416.046,The second question.,69,,
395,0.97,2416.046,2427.525,Impact of not using existing line and whether or not that created any Backups.,70,,
396,0.97,2427.525,2433.397,I don't believe it did create any Backups.,71,,
397,0.97,2433.397,2439.537,Not that I recall.,71,,
398,0.97,2439.537,2441.372,'s Cody Nelson on the line?,71,,

404,0.97,2457.855,2466.564,And we installed the new pipe and then we Decommission into the existing pipe.,72,,
405,0.97,2466.564,2474.138,"Because the pipe was left in place, we needed to keep the old easement because the pipe does go through the waterway which is owned by Army Corps.",72,,

407,0.97,2474.505,2496.494,"Generally, when one period of time goes between the execution of an easement and the Council's actions, does that create any issues for the city or the property owners?",74,,
408,0.97,2496.494,2516.113,Or is it just a bureaucratic thing that isn't a thing we should be concerned about or look at creating structures or approaches to avoid that kind of a gap in the future?,74,,

679,0.97,4059.655,4068.697,And the limitation of these tactics are Departmentwide left.,138,,
680,0.97,4068.697,4075.07,"Tactics are organized into different categories from advocacy, policy program to behavior and cultural level changes such as process and practice.",138,,
681,0.97,4075.07,4078.941,On the slide or two examples of tactics from the implantation plan.,138,,

684,0.97,4093.856,4114.743,"Many of the tactics identified are about shifting the ways we do things that we already do and will necessarily require significant new resources while others will require us to identify new or Prioritized funding over time, whether we absorb cost, leverage existing budgets or other avenues.",138,,
685,0.97,4114.743,4121.717,I would like to emphasize to you that this plan is a dynamic document that will be adjusted monitored and updated regularly.,138,,
686,0.97,4121.717,4132.828,"With that, I will pass my word over to my colleague.",138,,
687,0.97,4132.828,4140.269,I will talk a little bit about RSGI at Sdot.,139,,
688,0.97,4140.269,4141.937,Michelle mentioned the Transformational equity leadership Cohort.,139,,
689,0.97,4141.937,4154.183,It has made us profoundly aware of how we have created barriers to services at Sdot.,139,,
690,0.97,4154.183,4165.261,"One profound take away from the Covid-19 pandemic is the power of Uplifting human solidarity and the inescapable need to humanize the work we do, which is a cornerstone of equity work and practice.",139,,
691,0.97,4165.261,4169.131,"So how did Sdot create space for people to share the reflections, anger and joy?",139,,
692,0.97,4169.131,4194.623,"Sdot has deepened its investment in the Rsg tools for we offer spaces to acknowledge and collectively process Realtime world events that impact black indigenous people of color in the workplace and elevating emergent equity issues and concerns to Sdot leadership, allowing us to be an authentic relationship with the community and each other.",139,,
693,0.97,4194.623,4197.993,And being intentional in the way we provide and make services accessible presently and moving forward.,139,,
694,0.97,4197.993,4202.932,Sdot has made a positive shift.,139,,
695,0.97,4202.932,4220.95,So the key determinants of the shift were based in Transformative and restorative justice processes including using the strategic questioning tool to deepen our understanding of Racialized harm which impacts both Bipoc people and those who identify as white.,139,,
696,0.97,4220.95,4222.818,And to undo systematic harm going forward.,139,,
697,0.97,4222.818,4244.974,"So strategic questioning offers and intentional will--intentional collaborative process that opens up options and solutions that might have seemed unavailable before pick the benefits we have experienced are far-reaching and have shifted our culture of work to be more meaningful and connected in the way we work with each other and ultimately, with community.",139,,
698,0.97,4244.974,4251.413,"We engaged in (Indiscernible) which is an intentionally and deliberately, making space kind of tool.",139,,
699,0.97,4251.413,4256.285,We take time to get to know ourselves through each other.,139,,
700,0.97,4256.285,4266.962,"And Sdot is shifting culture and making long strides toward becoming an equitable trustworthy agency, Aligning with its own values at every level using this process.",139,,
701,0.97,4266.962,4278.207,Some of the feedback we have received about this was that it was different to eliminate how important it is to know each other as a part of racial equity work.,139,,
702,0.97,4278.207,4280.376,And we use the circle process.,139,,
703,0.97,4280.376,4291.387,The circle process is a solid tool for relationship building and may be our most successful equity practice yet.,139,,
704,0.97,4291.387,4307.169,"Effective in preventing the transportation equity framework as well as everyday options to conducting meetings to support equity, effectiveness, excellence, circle process which is a restorative medication tool that allows thoughts, ideas, concerns and questions to be heard in a safe and collaborative environment.",139,,
705,0.97,4307.169,4315.477,And some feedback we heard about Sdot engaging in the circle processes which include improving our work.,139,,
706,0.97,4315.477,4316.111,Keep using it.,139,,

755,0.97,4664.559,4666.461,Just a few blocks away from Cedar park elementary.,142,,
756,0.97,4666.461,4670.432,The concept for it was community generated.,142,,
757,0.97,4670.432,4676.405,This speaks to the power of beyond the ground engagement and it came directly from a focus group.,142,,
758,0.97,4676.405,4684.379,So to the power of the partnership in the liaison program.,142,,
759,0.97,4684.379,4693.121,Sdot also worked closely and continues to work with a community based organization in the neighborhood and they have helped this outreach get planned and how to design the street.,142,,

762,0.97,4714.209,4719.347,So we did a Digital and phone survey.,142,,
763,0.97,4719.347,4724.586,"We have folks giving us feedback in English, Spanish and (Indiscernible) what we learned as people wanted to keep the streak the way it was.",142,,

790,0.97,4864.626,4865.126,Thank you.,146,,
791,0.97,4865.126,4881.109,I appreciate the opportunity to hear about the internal work you are doing . I think it is really important for creating a culture of safety and racial equity within the Department.,146,,
792,0.97,4881.109,4882.644,So Kudos to all of before that work.,146,,
793,0.97,4882.644,4888.884,I am particularly interested in the transportation equity framework that you talked about.,146,,
794,0.97,4888.884,4899.394,"And I will say that I feel like I have been talking a lot about safety issues, particularly in the South end.",146,,
795,0.97,4899.394,4905.1,"I have a few questions if I may, chair, around this particular topic.",146,,
796,0.97,4905.1,4905.5,Yes please.,147,,
797,0.97,4905.5,4907.502,Thank you.,148,,
798,0.97,4907.502,4920.782,"We are talking about a transportation system that supports black, indigenous people of color and communities that have historically been under invested.",148,,
799,0.97,4920.782,4938.366,"And I guess the first thing I'm interested in is, will this translate into things like sidewalks and traffic calming and alternative modes of transportation in areas that are lacking that kind of infrastructure?",148,,
800,0.97,4938.366,4962.824,"And I'm thinking particularly of districts two and District 5. and I guess what I'm really asking is, my assumption is that through this process, there will be a Reprioritizing of transportation safety projects in areas of the city that are currently lower in the Queue for getting these kinds of investments, relative to other parts of the city.",148,,
801,0.97,4962.824,4964.426,Thank you Councilmember Morales for that question.,149,,
802,0.97,4964.426,4970.632,I'm happy to answer.,149,,
803,0.97,4970.632,4989.217,I will say that our Tef includes safety as one of the values identified by the TW members and we have a series of tactics within that value that specifically call out sidewalk as a need for we do have several tactics that have been identified that touch that.,149,,
804,0.97,4989.217,4990.952,And that is spot on in terms of implementation.,149,,
805,0.97,4990.952,4998.493,This is where we will really start to assess and book at the different needs and the budget pieces too.,149,,
806,0.97,4998.493,5005.367,I do want to call out that we do have a public dashboard that houses all of the 200 Tef tactics.,149,,
807,0.97,5005.367,5016.578,"So you can go into that and see the specific tactics that have been called out under safety, related to sidewalk and pedestrian infrastructure investments.",149,,
808,0.97,5016.578,5020.515,I want to welcome Kristen to respond as well.,149,,
809,0.97,5020.515,5021.116,Thank you.,150,,
810,0.97,5021.116,5043.571,"I think the transportation equity framework is an excellent opportunity to look at the pedestrian master plan, which is what we have been using and which does incorporate safety data, equity data, as well as destination information to help us Prioritize projects that are a number of years old at this point.",150,,
811,0.97,5043.571,5054.749,I think Overlaying the two will help us to narrow in on and implement the equity framework using some of the information that we have.,150,,
812,0.97,5054.749,5056.051,Thank you.,151,,
813,0.97,5056.051,5102.997,"That really kind of leads into my second question, which is, I hear a lot from constituents that when they are requesting a stop sign or a crosswalk or some sort of traffic calming, that the responses either, there is no budget to do that, or you should use your voice, your choice and see if you can organize your community to get access to some resources, which given the District I represent, feels really inequitable to ask neighbors who are already working a few jobs and having some financial challenges, to now come together and organize the community and advocate and apply and all of that.",151,,
814,0.97,5102.997,5117.078,"And so, I'm wondering if the Department has considered an approach to road safety upgrades that are sort of baked into the processes, as opposed to requiring residents to take time to advocate for safety in their neighborhoods.",151,,
815,0.97,5117.078,5122.417,Is their some sort of rolling project to get the safety improvements that they need at some point?,151,,
816,0.97,5122.417,5130.158,There are couple.,152,,
817,0.97,5130.158,5151.746,"One is, as I mentioned, the pedestrian master plan helps us identify, we have a priority investment network for sidewalks and that also tells us where there is an overlay between identified safety concerns and high-volume destinations and equity focused geographic areas.",152,,
818,0.97,5151.746,5157.552,"Also, there are number of things you have done lately around safety.",152,,
819,0.97,5157.552,5164.526,"The leading pedestrian animals we have been installing on signals, that is a program where we are not waiting for people to request those but installing those Programmatically.",152,,
820,0.97,5164.526,5168.93,Same with the lowered speed limits.,152,,
821,0.97,5168.93,5172.967,We just did those across the city.,152,,
822,0.97,5172.967,5183.344,I think you are right that there is room to continue to build systems or we don't rely on the squeaky wheels or rely on people contacting us with the issues.,152,,
823,0.97,5183.344,5185.613,We want to continue doing that.,152,,
824,0.97,5185.613,5188.316,"Okay, thank you.",153,,
825,0.97,5188.316,5206.434,"My last question is, as we are talking about making the streets more accommodating and safer for people with disabilities, I'm hearing from folks who really have kind of an array of issues that they are dealing with.",153,,
826,0.97,5206.434,5230.391,"So for example, I'm hearing from people who have mobility needs who use a wheelchair, from people who have vision Impairments . and so the needs are different for how to accommodate them to be able to use our streets and sidewalks differently.",153,,
827,0.97,5230.391,5234.996,I'm wondering how that gets taken into consideration.,153,,
828,0.97,5234.996,5257.118,"For example, has the Department considered how to implement pedestrian or bicycle safety upgrades that can also accommodate disabled drivers while still putting traffic calming measures in place for drivers who don't have disabilities?",153,,
829,0.97,5257.118,5270.131,I don't know if that question is making sense but I'm thinking particularly of Lake Washington Boulevard where I'm hearing a lot from folks who want access so that they can get outside and they can walk or roll without worrying about cars.,153,,
830,0.97,5270.131,5288.149,I'm also hearing from disabled drivers for whom that is sort of those that is there access to the outdoors but they choose to drive because they don't want to roll.,153,,
831,0.97,5288.149,5311.639,I'm trying to understand that there is a way to accommodate the array of needs and still provide the access and the ability to increase the ways to get around for people who are not in a car.,153,,
832,0.97,5311.639,5313.541,"I think, many times yes.",154,,
833,0.97,5313.541,5319.213,"Sometimes, no which is probably not a very satisfactory answer.",154,,
834,0.97,5319.213,5362.29,"What I want to highlight from what you are saying and what Dan talked about in terms of community engagement, we can't do anything until we hear what people need and what they want and how they want to use their streets and access things in the neighborhood and travel through their community and that is the foundation of where we need to be listening to what people need to do and what their lived experience tells them is a good solution and we need to bring our expertise to that to combine the understanding of their needs with our tools available to transform the Streetscape.",154,,
835,0.97,5362.29,5371.766,I guess I'm thinking about Jfk drive in San Francisco and Golden gate park where you can drive on the street but only if you are disabled.,155,,
836,0.97,5371.766,5385.847,You have to have the disabled Placard in order to use the road or otherwise it is for people using a different mode of transportation . Thank you.,155,,
837,0.97,5385.847,5388.082,I appreciate all your time.,155,,
838,0.97,5388.082,5389.317,This is big work.,155,,
839,0.97,5389.317,5391.386,Another shift you are trying to make is a big shift.,155,,
840,0.97,5391.386,5407.368,I appreciate hearing about all the steps you are taking in all the work going into thinking differently about how you make transportation policy decisions so that it is not equitable.,155,,
841,0.97,5407.368,5407.902,Are really appreciated.,155,,
842,0.97,5407.902,5408.202,Thank you.,155,,
843,0.97,5408.202,5413.141,Thank you Councilmember Morales.,156,,
844,0.97,5413.141,5414.175,I want to echo that.,156,,
845,0.97,5414.175,5442.904,I had a similar situation with nearly 1000 low income Bipoc residents in terms of trying to get Improveents and a crosswalk . The research and data put in there for decision-making but it was not clear that the low income and equity data was baked and yet.,156,,
846,0.97,5442.904,5457.285,I'm happy about what is in district 2 to accompany you on a walking tour of some of the areas you are the most concerned about.,156,,
847,0.97,5457.285,5457.785,Councilmember Strauss.,156,,
848,0.97,5457.785,5461.856,"Thank you, chair.",157,,
849,0.97,5461.856,5471.999,"I just wanted to agree with everything Councilmember Morales said and thank all the Presenters for taking the time, not just a present but the immense amount of time to develop all these practices and policies.",157,,
850,0.97,5471.999,5473.034,This is a lot of work.,157,,
851,0.97,5473.034,5480.908,Thank you for using her time and energy to do this.,157,,
852,0.97,5480.908,5483.811,I will Piggyback on what Councilmember Morales said.,157,,
853,0.97,5483.811,5489.784,"During office hours which I hold every week, the number one request I get, it is usually about homelessness to be honest.",157,,
854,0.97,5489.784,5498.86,"The second one is for pedestrian safety, whether it is traffic--I have had this conversation so many times.",157,,
855,0.97,5498.86,5504.298,Director Simpson knows my Nuanced opinions about traffic signals and four way stops.,157,,
856,0.97,5504.298,5515.443,And all these improvements we need to make sure our streets to make it easier to walk or run or do everything.,157,,
857,0.97,5515.443,5521.682,"Because I still drive in 1972 Ford pick up from time to time and that thing gets from zero, to 60 in about 10 minutes.",157,,
858,0.97,5521.682,5528.122,"It is very different from the cars we drive today that go from zero, to 60 in two seconds.",157,,
859,0.97,5528.122,5537.765,That ability to maneuver around turns at higher rates of speed is why people are asking for more lighted Crosswalks.,157,,
860,0.97,5537.765,5546.541,More stop signs.,157,,
861,0.97,5546.541,5547.808,More speed bumps.,157,,
862,0.97,5547.808,5549.377,More of all of these things.,157,,
863,0.97,5549.377,5561.389,"Would I do know is Councilmember Morales and districts . different in my district, have a lot of people who have the time to come to office hours and make these requests of me and director Simpson has seen my long list.",157,,
864,0.97,5561.389,5567.495,I think there are at least 20 or 30 places in my district that have made these requests.,157,,
865,0.97,5567.495,5572.5,The planet will end with is that just relying on your voice and your choice is not enough.,157,,
866,0.97,5572.5,5577.772,We all need a different outlet.,157,,
867,0.97,5577.772,5583.444,"On so I wanted to Piggyback off of the great words of Councilmember Morales and above all else, thank you for your work.",157,,
868,0.97,5583.444,5590.785,Thank you Councilmember.,158,,
869,0.97,5590.785,5596.891,"Colleagues, any other questions or comments for our colleagues at Sdot?",158,,
870,0.97,5596.891,5597.525,"Councilmember Herbold, please.",158,,
871,0.97,5597.525,5608.002,I just want to thank folks at Sdot for initiating the racial equity Toolkit reviews for the Reconnecting with Seattle project.,159,,
872,0.97,5608.002,5616.744,They have definitely served the impacted areas very well.,159,,
873,0.97,5616.744,5630.257,Impacted areas in Detour routes that are primarily Bipoc communities and I appreciate the focus and attention and the resources.,159,,
874,0.97,5630.257,5630.558,Thank you.,159,,
875,0.97,5630.558,5631.325,Thank you Councilmember.,160,,
876,0.97,5631.325,5643.137,"Colleagues, any final comments or questions before we say goodbye to the steam at Sdot?",160,,
877,0.97,5643.137,5644.472,Thank you director Simpson.,160,,
878,0.97,5644.472,5648.009,Any final comments before we move on to the sound transit item?,160,,
879,0.97,5648.009,5652.947,Thank you for having us and we look forward to also hearing about the sound transit item.,161,,
880,0.97,5652.947,5653.447,Excellent.,162,,

884,0.97,5668.362,5668.863,I imagine.,162,,
885,0.97,5668.863,5671.232,Will the clerk please read the title of the next agenda item into the record.,162,,
886,0.97,5671.232,5679.04,"Agenda item four, resolution 32055.",163,,
887,0.97,5679.04,5694.622,"A resolution relating to sound transit, providing regulations to the sound transit board as to the selection of the preferred alternative for the West Seattle and Ballard link extensions project to be studied in the final environmental impact statement for breathing and discussion.",163,,
888,0.97,5694.622,5695.289,Thank you.,164,,
889,0.97,5695.289,5712.073,"Colleagues, as you know, and Aspirational goal of this joint resolution with the executive is to articulate and unified recommendations for the West Seattle Ballard link extension routes and locations of the stations.",164,,
890,0.97,5712.073,5723.484,I want to thank all the Stakeholders who have been providing ongoing input thus far including people who signed up for public comment today and several people have sent E- mails as well.,164,,
891,0.97,5723.484,5731.225,Today will be the first of two discussions that we will have for this resolution from Mayor Bruce Harrell.,164,,
892,0.97,5731.225,5743.003,The public will be invited back for a sing discussion to provide additional public comment and all Council members will again be invited to another committee meeting so we can keep talking about this resolution.,164,,
893,0.97,5743.003,5746.14,Maybe there will be some additional thoughts between now and then as well.,164,,
894,0.97,5746.14,5757.351,So I want to welcome--we have a dream team here.,164,,
895,0.97,5757.351,5780.407,We have Marshall foster and Sara (Indiscernible) Marshall fosters the city's designated representative from the executive and Sara (Indiscernible) from Sdot and we have Calvin chow who is a tradition expert on the city council central staff . and we want to remind folks here that we do have the hybrid meeting going on.,164,,

897,0.97,5784.311,5790.351,"We are, in addition to the regular members of the transportation Committee, we invited everybody.",164,,
898,0.97,5790.351,5792.82,We have had other Council members attend previous meetings.,164,,

903,0.97,5815.743,5817.778,No Councilmember.,166,,
904,0.97,5817.778,5821.749,It is a long presentation and I'm happy to work with any Councilmembers following this meeting as well.,166,,
905,0.97,5821.749,5827.822,Maybe let's just jump to the presentation and go from there.,166,,
906,0.97,5827.822,5828.556,Thank you.,167,,
907,0.97,5828.556,5838.032,"Councilmembers, as you have comments after the meeting, please go ahead and connect with Calvin chow.",167,,
908,0.97,5838.032,5840.134,"Welcome, Marshall and Sara.",167,,
909,0.97,5840.134,5841.135,Thank you tour Peterson.,168,,
910,0.97,5841.135,5845.573,"Councilmembers, it is great to be with you.",168,,
911,0.97,5845.573,5859.353,I will start with a couple of quick opening comments and I will turn it over to Sara who has a thorough presentation of everything that went into the recommendation in front of you.,168,,
912,0.97,5859.353,5872.733,"First, I want to emphasize that this resolution is intended to provide the city an opportunity to articulate the provision for Masiello extensions.",168,,
913,0.97,5872.733,5879.473,It is meant to be a tool to inform sound transit decisions on which alternatives will advance to the final environmental impact statement.,168,,
914,0.97,5879.473,5886.28,"As part of that, it is important to emphasize that these are not final decisions.",168,,
915,0.97,5886.28,5905.933,"When the sound transit board has decided which alternatives to advance, there is a full additional year of in-depth environmental analysis, assessment of impact, development of mitigation plans for the entire amount of alternatives in the document.",168,,
916,0.97,5905.933,5906.533,I want to emphasize that.,168,,
917,0.97,5906.533,5909.47,Why are we bringing forward the resolution?,168,,
918,0.97,5909.47,5926.954,"A critical piece of this is to provide clarity and transparency, transparency to the community as well as partners around St3 in terms of what the city goals and vision are and how that translates into specific choices around the alternatives.",168,,
919,0.97,5926.954,5939.667,"We are at a point with many years of work behind us where we have to start making some of the hard decisions about which specific options we think are preferred, recognizing that there are real Trade-Offs.",168,,
920,0.97,5939.667,5940.1,Significant ones.,168,,
921,0.97,5940.1,5944.305,I think you are hearing about some of those in the public comment today.,168,,
922,0.97,5944.305,5957.484,"We are very aware of those and we are committed--the key thing about these decisions is that it allows us to follow through on the intensive work with sound transit to mitigate those impacts, as we advance the work.",168,,
923,0.97,5957.484,5983.944,"The last point I will make is how important it is both for the community to understand where we are and as partners to sound transit, to get to some early decisions that are durable and allow us to move forward with some clarity as to how we would like to see the system built and to ensure we can streamline the delivery and permitting process and ultimately help to control costs for sound transit.",168,,
924,0.97,5983.944,5991.719,"That is a critical priority for everyone involved in the St3 program, including the city.",168,,
925,0.97,5991.719,5997.391,So I will turn it over to Sara who will walk you through the presentation.,168,,
926,0.97,5997.391,5997.958,Thank you.,169,,
927,0.97,5997.958,5999.526,I will ask bill to pull it out.,169,,
928,0.97,5999.526,6000.361,Thank you so much.,169,,
929,0.97,6000.361,6001.595,Thank you for having us here today.,169,,
930,0.97,6001.595,6007.634,We do have a very meaty presentation to get to.,169,,
931,0.97,6007.634,6014.908,We will do our best to move briskly through it Pausing periodically for discussion.,169,,
932,0.97,6014.908,6015.776,Heading to the next slide please.,169,,
933,0.97,6015.776,6035.929,"As Marshall laid out, the Council resolution is really meant to advance one vision for the West Seattle Ballard link extension project to really articulate at this juncture in the process, the city's vision for where the system should be built.",170,,
934,0.97,6035.929,6040.634,So today's presentation is broken out into a little bit of background on the presentation.,170,,
935,0.97,6040.634,6044.805,Or on the system rather.,170,,
936,0.97,6044.805,6047.574,And the work that has been done over the last several years.,170,,
937,0.97,6047.574,6053.48,The meet will be--the meat will be laid out in the Council resolution.,170,,
938,0.97,6053.48,6063.557,"For each of the four segments laid out, there will be an overview of the rationale behind the positions in the feedback in the community as well as some of the next steps the city would like to see take place.",170,,
939,0.97,6063.557,6067.928,And then a pause for discussion.,170,,
940,0.97,6067.928,6074.535,So we don't have to wait until the end to come back to questions about the earlier segments.,170,,
941,0.97,6074.535,6084.678,Then we will wrap up with next steps including discussion of the refinements to the Deis alternatives that have been discussed and next steps for the board action and the final EIS.,170,,
942,0.97,6084.678,6086.313,Next slide please.,170,,
943,0.97,6086.313,6091.418,Thank you.,170,,
944,0.97,6091.418,6092.252,First background.,170,,
945,0.97,6092.252,6092.553,Next line.,170,,
946,0.97,6092.553,6113.807,The overview of the project I think everyone on the Council and in the city that has been engaged with the project appreciates that the West Seattle and Ballard link extension project is one of the largest if not the largest infrastructure project in the city history and $12 billion.,171,,
947,0.97,6113.807,6118.879,It has the potential for tremendous transformation through the neighborhoods giving improved access and mobility to communities throughout the city and to the entire region.,171,,
948,0.97,6118.879,6133.393,"At the same time, it presents a very significant construction and related impact to existing communities as well as permanent changes to how those communities function with the new stations.",171,,
949,0.97,6133.393,6144.137,"The project includes over 12 miles of light rail track, 13 expanded stations, a new second light rail only transit tunnel downtown and two water crossings.",171,,
950,0.97,6144.137,6146.206,An important NOTE is this is not West Seattle to Ballard.,171,,
951,0.97,6146.206,6153.814,This is two separate projects and two separate extensions of the regional system.,171,,
952,0.97,6153.814,6163.891,The West Seattle link extension is an extension of the line three that will eventually extend from the Alaska junction West Seattle to the existing downtown tunnel and the up to Everett.,171,,
953,0.97,6163.891,6184.845,"Meanwhile, the Ballard link extension will go from the extension of line one and the regional system and it will go from Ballard station down to a new transit tunnel through downtown and then continue on to the Rainier Valley existing system all the way down to Tacoma.",171,,
954,0.97,6184.845,6185.546,Next slide.,171,,
955,0.97,6185.546,6189.783,Where we are in the broader process.,172,,
956,0.97,6189.783,6197.357,"As Marshall mentioned, there has been years of work that has gotten us to this point and many years ahead of us still.",172,,
957,0.97,6197.357,6224.151,The system will be delivered and we are at the tail end of the planning phase which is marked most notably by the environmental review process and we are just at the end of the draft environmental review that ended earlier this year and a sound transit board will be modifying the preferred alternative for studying the final EIS that will take place over the next year.,172,,
958,0.97,6224.151,6229.856,We expect the final EIS in 2023 and the board will select the project to be built and there will be a Federal record of decision in 2023.,172,,
959,0.97,6229.856,6247.441,This will all be followed by city council action as well to adopt the project and that action is necessary in order for the city to be able to permit the project for the city.,172,,
960,0.97,6247.441,6249.576,Next slide.,172,,
961,0.97,6249.576,6256.149,"The next several slides go through at a high level, the key input that went into the city recommendation.",172,,
962,0.97,6256.149,6275.002,"One enormous input from earlier this year with the Deis review, we had over 100 subject matter experts from across 15 departments in the city that reviewed and commented on the 8000 plus pages of the draft environmental document.",172,,
963,0.97,6275.002,6285.512,"In April, we transmitted to sound transit over 1500 technical comments on the Deis as well as cover letter of the key findings and recommendations.",172,,
964,0.97,6285.512,6286.413,Next slide.,172,,
965,0.97,6286.413,6294.154,"During that time, sound transit has done a tremendous amount of engagement throughout the system and throughout the city.",172,,
966,0.97,6294.154,6318.145,They have provided briefings including to city council in both February and April that really presented information about the alternatives in the draft EIS so from the draft presentation February that showed the South inner Bay and some comparison across key drivers or key Differentiators.,172,,
967,0.97,6318.145,6324.051,They also convened community advisory groups as well as briefings throughout the system.,172,,
968,0.97,6324.051,6324.685,Next slide.,172,,
969,0.97,6324.685,6350.41,"The city partnered with sound transit throughout the engagement effort as well as participated in city let engagement and community led engagement that included briefings, workshops, One-On- one meetings and then partnerships with sound transit and the Department of neighborhoods community liaison Cohort on the ground working with businesses and communities, particularly in the racial equity Toolkit identified communities of Chinatown International district and Delridge.",172,,
970,0.97,6350.41,6358.185,The city aims through all of this engagement to help inform decisions that are centered with racial equity and Cocreated.,172,,
971,0.97,6358.185,6364.791,Additional background is still what is feeding into the city recommendation.,173,,
972,0.97,6364.791,6379.439,"The city stood up for teams corresponding to the segments that we will walk through today and also correspond to how sound transit organized the community process and the segments of West Seattle and to Amish, downtown and then Ballard.",173,,
973,0.97,6379.439,6397.657,The city stood up teams to evaluate the alternatives in each segment to identify key Differentiators that helped understand the Trade-Offs across the alternatives and develop recommendations based on the areas of consensus or discussed areas of disagreement.,173,,
974,0.97,6397.657,6403.53,"And then Finally, highlight places in which a recommendation cannot be reached.",173,,
975,0.97,6403.53,6410.704,The Sigma teams include representation from nine city departments who all have a key role implicated in the delivery of this project.,173,,
976,0.97,6410.704,6411.037,Next slide.,173,,
977,0.97,6411.037,6436.596,"From all the work, the community engagement and the review, the city team Úidentified five key values Tha furthered values the city holds in all the long term planning documents and also served as ways to understand and differentiate the opportunities and the drawbacks associated with these different alternatives.",173,,
978,0.97,6436.596,6446.339,"To outline them quickly, racial equity, this is really an informed multiyear interagency racial equity Toolkit that we are doing with sound transit.",173,,
979,0.97,6446.339,6452.379,This is one of the first racial equity Toolkit is being done in partnership with another agency and it is being done over the entirety of the project.,173,,
980,0.97,6452.379,6468.895,"So starting back with alternatives development in 2017 and for every phase of work, there is a new publication of a racial equity Toolkit in a draft form with comments and then a final and we have continued that partnership throughout.",173,,
981,0.97,6468.895,6470.564,A second core value is safety and user experience.,173,,
982,0.97,6470.564,6491.051,Really looking to put the stations where they make sense from the user experience and trying to move forward with our vision zero goals as a city and ensure that the stations are located and designed in a way that ensure safe access and circulation that minimize pedestrian risk.,173,,
983,0.97,6491.051,6514.774,The third core value is a rather large bucket of community that is looking to further community priorities and minimize harm . This is done through minimizing business displacement and minimizing impacts to existing neighborhood assets and maximizing opportunities to further equitable TOD or other community identified priorities.,174,,
984,0.97,6514.774,6531.157,"The fourth core value, environmental protection, looking to minimize impact to the environmental areas and the financial stewardship, looking to be responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars by seeking the highest benefit per dollars spent in helping to keep the project on time and under budget.",174,,
985,0.97,6531.157,6536.396,The interplay of these values together will highlight through each segment.,174,,
986,0.97,6536.396,6544.437,You will see that there are some alternatives that will further two or three of the values and other alternatives Úthat might further the others.,174,,
987,0.97,6544.437,6554.848,This is all a process of Trade- off and how can we best maximize the benefit and the access to the system while minimizing impact and harm.,174,,
988,0.97,6554.848,6555.448,Next slide.,174,,
989,0.97,6555.448,6563.323,So we just want to acknowledge of front that this project is Impactful.,175,,
990,0.97,6563.323,6574.935,This project is 12 miles of new light rail track being built through a city that has already built out through existing neighborhoods.,175,,
991,0.97,6574.935,6587.881,"Their impacts identified through the Deis and have been discussed throughout land use, transpiration, noise and aesthetics in their property applications and thousands of potential parcels that could be impacted or be acquired because of this project.",175,,
992,0.97,6587.881,6592.519,Complete acquisitions will result in displacement of residences and businesses.,175,,
993,0.97,6592.519,6601.261,The city has a key role in advocating for alternatives that minimize these impacts.,175,,
994,0.97,6601.261,6612.772,The property Impactsand there are specific rules that the sound transit has to comply with to mitigate the impacts and to provide just compensation and to provide replacement housing and business Reestablishment programs.,175,,
995,0.97,6612.772,6624.184,"And sound transit has begun the outreach to impacted properties, residents and business owners.",175,,
996,0.97,6624.184,6628.188,The city will continue to work with sound transit to ensure the appropriate litigation is applied.,175,,
997,0.97,6628.188,6670.53,"One caveat before we go into each segment is that a case can be made based exclusively on impact against any of the alternatives being proposed right now and the presentation today and the recommendation from the city is really trying to find the balance and how can we maximize the benefit and maximize access while minimizing impact and acknowledge that the impact will be there and we need to work in partnership with communities, sound transit and other partners to minimize the we will go into the recommendation that is outlined in the Council ordinance.",175,,
998,0.97,6670.53,6676.77,We will walk through each segment starting with West Seattle and the due warmish area.,175,,
999,0.97,6676.77,6682.909,"For each segment, we will talk about the recommendations itself, the rationale based on those core values.",175,,
1000,0.97,6682.909,6685.845,We will have a little bit on what we heard from the engagement process so far.,175,,
1001,0.97,6685.845,6693.586,And a slide on additions needed in the segments.,175,,
1002,0.97,6693.586,6699.993,And then we will pause at the each--at the end of these for an opportunity of discussion.,175,,
1003,0.97,6699.993,6708.935,"While I'm the one going through the slides quickly, I will also be Pausing occasionally and will encourage Marshall to intervene at any point to add additional context.",175,,
1004,0.97,6708.935,6710.87,Let's start with the West Seattle segment.,175,,
1005,0.97,6710.87,6721.347,"This includes in the Deis alternatives and the West Seattle junction, the Delridge and the Duwamish.",175,,
1006,0.97,6721.347,6724.584,"Starting with the West Seattle junction segment, this includes the Alaska junction station and the Avalon station.",176,,
1007,0.97,6724.584,6737.864,Recommendation from the city is for Wsj5 which is the medium tunnel for the station at 41St Street Southwest with a retained station.,176,,
1008,0.97,6737.864,6742.902,Go ahead to the next slide.,176,,
1009,0.97,6742.902,6748.308,The rationale for this is from a safety and user experience standpoint to avoid the obstructions during operation.,177,,
1010,0.97,6748.308,6756.015,So this image presents a rendering of what we are trying to avoid.,177,,
1011,0.97,6756.015,6758.351,This is an image of WSJ one which is one of the elevated alternatives.,177,,
1012,0.97,6758.351,6769.829,Obstructions of an impact safety for all users.,177,,
1013,0.97,6769.829,6781.007,"In addition from a rationale from a community standpoint, avoiding numerous impacts with an elevated Guideway through existing residential neighborhood, including noise, aesthetics and again, the safety and considerations.",177,,
1014,0.97,6781.007,6791.551,"From a financial stewardship standpoint, the medium tunnel alternative offers the benefits of the tunnel alignment at a comparable cost of the other Deis elevated alternatives.",177,,
1015,0.97,6791.551,6792.085,Next slide.,177,,
1016,0.97,6792.085,6794.12,This is a rendering of what we are trying to avoid.,177,,
1017,0.97,6794.12,6803.53,This is a picture of--it would show an elevated structure and the impact associated with it.,177,,
1018,0.97,6803.53,6807.534,What we have heard from community's strong support for the tunnel.,177,,
1019,0.97,6807.534,6827.353,We heard about concerns for impacts of the elevated Guideway including noise for construction and development constraints due to column safety on the sideline obstructions as well as concerns about construction impact and operation.,177,,
1020,0.97,6827.353,6830.423,Next slide.,177,,
1021,0.97,6830.423,6831.257,Moving to the Delridge segment.,177,,
1022,0.97,6831.257,6842.836,We will take a little extra time with this segment because it is one of our Ret priority communities and there has been a tremendous amount of community deliberation about the alternatives.,177,,
1023,0.97,6842.836,6849.842,"The recommendation is for alternative Dell six, the elevated height Delridge station at Andover.",177,,
1024,0.97,6849.842,6861.187,"One thing to note is that they were really three groupings of stations, station alternatives and Delridge.",177,,
1025,0.97,6861.187,6863.223,There is the Andover that is the green thought you see.,177,,
1026,0.97,6863.223,6871.831,"The Delridge way alternatives at three and four and the Dakota Street alternatives, Dell one and Dell two.",177,,
1027,0.97,6871.831,6885.845,"And of note, for all of these stations, while they are couple blocks apart, for all the stations, the vast majority of passengers will access the station from the South by bus.",177,,
1028,0.97,6885.845,6894.354,"In particular at the Ret priority communities that live further South, a half mile south of the station, will access the station by bus.",177,,
1029,0.97,6894.354,6915.875,"A critical importance is thinking about not so much for the station is located in the North Delridge area but really, how the integration bus real works we are offering that seamless and safe experience for the users of the system.",177,,
1030,0.97,6915.875,6916.309,Next slide please.,177,,
1031,0.97,6916.309,6918.211,This image provides an aerial view of the Delridge valley.,178,,
1032,0.97,6918.211,6928.755,"To the right, the system comes in from the Duwamish water crossing and exits to the left toward tunnels and elevated to the West Seattle junction.",178,,
1033,0.97,6928.755,6935.028,You can see Delridge options 1A and 1B and 2A at Dakota street.,178,,
1034,0.97,6935.028,6949.709,You see Delridge three and four on the Delridge way alternatives and on the Furthest North you see five and six which are the Andover options.,178,,
1035,0.97,6949.709,6953.913,And then six which would connect to the medium tunnel which is a wreck mission to the city at this point.,178,,
1036,0.97,6953.913,6965.958,"Of NOTE is that, there are tremendous differences in some of the alternatives and different opportunities that present themselves for each.",178,,
1037,0.97,6965.958,6983.042,The two key priorities coming out of the racial equity tool work we have done in the community are to provide for the excellent bus real immigration as noted because most of the committee members coming from further South will access the station by bus.,178,,
1038,0.97,6983.042,6984.577,Also to minimize displacement and create opportunities.,178,,
1039,0.97,6984.577,7007.967,"One thing to note is that the Andover option, the Del6 option has the lowest displacement to the options and has comparable business displacement to some of the other options and significantly less than some of the alternatives on the table.",178,,
1040,0.97,7007.967,7009.469,And Andover expects about 200 residential Displacements.,178,,
1041,0.97,7009.469,7030.189,"The other alternatives are 320- 600 residential units that would be displaced and businesses, there would be 35 displaced with Andover and the other options range from 40, to 60.",178,,
1042,0.97,7030.189,7033.993,I do want to announce that Councilmember Lewis has joined us.,179,,
1043,0.97,7033.993,7034.394,Please continue.,179,,
1044,0.97,7034.394,7047.24,The rationale for this recommendation--I want to pause and take note that a lot of time and effort has been put into this particular segment because of these alternatives being impacted.,180,,
1045,0.97,7047.24,7054.781,In all the alternatives have opportunities associated with them.,180,,
1046,0.97,7054.781,7064.39,One key driver is looking from the community standpoint to avoid the effects of the tall Guideway including Displacements and visual impact over the residential community.,180,,
1047,0.97,7064.39,7121.614,"If I could ask you to go back to the previous slide quickly, notice that the Andover options then skirt along the (Indiscernible) property before moving on to the West Seattle junction avoid the elevated structure over the existing residential community whereas the perverted alternative in the Deis in pink is the Dakota Street alternative and would displaced 2-3 square blocks and would create this very high elevated highway over that . going to the next slide, this picture shows a rendering of what the Delridge way alternatives could look like, showing the image of an elevated Guideway through a residential neighborhood creating shadows and pipeline instructions for the place where folks would be Exiting the buses and getting on to the system.",180,,
1048,0.97,7121.614,7124.55,This is what we are looking to avoid with the Delridge six option.,180,,
1049,0.97,7124.55,7141.934,"From the financial stewardship as well, the Dell six alternative links to the tunnel which provides for roughly $500 million savings to the system.",180,,
1050,0.97,7141.934,7145.371,"What we heard from community, minimizing displacement while maximizing opportunity for community driven equitable TOD.",180,,
1051,0.97,7145.371,7163.823,"With that, we will be looking for opportunities if the Andover station moves forward, to create a meaningful Node there and provide for some of that opportunity for affordable housing and other neighborhood amenities that have been identified in the North Delridge action plan.",180,,
1052,0.97,7163.823,7171.43,We have heard the need for additional engagement with the Ret identified communities further South in the corridor and then again to Prioritize the seamless bus real immigration.,180,,
1053,0.97,7171.43,7181.607,Making sure folks can exit the bus and get on to the light rail system.,180,,
1054,0.97,7181.607,7188.214,We do identify some additional work that needs to happen between the Deis and the Feis.,181,,
1055,0.97,7188.214,7188.681,Ensuring safe it is.,181,,
1056,0.97,7188.681,7191.05,Access and seamless bus real immigration.,182,,
1057,0.97,7191.05,7196.889,This has challenges at the Andover site.,182,,
1058,0.97,7196.889,7201.527,We are actively working with sound transit and sound transit was already put on the table.,182,,
1059,0.97,7201.527,7221.681,Some refinements to the Andover station provided for safer pedestrian access from South of Andover and we are Interesed in exploring strategies to minimize the pedestrian conflict and recognizing their is a lot of traffic going to the area right now and we want to make sure that the long-term built scenario of that NOTE would be safe and Prioritizing that safe pedestrian access.,182,,
1060,0.97,7221.681,7242.368,"We will be looking again to minimize displacement while maximizing opportunity for the equitable TOD and in all scenarios, looking for strategies consistent with city code to Prioritize the protection of long-term restoration.",182,,
1061,0.97,7242.368,7242.668,Next line.,182,,
1062,0.97,7242.668,7254.08,The final segment in the Duwamish West Seattle area is the Duwamish water.,183,,
1063,0.97,7254.08,7255.181,The recognition here is alternative.,183,,
1064,0.97,7255.181,7256.349,Duwamish 1A for the South crossing.,183,,
1065,0.97,7256.349,7263.489,This is currently the preferred alternative identified in the Deis.,183,,
1066,0.97,7263.489,7264.59,Go ahead to the next slide.,183,,
1067,0.97,7264.59,7279.572,"So the rationale for this recommendation is that there are alternatives that are, the South crossing, which is south of the existing West Seattle bridge structure.",183,,
1068,0.97,7279.572,7282.208,There is also an alternative that is north of that structure.,183,,
1069,0.97,7282.208,7283.042,The North crossing.,183,,
1070,0.97,7283.042,7299.792,And that the transit seven identify the impact to the North crossing alternative to the Maritime businesses would be not possible to relocate and mitigate the impact to those businesses.,183,,
1071,0.97,7299.792,7324.083,"Of important note, the South crossing does come with environmental and community impact that were identified in the Deis and we certainly heard during community engagement, including the significant adverse impact of pigeon point and we will be working with sound transit to demonstrate Adeuate avoidance of the impact.",183,,
1072,0.97,7324.083,7337.997,"What we heard consistent with that rationale, concerns with the impact to the Maritime industrial businesses, will be associated with the North crossing and concerns of tribal impact near and in the Duwamish.",184,,
1073,0.97,7337.997,7346.105,Concerns about impact associated with the South crossings to the West Duwamish Greenbelt and crude--including tree loss.,184,,
1074,0.97,7346.105,7348.274,One last slide on this before we pause for discussion.,184,,
1075,0.97,7348.274,7348.808,Additional work needed.,184,,
1076,0.97,7348.808,7357.883,"Under the section four f, sound transit is required to mitigate the impact to the West Duwamish Greenbelt.",184,,
1077,0.97,7357.883,7365.591,These are the impacts at pigeon point including impacts to the blue parent habitat included in this photo here.,184,,
1078,0.97,7365.591,7381.04,We will be working with them on that between the Deis and the Feis and demonstrate slope for any sleep--steep slope as it comes across the Duwamish and into the (Indiscernible) point.,184,,
1079,0.97,7381.04,7388.581,And we will also be working to ensure compatibility for the West Seattle bridge.,184,,
1080,0.97,7388.581,7394.453,We will pause for discussion.,185,,
1081,0.97,7394.453,7395.554,Thank you very much.,186,,
1082,0.97,7395.554,7403.395,I was very thorough and outlining the rationale for various preferences.,186,,
1083,0.97,7403.395,7405.798,Our District Council members are such priceless resources for something like this.,186,,
1084,0.97,7405.798,7413.839,They know the districts better than anyone else and have been talking to their constituents for years.,186,,
1085,0.97,7413.839,7421.18,We want to first see if this impacts district 1 and District 2.,186,,
1086,0.97,7421.18,7428.821,I wanted to see if Councilmember Herbold had any questions or comments at this point.,186,,
1087,0.97,7428.821,7429.455,Sure.,187,,
1088,0.97,7429.455,7429.955,Thank you.,187,,
1089,0.97,7429.955,7432.525,Starting with the positive first.,187,,
1090,0.97,7432.525,7448.107,"We appreciate, as it leads to the Andover station, the Attentin to the need to minimize potential conflict between pedestrians and great movements in the station area.",187,,
1091,0.97,7448.107,7469.528,We appreciate recognition that there is divided community perspective at the Duwamish crossing and the language stating that there must be adequate mitigation of impact to habitat at pigeon point and the West Duwamish Greenbelt.,187,,
1092,0.97,7469.528,7481.14,"And no one to say, for Delridge, I do appreciate that there was additional language added to the draft resolution emphasizing how important transit access is for the area.",187,,
1093,0.97,7481.14,7504.396,"And emphasizing again the need, not only for a transit access study but the need for additional protection for Longfellow Creek and the environmental justice analysis in the draft EIS only going a half-mile from the station locations and those identified in the right are further to the South.",187,,
1094,0.97,7504.396,7528.187,As it relates to the effect that there is still a lot of concern and lack of clear community consensus in the Delridge community about the support for D6 . all the options have had clear impact on residents and businesses.,187,,
1095,0.97,7528.187,7544.503,And we have recently heard a lot of community opposition from the community and I want to reflect . Now it seems like ancient history.,187,,
1096,0.97,7544.503,7551.377,The option some of us worked on developing to address concerns we are hearing now which is the purple option.,187,,
1097,0.97,7551.377,7559.885,Not moved forward by the sound transit board for inclusion in the draft EIS.,187,,
1098,0.97,7559.885,7568.294,"The route Dell five and six, to minimize impact on the Youngtown community come with stations at Andover.",187,,
1099,0.97,7568.294,7625.117,"We are hearing so much about other--not considered to my understanding, impacts to Childcare access, significant impact on Childcare access for a Peninsula that has a lot of Childcare needs and a real lack of capacity, losing 300 Childcare spots on the peninsula would have a serious impact and I think it needs to be looked at as an impact to the entire Peninsula and not just sort of a localized impact that you might think of when you consider impacts to businesses or residents.",187,,
1100,0.97,7625.117,7630.389,"I think the broader impacts, given the capacity issues for child care really need to be considered.",187,,
1101,0.97,7630.389,7636.695,There is another we recently heard of transitional resources.,187,,
1102,0.97,7636.695,7642.401,Another important facility that would be affected.,187,,
1103,0.97,7642.401,7655.147,They offer 24 hour a day seven day a week services to folks who need serious mental health assistance.,187,,
1104,0.97,7655.147,7676.201,"They have living facilities in a service center and the location and as I understand it, there is a Time-Based Covenant on the property that requires them to use the property as identified in the Covenant for several decades.",187,,
1105,0.97,7676.201,7703.495,"So just wanting to understand how, given that these alternatives have come out of a lot of work everyone is doing to minimize impacts to community and with the racial equity Toolkit emphasis, but the reality is that this is the only option that connects to the tunnel.",187,,
1106,0.97,7703.495,7724.183,"That puts us all in a position that if we are supporting the West Seattle junction tunnel, then we have to support this option that has a lot of impact that I'm concerned have not been properly analyzed.",187,,
1107,0.97,7724.183,7744.57,"And I'm throwing this out there, much like we have stated no preference for the options in the Cid, I want to take some time over the next couple of weeks to consider a similar approach for the Delridge segment.",187,,
1108,0.97,7744.57,7751.877,Thank you Councilmember Herbold.,188,,
1109,0.97,7751.877,7753.178,"Sara and Marshall, did you want to respond to that?",188,,
1110,0.97,7753.178,7758.617,"I will say briefly Councilmember, that I appreciate the point of view on that.",189,,
1111,0.97,7758.617,7762.988,It is a very difficult decision as Sara was describing.,189,,
1112,0.97,7762.988,7767.626,One of the hardest and the whole quarter.,189,,
1113,0.97,7767.626,7769.428,That is an idea that has a lot of merit.,189,,
1114,0.97,7769.428,7773.999,It is very difficult challenge.,189,,
1115,0.97,7773.999,7781.006,I will say you brought the tunnel and the reality of the connection there.,189,,
1116,0.97,7781.006,7782.241,That is important.,189,,
1117,0.97,7782.241,7795.387,"I want to Reemphasize for us the Ret analysis, the residential Displacements and the Youngtown community and the impact of the aerial structure on Delridge and Tennessee were major drivers.",189,,
1118,0.97,7795.387,7797.022,Obviously those are points we can debate and discuss.,189,,
1119,0.97,7797.022,7803.595,That is really what was driving that concern.,189,,
1120,0.97,7803.595,7811.637,"I will just concur that the staff work and the staff recommendation was for this alternative, regardless of where it connected.",190,,
1121,0.97,7811.637,7830.823,"The step process we looked at was looking at each segment in isolation first and then did the pros and Cons and then advanced this one as Marshall mentioned, because of those impacted with the elevated structure.",190,,
1122,0.97,7830.823,7831.823,"Thank you, Sara.",191,,
1123,0.97,7831.823,7844.203,I appreciate the understanding of that dynamic and that support for the medium tunnel did not drive the selection of this alternative.,191,,
1124,0.97,7844.203,7846.104,Thank you Councilmember Herbold.,192,,
1125,0.97,7846.104,7850.542,I know Calvin chow also stands by ready as a resource to provide input.,192,,
1126,0.97,7850.542,7857.349,"Councilmember, are there any other comments on this particular item before we move on to the next segment?",192,,
1127,0.97,7857.349,7873.098,Let's move on to the next segment.,192,,
1128,0.97,7873.865,7875.5,I will start talking.,193,,
1129,0.97,7875.5,7886.912,Will move to the Codo and Cid segments that were grouped together for the purpose of the community advisory group that we looked at together and we will walk you through each segment.,193,,
1130,0.97,7886.912,7889.881,Starting with the Sodo segments.,193,,
1131,0.97,7889.881,7900.158,We will head to the next slides.,193,,
1132,0.97,7900.158,7903.395,The alternatives all follow the same alignment but provide for slightly different configurations of the station itself.,193,,
1133,0.97,7903.395,7920.445,The city recommendation is the draft recommendation for Sodo 1B at this Outstation option that would have the new station closer to Landers Street and would also move the existing station closer to Lander street.,193,,
1134,0.97,7920.445,7929.888,It would also include a new vehicular Overpass at Lander and Colgate.,193,,
1135,0.97,7929.888,7940.165,The rationale for this was from a safety and user experience perspective providing for better access from Lander street to the station areas and from a community standpoint consistent with what we heard from the D.A.,193,,
1136,0.97,7940.165,7954.68,And others avoiding the displacement associated with alternatives that were for the North.,193,,
1137,0.97,7954.68,7970.562,"Will be heard to the advisor process as well as through conversations with community members and business owners and the broader community support and from the business community, both to improve the station access and to avoid the business Displacements.",193,,
1138,0.97,7970.562,7979.404,We have heard concern about the design of the Lander Overpass and reduced access to the properties on Lander between fourth and sixth.,193,,
1139,0.97,7979.404,7983.475,As well as concerns about construction impacted businesses and mobility.,193,,
1140,0.97,7983.475,8005.33,This includes not only the roadways but also the existing buses that come to the area as well as the Sodo trail an opportunity to think about the impact on the long-term restoration of the Sodo trail.,193,,
1141,0.97,8005.497,8010.702,Most of these images are from the Deis or sound transit to be noted on each slide.,193,,
1142,0.97,8010.702,8023.448,This is a cross-section of the suggestive--recommended station upgrade without Lander Overpass.,193,,
1143,0.97,8023.448,8040.499,We have additional work needed to design the Lander and Colgate Street Overpass is to design them at acceptable grades for safe transport and to ensure that the intersection elevation where the Overpasses connect can accommodate all vehicle types.,193,,
1144,0.97,8040.499,8052.611,And then planning for the long- term restoration of the Sodo trail as an opportunity.,193,,
1145,0.97,8052.611,8054.079,To the next slide.,194,,
1146,0.97,8054.079,8055.647,This goes to the Chinatown International district.,194,,
1147,0.97,8055.647,8062.888,The International district is one of our Ret priority communities identified through the multi-year Ret process with sound transit.,194,,
1148,0.97,8062.888,8072.33,The reclamation right now is that no decision should be made on a preferred alternative at this time.,194,,
1149,0.97,8072.33,8088.58,The Cid was the only segment for which a preferred alternative was not identified in advance of the Deis for the very reason that not enough engagement had been done with community to understand the impact and implications of these alternatives.,194,,
1150,0.97,8088.58,8105.497,And we provide ourselves with additional analysis and additional voice from community saying that we need to get additional information before we can make a decision.,194,,
1151,0.97,8105.497,8112.838,The construction and transportation impacts and what strategies are necessary to mitigate them needs to be understood.,194,,
1152,0.97,8112.838,8115.607,"Of note, there are significant cultural and racial impacts of any alternate for this community.",194,,
1153,0.97,8115.607,8137.929,The city position or the recommended draft position in the Council ordinances that we must work with community to better understand the impact and better understand how they would be mitigated and what solutions can exist before supporting the alternative.,194,,
1154,0.97,8137.929,8153.979,"What is recommended for additional work is to advance a focused six like a nine-month planning process with the Chinatown international community and Pioneer square community members and other partner organizations including sound transit, King County Metro and others.",194,,
1155,0.97,8153.979,8161.686,One to more fully address community concerns with the existing alternatives.,194,,
1156,0.97,8161.686,8166.892,And identify appropriate strategies to avoid minimizing and mitigating the impact associated with them.,194,,
1157,0.97,8166.892,8179.037,"Second, to identify possible modifications to the fourth Avenue South and Fifth Avenue South that could reduce the impact, the community harm and the costs associated with it.",194,,
1158,0.97,8179.037,8200.125,"Third, to initiate a broader community development strategy discussion and to discuss how the project can be part of that that would further the right outcomes for the community and address the projects, cumulative impact and address the historic harm.",194,,
1159,0.97,8200.125,8200.892,To the next slide please.,194,,
1160,0.97,8200.892,8216.141,A little bit of a deep dive into the impact and what we have heard and the rationale about the fourth Avenue South and Fifth Avenue South alternatives starting with the fifth Avenue South alternatives from a safety standpoint and from a community standpoint.,195,,
1161,0.97,8216.141,8230.422,Those advancing those core values and hearing from community members and businesses that have voiced strong concerns about the significant impacts of the fifth Avenue South alternatives including the significant permanent Displacements.,195,,
1162,0.97,8230.422,8243.702,"In this image come on this slide, is a composite image of information provided of the community advisory groups about permanent Displacements and part of the Cid community.",195,,
1163,0.97,8243.702,8250.842,All the parcels highlighted would be permanently displaced as part of the fifth Avenue South alternatives.,195,,
1164,0.97,8250.842,8251.676,To the next slide.,195,,
1165,0.97,8251.676,8266.191,"Concerns, rationale and concerns about the (Indiscernible)--this would be a station that would be further removed from the heart of the Cid community located underneath the current Viaduct structure on the fourth Avenue Southbridge.",195,,
1166,0.97,8266.191,8283.975,"From a safety community and stewardship standpoint, we can ask to mitigate the nine plus years of construction and road closures and high costs associated with these alternatives.",195,,
1167,0.97,8283.975,8294.152,This picture is from the community advisory group meeting that Showcases some of the partial and full road closures anticipated with this alternative.,195,,
1168,0.97,8294.152,8313.171,"Of note, there would be the Six- year closure on fourth Avenue South which would be staggered with partial closures that would require the diversion of all of the traffic, transit and general-purpose traffic off of fourth Avenue South on to sixth Avenue through the existing community or over to first Avenue South.",195,,
1169,0.97,8313.171,8320.645,It also would include the four year closure of the intersection of main and fourth.,195,,
1170,0.97,8320.645,8328.453,And that is where all the trolley buses coming from throughout the southeast of Seattle come through that intersection.,195,,
1171,0.97,8328.453,8338.53,"So all the trolley buses, which include the (Indiscernible) and the 36 which are bus lines heavily utilized by the local community.",195,,
1172,0.97,8338.53,8348.606,They would be diverted and would have an impact for at least the four years of that closure as well as likely during throughout the entire decades long construction anticipated.,195,,
1173,0.97,8348.606,8354.479,"Looking for additional strategies to minimize, avoid and mitigate the impacts.",195,,
1174,0.97,8354.479,8364.022,What we have heard from community.,195,,
1175,0.97,8364.022,8372.263,We have concern about the historic harm to this community from generations of projects that have been built in the community but not for the community.,196,,
1176,0.97,8372.263,8386.511,"This is one in a long line of projects of Stadiums, streetcar, navigation center and there have been cumulative impact associated with these projects and the community has been experiencing historic harm.",196,,
1177,0.97,8386.511,8393.051,We also have heard--there has not been support for the deep alternatives.,196,,
1178,0.97,8393.051,8403.728,"As a reminder, the alternatives on the table for fourth Avenue South and Fifth Avenue South have a shallow configuration as well as a deep configuration.",196,,
1179,0.97,8403.728,8405.196,The deep stations would require elevator only access.,196,,
1180,0.97,8405.196,8414.973,And particularly during events at the Stadium likely causing congestion.,196,,
1181,0.97,8414.973,8425.617,We have heard concerns about the fifth Avenue South alternatives and the impact to the heart of the Cid community as well as support for the alternatives.,196,,
1182,0.97,8425.617,8434.659,In particular because of a winning the fifth Avenue South impact and because it would better connect to the Pioneer square community.,196,,
1183,0.97,8434.659,8435.994,We are going to pause there.,197,,
1184,0.97,8435.994,8443.234,The next slide was already featured Upfront for Chinatown International district.,197,,
1185,0.97,8443.234,8448.473,I want to pause and see if Marshall wants to add anything before we open for discussion.,197,,
1186,0.97,8448.473,8469.06,I want to underscore how much community engagement has taken place on this and frankly a huge appreciation for the amount of volunteer time that this community has put into engaging the sound transit in the city and the level of passion to preserve the District and finding ways to allow this station as needed and to do it in a way that is far less Impactful.,198,,
1187,0.97,8469.06,8482.774,It has become kind of a paramount message we have heard them so we are working to open up the space to be able to do that well here we do want to acknowledge that sound transit has been there.,198,,
1188,0.97,8482.774,8485.176,They have been listening and have been part of the discussion.,198,,
1189,0.97,8485.176,8493.952,A lot of it is not having had the time yet frankly to really do that deep dive work in the community.,198,,
1190,0.97,8493.952,8499.457,Having only gotten the EIS out in January and the comments in April.,198,,
1191,0.97,8499.457,8500.625,Thank you very much.,199,,
1192,0.97,8500.625,8510.502,"Councilmember Morales, did you have any comments on this one at this time?",199,,
1193,0.97,8510.502,8512.437,I just want to thank the team here.,200,,
1194,0.97,8512.437,8514.372,We have been and pretty regular conversation over the last few months.,200,,
1195,0.97,8514.372,8526.518,And really appreciate your willingness to keep my office is up-to-date the kinds of community engagements happening and the kind of interaction and conversations happening with sound transit.,200,,
1196,0.97,8526.518,8567.358,"I do think that, we know there will be impact regardless of which option is chosen and I appreciate the steadfastness of your supporting the community and saying that we cannot make a decision right now because there is not enough information available to explain, not just with the impact of this will be fully But even more importantly, what mitigation strategies are you willing to commit to, sound transit, so that we can make a decision?",200,,
1197,0.97,8567.358,8573.298,I think will--that will be the important thing for the next 62Nd nine months for conversation.,200,,
1198,0.97,8573.298,8587.412,"I just want to express my gratitude to all of you for the work you are doing to make sure that with the community's hearing, is getting as much information as possible so they can choose which way to go.",200,,
1199,0.97,8587.412,8590.181,Thank you Councilmember Morales.,201,,
1200,0.97,8590.181,8593.318,I think we can move on to the next segment.,201,,
1201,0.97,8593.318,8596.354,Can I make one Q█Uick comment.,202,,
1202,0.97,8596.354,8597.522,"Sorry, Councilmember.",202,,
1203,0.97,8597.522,8604.595,One thing that I think is important to recognize is how important the connection between this location is to the larger system.,202,,
1204,0.97,8604.595,8610.034,I think people know that but I want to emphasize what is needed to make that connection.,202,,
1205,0.97,8610.034,8617.642,The sound transit strategy and approach is that that needs to happen in the Cid for obvious reasons in terms of the alignment.,202,,
1206,0.97,8617.642,8621.245,I wanted to bring that bigger reach home as well.,202,,
1207,0.97,8621.245,8627.986,Thank you.,203,,
1208,0.97,8627.986,8628.386,Please continue.,203,,
1209,0.97,8628.386,8628.987,Thank you.,204,,
1210,0.97,8628.987,8639.664,We will move (Indiscernible) downtown now.,204,,
1211,0.97,8639.664,8643.468,The Deis treats downtown as one log segment with five stations.,204,,
1212,0.97,8643.468,8657.448,We will break it down for the purposes of discussion into three Subsegments including the Midtown and Westlake station and then the Denny and South Lake Union station and then the Seattle center station before moving into the South inner Bay.,204,,
1213,0.97,8657.448,8659.684,So move ahead to the next slide.,204,,
1214,0.97,8659.684,8661.085,The recommendation is for a Mix- And-Match approach.,204,,
1215,0.97,8661.085,8671.396,The current Deis alternatives one and two offer different stations that provide different levels of access and certainly different impact.,204,,
1216,0.97,8671.396,8687.578,"So the approach here is to select stations from across the two alignments, the one in two alignments that would access and minimize impact and harm.",204,,
1217,0.97,8687.578,8688.98,Next slide.,204,,
1218,0.97,8688.98,8700.758,"Starting with Midtown and West Lake from the South end of the segment, really going through the heart of the retail and office area of downtown, the recommendation is for the two stations, Dt1.",204,,
1219,0.97,8700.758,8706.23,This would be a tunnel at Midtown and the tunnel at Westlake at Fifth Avenue.,204,,
1220,0.97,8706.23,8715.94,"Starting with the rationale before moving on to what we heard from the community, this is a picture of the Midtown station at sixth.",204,,
1221,0.97,8715.94,8721.412,This is a rendering of what we are not proposing.,204,,
1222,0.97,8721.412,8754.846,"From a safety and user experience, the alternative for Midtown at fifth instead of six would avoid pedestrian and vehicle conflict at this spring and Seneca Juarez--Interstate five ramps shown here in this image as well as avoiding a deep station elevator access please . The Chinatown International district station is a transfer point please between the one, two and three line.",204,,
1223,0.97,8754.846,8770.561,"So thinking about that transfer environment, there is a slightly shorter transfer distance at Westlake associated with the Dt1 option.",204,,
1224,0.97,8770.561,8771.062,Next slide.,204,,
1225,0.97,8771.062,8773.164,Concerns we have heard.,204,,
1226,0.97,8773.164,8774.332,Concerns about access from first help.,204,,
1227,0.97,8774.332,8781.606,So acknowledging the first Hill was bypassed by the original construction of the current system.,204,,
1228,0.97,8781.606,8792.15,"And the first Hill, the areas of first Hill, we would be able to access the system and look for opportunities to provide or improve the access.",204,,
1229,0.97,8792.15,8796.154,I have also heard concerns about access to the very deep stations.,204,,
1230,0.97,8796.154,8808.733,This is a picture from the Deis of the Midtown station that would it be accessible only in a station over 200 feet.,204,,
1231,0.97,8808.733,8811.802,We also heard concerns about safe pedestrian access which are steep slope areas of downtown.,204,,
1232,0.97,8811.802,8819.677,Really wanting to ensure they have the safest pedestrian access as possible.,204,,
1233,0.97,8819.677,8819.977,Next slide.,204,,
1234,0.97,8819.977,8821.379,Additional work needed.,205,,
1235,0.97,8821.379,8826.217,This is a rendering of the Midtown station or a map of the Midtown station at Fifth Avenue.,205,,
1236,0.97,8826.217,8834.058,This would connect to the rapid G line on Madison Street which would be an important transfer bringing people into the system.,205,,
1237,0.97,8834.058,8840.832,We are looking for opportunities to optimize communities.,205,,
1238,0.97,8840.832,8857.715,And ensure vertical circulation in the station and possibly study horizontal axis from third Avenue so we would provide access to the station at a lower level that would be horizontal.,205,,
1239,0.97,8857.715,8858.983,Next slide.,205,,
1240,0.97,8858.983,8887.011,"Moving further North in the segment to the Denny and South Lake Union stations, the recommendations will be a mix and match approach coming from Dt1 and veer over to Dt2 for the Denny and tunnel station at Útunnel Street and then moved back to Dt1 for the Southlake tunnel station at Harrison Street which requires multiple Mix-And-Match from what is in the Deis currently.",205,,
1241,0.97,8887.011,8893.618,"Of note, both of these stations would provide access to Southlake Union which is the fastest growing center in the United region.",205,,
1242,0.97,8893.618,8904.161,"With a growth of 5400 housing units and 40,000 jobs since 2015.",205,,
1243,0.97,8904.161,8904.495,Next please.,205,,
1244,0.97,8904.495,8907.498,The rationale here from safety committee and stewardship standpoint.,206,,
1245,0.97,8907.498,8926.25,This is a rendering of the recommended station for Southlake Union at Harrison and Seventh pick the station would optimize transit integration and safest route access from the Aurora corridor and Southlake Union.,206,,
1246,0.97,8926.25,8933.424,"So all the buses coming down are rural as well as connecting to Harrison street, which is a transit priority, a corridor identified in the city's long- term plans.",206,,
1247,0.97,8933.424,8942.233,So providing for that optimal trend immigration at that point and safe access as folks are moving from the bus to the system.,206,,
1248,0.97,8942.233,8953.144,"From a safety and community standpoint, supporting access and Aligning with the Terry Avenue green street, that is at the Denny station.",206,,
1249,0.97,8953.144,8954.478,And then community and safety standpoint.,206,,
1250,0.97,8954.478,8957.515,This Mix-And-Match approach would avoid the station--the Denny station,206,,
1251,0.97,8976.167,8979.27,We have heard a strong support for the Harrison station.,207,,
1252,0.97,8979.27,8980.705,Is identified as a transit Hub.,207,,
1253,0.97,8980.705,8991.349,As well as numerous concerns about access to the Dt2 South Lakes Union station.,207,,
1254,0.97,8991.349,8992.416,It would not have pedestrian access.,207,,
1255,0.97,8992.416,9000.224,And concern about this alternative that we are seeking to avoid.,207,,
1256,0.97,9000.224,9006.63,The transportation impacts associate with construction of the West Lake.,207,,
1257,0.97,9006.63,9006.831,Dt1.,207,,
1258,0.97,9006.831,9009.667,That would require a four year a full closure of Westlake Avenue.,207,,
1259,0.97,9009.667,9011.135,Through the Amazon campus.,207,,
1260,0.97,9011.135,9015.94,It would close down nearly 2 blocks for four years.,207,,
1261,0.97,9015.94,9024.882,"So the general purpose traffic, bike and existing bus lines would be relegated and diverted elsewhere.",207,,
1262,0.97,9024.882,9031.956,This is really seeking to avoid that closure of Westlake.,207,,
1263,0.97,9031.956,9039.73,And multi-year closure . and complete of the South Union Street corridor.,207,,
1264,0.97,9039.73,9040.765,Additional work needed.,207,,
1265,0.97,9040.765,9050.374,This is a map that is pulled from our South Lake Union Triangle mobility plan.,207,,
1266,0.97,9050.374,9055.913,Identifies this very spot as a transit Hub.,207,,
1267,0.97,9055.913,9058.949,We are looking for continued study of the Mix-And-Match refinements to support this.,207,,
1268,0.97,9058.949,9068.692,This has additional work that this mix and match alternative can work.,207,,
1269,0.97,9068.692,9074.932,We are looking for of course transit integration.,207,,
1270,0.97,9074.932,9077.168,So many other committees would be impacted throughout the city.,207,,
1271,0.97,9077.168,9080.671,We are looking to ensure functional transit during construction.,207,,
1272,0.97,9080.671,9095.92,And at the Denny's station really looking for providing safe access on both sides of Denny . moving on in the segment to Seattle center.,207,,
1273,0.97,9095.92,9108.365,The draft recommendation is for Dt2 at the tunnel station at Mercer street.,207,,
1274,0.97,9108.365,9108.933,Of note.,207,,
1275,0.97,9108.933,9109.333,On this map.,207,,
1276,0.97,9109.333,9109.934,The neighborhood context.,207,,
1277,0.97,9109.934,9115.272,While this is the Addle this is meant to provide critically needed and the benefit of transit service.,207,,
1278,0.97,9115.272,9123.914,To the highest visited location in the entire region.,207,,
1279,0.97,9123.914,9125.149,12 million visitors per year.,207,,
1280,0.97,9125.149,9129.487,Of course the city of Seattle is the primary property owner to the cultural residential.,207,,
1281,0.97,9129.487,9144.535,And the campus . It is also provide the access to the uptown urban center.,207,,
1282,0.97,9144.535,9146.003,The fastest in the city in the region.,207,,
1283,0.97,9146.003,9151.942,"This station is going to be writing access to that rapidly growing neighborhood, as well.",207,,
1284,0.97,9151.942,9152.576,Rationale for this.,207,,
1285,0.97,9152.576,9153.978,It is from a community standpoint.,207,,
1286,0.97,9153.978,9159.35,Avoiding some of the impact to the sensitive universe.,207,,
1287,0.97,9159.35,9161.619,Those supporting organizations on the Seattle center campus.,207,,
1288,0.97,9161.619,9166.757,Adjacent to the alternative.,207,,
1289,0.97,9166.757,9168.425,From a safety and user experience spend point.,207,,
1290,0.97,9168.425,9185.142,Providing access and a station would give station Entrances North and south of Mercersburg that gives access to the Seattle center campus as well as safe access to the neighborhoods.,207,,
1291,0.97,9185.142,9187.011,This is about bridging the campus and the neighborhood.,207,,
1292,0.97,9187.011,9192.149,Making a station that would be meaningful to both.,207,,
1293,0.97,9192.149,9193.484,From an environmental standpoint.,207,,
1294,0.97,9193.484,9199.757,The legacy would be impacted by the alternative.,207,,
1295,0.97,9199.757,9207.331,And this alternative would also provide greater equitable development.,207,,
1296,0.97,9207.331,9214.572,Along Mercer.,207,,
1297,0.97,9214.572,9216.14,And what we have heard from community.,207,,
1298,0.97,9216.14,9219.376,This is a picture owner the first in person events we were able to do.,207,,
1299,0.97,9219.376,9222.479,During the pandemic.,207,,
1300,0.97,9222.479,9227.218,With resident organizations and community members . and uptown and Seattle center.,207,,
1301,0.97,9227.218,9235.292,"We had a great deal to impact its features, structures and the campus.",207,,
1302,0.97,9235.292,9239.597,Displacement of resident organizations during the many years of construction.,207,,
1303,0.97,9239.597,9245.002,Concerns about the temporary and permanent ways and the vibration impact.,207,,
1304,0.97,9245.002,9249.039,"Part of me to sensitive, cultural Venues that are recording.",207,,
1305,0.97,9249.039,9256.113,And Accessing impact.,207,,
1306,0.97,9256.113,9259.416,Making sure there is access to businesses and the organizations during the construction period.,207,,
1307,0.97,9259.416,9260.451,Additional work needed.,207,,
1308,0.97,9260.451,9267.024,This picture is a rendering of that mix and match alignment.,207,,
1309,0.97,9267.024,9269.727,It would go from the South Lake Union Dt2 to Harrison.,207,,
1310,0.97,9269.727,9275.833,To the Dt2 at Seattle center at Mercer.,207,,
1311,0.97,9275.833,9280.671,Additional work with sound transit to study that refinement.,207,,
1312,0.97,9280.671,9286.443,And additional work to maintain the vehicle mobility and business access on the Mercer corridor.,207,,
1313,0.97,9286.443,9297.321,That is said transportation impacts in the past.,207,,
1314,0.97,9297.321,9298.856,Also thinking not just about mitigating impact.,207,,
1315,0.97,9298.856,9300.557,"But also the impact of the detours, themselves.",207,,
1316,0.97,9300.557,9303.827,Helping create constructions access plans for those organizations that follow that.,207,,
1317,0.97,9303.827,9313.17,Ensuring that we are avoiding and mitigating operational noise and vibration.,207,,
1318,0.97,9313.17,9319.743,Meeting standards necessary for those organizations to continue including the Seattle opera and the ballet.,207,,
1319,0.97,9319.743,9323.314,Sufficiently accommodating.,207,,
1320,0.97,9323.314,9326.016,This is an area that is a large event.,207,,
1321,0.97,9326.016,9335.592,We are mindful just as Chinatown International.,207,,
1322,0.97,9335.592,9339.63,That the Stadium is able to accommodate the flow of pedestrian traffic coming in and out of those events.,207,,
1323,0.97,9339.63,9343.1,Connecting to the pivotal station.,207,,
1324,0.97,9343.1,9352.576,I think that closes out our downtown segment.,207,,
1325,0.97,9352.576,9353.41,Just a quick comment.,208,,
1326,0.97,9353.41,9355.512,Could we go back just one moment?,208,,
1327,0.97,9355.512,9361.018,I wanted to use that refinement idea as an example.,208,,
1328,0.97,9361.018,9361.585,The Mix-And-Match.,208,,
1329,0.97,9361.585,9372.696,The green line connecting South Lake Union to the station.,208,,
1330,0.97,9372.696,9376.033,That is a good example of the power of making some refinements to the alternatives.,208,,
1331,0.97,9376.033,9376.633,Help resolve the impacts.,208,,
1332,0.97,9376.633,9377.234,In the community.,208,,
1333,0.97,9377.234,9380.704,And I want to highlight it . It is an example of the creativity where looking for.,208,,
1334,0.97,9380.704,9388.178,We have had a number of people comment . The fact that we are looking at different refinements in different parts of the city.,208,,
1335,0.97,9388.178,9391.448,But yet to look at the community.,208,,
1336,0.97,9391.448,9394.351,At the particular situation.,208,,
1337,0.97,9394.351,9396.053,I want to use that as an example.,208,,
1338,0.97,9396.053,9399.456,From the previous discussion.,208,,
1339,0.97,9399.456,9401.291,"Thank you, very much.",209,,

1343,0.97,9421.378,9422.646,To talk about this alignment.,210,,
1344,0.97,9422.646,9422.88,First.,210,,
1345,0.97,9422.88,9423.514,Let me start.,210,,

1349,0.97,9437.494,9439.563,"For this particular segment, there is a lot of alignment.",210,,
1350,0.97,9439.563,9441.799,The only thing that I would flag for this Union station.,210,,
1351,0.97,9441.799,9453.21,I have received a number of constituent requests to talk about potential mitigation.,210,,
1352,0.97,9453.21,9463.887,"And it is more for our relationship with sound transit . Then it is that we, ourselves are in the position to do . But we have an important facilitating role.",210,,
1353,0.97,9463.887,9471.428,I would like to spend some time.,210,,
1354,0.97,9471.428,9472.996,How a station will interact with the neighborhood.,210,,
1355,0.97,9472.996,9475.032,Some of the concerns of some of the potential businesses.,210,,
1356,0.97,9475.032,9476.867,At face displacement.,210,,
1357,0.97,9476.867,9478.268,Depending on how it is implemented.,210,,
1358,0.97,9478.268,9482.806,I want to echo . The careful attention.,210,,
1359,0.97,9482.806,9483.106,The focus.,210,,
1360,0.97,9483.106,9492.416,I really appreciated from Wsdot and the uptown neighborhood.,210,,
1361,0.97,9492.416,9500.29,It is been extremely critical area of focus for our arts community tenants.,210,,
1362,0.97,9500.29,9507.13,"There really, really concerned about the possible Republican Street station.",210,,
1363,0.97,9507.13,9519.042,"I appreciate, very much the highlighting of Mercer . in a note of the uptown alliance in community is in alignment with us, as well.",210,,
1364,0.97,9519.042,9523.78,That is a very big priority in the city wing and the process for me.,210,,
1365,0.97,9523.78,9532.923,To make sure that we are doing everything we can to fight for that Mercer alignment in the uptown neighborhood.,210,,
1366,0.97,9532.923,9533.457,I appreciate that.,210,,
1367,0.97,9533.457,9539.096,And I look forward to talking further . with some of the South Lake Union constituents.,210,,
1368,0.97,9539.096,9549.273,On some of our alignment thoughts in that area.,210,,
1369,0.97,9549.273,9550.34,"Thank you, Councilmember Lewis.",211,,
1370,0.97,9550.34,9555.479,Are there any other questions or comments before we move on?,211,,
1371,0.97,9555.479,9560.817,Moving on to South Interbay and the Ballard segment.,212,,
1372,0.97,9560.817,9567.624,This system exits . The Seattle center station.,212,,
1373,0.97,9567.624,9569.426,Moving through a tunnel portal as an elevated structure.,212,,
1374,0.97,9569.426,9571.495,Through Smith Cove.,212,,
1375,0.97,9571.495,9577.1,Portions and continuing North.,212,,
1376,0.97,9577.1,9580.337,To alternatives that would be elevated or a tunnel.,212,,
1377,0.97,9580.337,9586.443,And this gives you a sneak Peek.,212,,
1378,0.97,9586.443,9588.679,The red circle tells you what is ahead for South Interbay.,212,,
1379,0.97,9588.679,9592.916,The South Interbay segment.,212,,
1380,0.97,9592.916,9597.154,The recommendation at this time.,212,,
1381,0.97,9597.154,9606.697,There is not sufficient information related to some key impacts associate with the construction.,212,,
1382,0.97,9606.697,9609.766,And the permanent operation of the elevated highway through South Interbay area.,212,,
1383,0.97,9609.766,9621.678,And Elliott Avenue West . and the impact to the environmental impact area for the city to make a recommendation.,212,,
1384,0.97,9621.678,9623.146,And we will go more in depth.,212,,
1385,0.97,9623.146,9633.223,To some of the concerns . There are three alternatives . for South Interbay.,212,,
1386,0.97,9633.223,9636.76,One that is currently preferred alternative to the Gaylord Street station.,212,,
1387,0.97,9636.76,9638.929,They would both have stations at prospect street.,212,,
1388,0.97,9638.929,9643.133,The first rationale concerns about the Elliott.,212,,
1389,0.97,9643.133,9650.741,This is alternatives Sib 1 exit at Republic.,212,,
1390,0.97,9650.741,9662.953,And come out with an elevated that would weave across Elliott way . and Elliott Avenue West.,212,,
1391,0.97,9662.953,9664.588,Three times in the course of one mile.,212,,
1392,0.97,9664.588,9677.0,"The impact of that structure would include many columns and structures that would be placed in the Right-Of-Way and the road, himself.",212,,
1393,0.97,9677.0,9679.97,Permanent removal of turn lanes for all of roadway users in that high-volume corridor.,212,,
1394,0.97,9679.97,9682.139,In these pictures.,212,,
1395,0.97,9682.139,9682.773,They have existing conditions.,212,,
1396,0.97,9682.773,9689.379,The picture on top is Linwood north of the Northgate station.,212,,
1397,0.97,9689.379,9695.152,It shows what is a straddle bend.,212,,
1398,0.97,9695.152,9697.821,With the columns that are placed on either side of the roadway.,212,,
1399,0.97,9697.821,9700.357,And there is a central link.,212,,
1400,0.97,9700.357,9700.757,Near Mlk.,212,,
1401,0.97,9700.757,9704.661,A column can come down and firmly remove a turning Lane.,212,,
1402,0.97,9704.661,9713.904,This gives us a sense . The site line obstructions that can be associated with those structures.,212,,
1403,0.97,9713.904,9720.11,"Meanwhile, Sib 2 from the elevated snake area.",212,,
1404,0.97,9720.11,9729.986,And meeting up where Sib 3 would impact the Southwest and queen and Greenbelt.,212,,
1405,0.97,9729.986,9734.691,That is a land slave prone Steve environment and a critical area.,212,,
1406,0.97,9734.691,9741.164,Land slide--. towards Elliott Avenue.,212,,
1407,0.97,9741.164,9746.369,That gives a sense of the Steepness of that slope.,212,,
1408,0.97,9746.369,9754.678,The landslide prone slope.,212,,
1409,0.97,9754.678,9755.512,Concerns that we have heard.,212,,
1410,0.97,9755.512,9757.28,Certainly concerned about freight mobility.,212,,
1411,0.97,9757.28,9762.953,This is a high-volume corridor.,212,,
1412,0.97,9762.953,9764.054,Identified as freight mobility corridor.,212,,
1413,0.97,9764.054,9773.363,Near industrial and Maritime uses . and continuing to provide for mobility through that corridor is of critical importance to the business sector.,212,,
1414,0.97,9773.363,9776.466,We have heard support for the Gaylord Smith station.,212,,
1415,0.97,9776.466,9785.408,Importance is that they is support.,212,,
1416,0.97,9785.408,9792.716,It is not necessarily the Guideway that gets us to the station is without problems or impact this still needs to be addressed.,212,,
1417,0.97,9792.716,9793.15,Next slide.,212,,
1418,0.97,9793.15,9794.384,Additional work needed.,212,,
1419,0.97,9794.384,9802.959,Steps related.,212,,
1420,0.97,9802.959,9803.76,For an alternative.,212,,

1500,0.97,10222.145,10227.817,Why this is so important to the Ballard and larger area communities.,214,,
1501,0.97,10227.817,10231.521,In district 6 the 14th Avenue alignment.,214,,
1502,0.97,10231.521,10242.532,It is not fit within these parameters.,214,,
1503,0.97,10242.532,10244.767,It is an area where we do not have additional housing.,214,,
1504,0.97,10244.767,10250.173,It is an area that does not have our input.,214,,
1505,0.97,10250.173,10255.812,It is geographically and physically separated from residential communities . I see in your resolution.,214,,
1506,0.97,10255.812,10266.689,We are asking that our preferred option . Our two choices is 15. but I would say that hearing from the community.,214,,

1510,0.97,10281.104,10283.339,There were some outstanding items that needed to be identified.,214,,
1511,0.97,10283.339,10287.81,For us to take a bit of a transition.,214,,
1512,0.97,10287.81,10298.454,There are items that were outside of the Deis . What we are changing? I would have a lot of different comments to provide.,214,,
1513,0.97,10298.454,10299.489,On this map before us.,214,,
1514,0.97,10299.489,10307.063,20th Avenue and 17th Avenue.,214,,

1518,0.97,10324.047,10324.881,To get to 14th?,214,,
1519,0.97,10324.881,10326.549,That is a 10 block walk.,214,,
1520,0.97,10326.549,10333.623,With a crossing of the most used corridor in the city.,214,,
1521,0.97,10333.623,10339.562,Only behind SR 99. not only are we asking people to walk 10 blocks.,214,,
1522,0.97,10339.562,10349.005,We are asking them to cross a next level down from Aurora.,214,,
1523,0.97,10349.005,10352.408,That is why section 1 item C is so important.,214,,
1524,0.97,10352.408,10364.62,"For me, I am not sure that 15th is my preference.",214,,
1525,0.97,10364.62,10366.255,"Out of the option between 14th, 15th, absolutely.",214,,
1526,0.97,10366.255,10369.625,That is only because 14th does not really fit the needs of our community.,214,,
1527,0.97,10369.625,10378.267,I am not sure . and maybe I ask you . and if you want to talk Online?,214,,

1531,0.97,10394.55,10403.426,Their original proposal was a 20th and 17th would serve the committee in a more Impactful way.,214,,
1532,0.97,10403.426,10410.166,"And honestly I want to work as partners . It is just as important to to the core of Ballard, Everett, Tacoma.",214,,
1533,0.97,10410.166,10417.507,This is a regional transportation . The only change that I will ask.,214,,
1534,0.97,10417.507,10431.02,Under section 2 item H. if we could make reference specifically to section C item 1. smack absolutely.,214,,
1535,0.97,10431.02,10443.433,Let me also - we have heard that question about the further West locations absolutely.,214,,
1536,0.97,10443.433,10444.033,Consistently and repeatedly.,214,,
1537,0.97,10444.033,10447.503,It is the most consistent things we've heard across the entire board.,214,,
1538,0.97,10447.503,10457.78,"I know that sound transit has heard that, as well we have Turkey about that we have some big decisions that were made at the board.",214,,
1539,0.97,10457.78,10459.582,That took those off the table.,214,,
1540,0.97,10459.582,10460.616,What we are emphasizing.,214,,
1541,0.97,10460.616,10461.45,And it is worth saying.,214,,
1542,0.97,10461.45,10463.519,15th is already in everyone's compass.,214,,
1543,0.97,10463.519,10467.089,From where the original compass was.,214,,
1544,0.97,10467.089,10471.494,That is not mean that we should cut -,214,,
1545,0.97,10471.494,10475.498,Your say the city is compromising?,215,,
1546,0.97,10475.498,10490.279,That is already further East than we would Ideally like to put up a railway station.,216,,
1547,0.97,10490.279,10494.383,We are holding a strong line that that is essential for the all of the reasons that Sarah described.,216,,
1548,0.97,10494.383,10495.218,Of course the basics.,216,,
1549,0.97,10495.218,10504.894,What is in the environmental document.,216,,
1550,0.97,10504.894,10506.495,That is something we can talk about more.,216,,
1551,0.97,10506.495,10508.998,What we are talking about advancing the program as it has been refined.,216,,
1552,0.97,10508.998,10510.666,But I feel like 15th is a Must- have.,216,,
1553,0.97,10510.666,10512.134,For those reasons that you just described.,216,,
1554,0.97,10512.134,10512.969,Yes.,217,,
1555,0.97,10512.969,10516.005,I would put it in a different way.,217,,
1556,0.97,10516.005,10517.139,14th is unacceptable.,217,,
1557,0.97,10517.139,10520.376,"But it goes without saying, the same thing.",217,,
1558,0.97,10520.376,10525.448,"Thank you, Councilmember Strauss.",218,,

1573,0.97,10603.926,10610.499,The absence of an exclusive endorsement of the alternative.,219,,
1574,0.97,10610.499,10623.512,Still endorses certain station locations and functions that we would like to see . But the ultimate alignment that is picked by sound transit.,219,,
1575,0.97,10623.512,10625.147,It seems and maybe Marshall.,219,,
1576,0.97,10625.147,10627.416,You can weigh in.,219,,
1577,0.97,10627.416,10634.423,The concerns about not endorsing the preferred alternative.,219,,
1578,0.97,10634.423,10644.5,Stem from the Elliott snake issue and putting pressure on transit to revise and fix that particular design and problem.,219,,
1579,0.97,10644.5,10650.639,Before we can go forward and explicitly find the options.,219,,
1580,0.97,10650.639,10651.907,But I do want to echo.,219,,

1586,0.97,10673.396,10689.045,This will allow for X efficient and ask radiant solutions to get to magnolia and other neighborhoods adjacent to those stations.,219,,
1587,0.97,10689.045,10690.146,And what that alignment provides.,219,,
1588,0.97,10690.146,10691.313,I have a few more comments.,219,,
1589,0.97,10691.313,10696.052,But I will hold right there.,219,,
1590,0.97,10696.052,10700.923,If Marshall or Sarah if you want to have a comment?,219,,
1591,0.97,10700.923,10703.726,"Mostly what is indicated on the slides 56, 57.",219,,
1592,0.97,10703.726,10709.065,Briefly.,220,,
1593,0.97,10709.065,10709.699,And I appreciate that.,220,,
1594,0.97,10709.699,10723.879,Your point about the station itself . The issues as you have described.,220,,
1595,0.97,10723.879,10725.347,Presented really are primarily around the Guideway.,220,,
1596,0.97,10725.347,10732.488,And how it has been laid out.,220,,
1597,0.97,10732.488,10733.923,Fundamentally in terms of city policy.,220,,
1598,0.97,10733.923,10735.558,It is not consistent to support something like that.,220,,
1599,0.97,10735.558,10741.831,People want to continue to work with Sdot and highlight the snake issue.,220,,
1600,0.97,10741.831,10749.538,So we can provide and support an alternative.,220,,
1601,0.97,10749.538,10750.873,Let me ask a clarifying question.,221,,
1602,0.97,10750.873,10751.607,To Marshall or Sarah.,221,,
1603,0.97,10751.607,10762.351,Where do we anticipate the tunnel coming out and turning into the Guideway on this map?,221,,
1604,0.97,10762.351,10766.689,When does is go from a tunnel to being on the surface?,221,,
1605,0.97,10766.689,10772.528,Maybe if we go--from the downtown tunnel into South Interbay?,222,,
1606,0.97,10772.528,10779.602,Not the Ballard tunnel into Interbay?,222,,
1607,0.97,10779.602,10779.935,Correct.,223,,
1608,0.97,10779.935,10781.704,From downtown tunnel into South Interbay.,223,,
1609,0.97,10781.704,10793.415,Sib 1 alternative from Deis to Gaylord.,224,,
1610,0.97,10793.415,10794.95,The tunnel portal is at Republican Treet.,224,,
1611,0.97,10794.95,10796.051,If you go back a few slides.,224,,
1612,0.97,10796.051,10799.789,There could be . that last one.,224,,
1613,0.97,10799.789,10813.068,I think it might--actually could we go back a few slides?,224,,
1614,0.97,10813.068,10814.937,I think we have something where the Potter location is.,224,,
1615,0.97,10814.937,10818.741,I would be certainly happy to will follow and provide greater clarification.,224,,
1616,0.97,10818.741,10824.747,I will provide a map that shows it more clearly.,224,,
1617,0.97,10824.747,10827.816,"But as you can see, Republican option.",224,,
1618,0.97,10827.816,10830.019,That is the pink option down below.,224,,
1619,0.97,10830.019,10835.391,That continues West . and would come out to a tunnel portal.,224,,
1620,0.97,10835.391,10838.861,It is somewhere where the gray line is.,224,,
1621,0.97,10838.861,10843.966,I do not have exactly where that tunnel portal is.,224,,
1622,0.97,10843.966,10846.635,Where is the Mercer station.,224,,
1623,0.97,10846.635,10849.538,It goes into the steep slope.,224,,
1624,0.97,10849.538,10858.147,And it comes out at the tunnel portal closer to this is one that is not noted on the slide.,224,,
1625,0.97,10858.147,10861.617,But also in our comments.,224,,
1626,0.97,10861.617,10873.429,In order to go from the Seattle center Mercer station.,224,,
1627,0.97,10875.197,10876.332,To the Elliott snake alignment.,224,,
1628,0.97,10876.332,10879.068,There would be a mix and match and refinement that would be required.,224,,
1629,0.97,10879.068,10880.836,We would be moving from Mercer into that Republican portal.,224,,
1630,0.97,10880.836,10882.671,It would come out at Republican street.,224,,
1631,0.97,10882.671,10885.574,"Sarah, I have the map.",225,,
1632,0.97,10885.574,10887.843,If you would like me to put it on the screen?,225,,
1633,0.97,10887.843,10888.244,Yes.,226,,
1634,0.97,10888.244,10889.612,That would be great.,226,,
1635,0.97,10889.612,10892.514,Thank you.,226,,
1636,0.97,10892.514,10896.452,There we go.,226,,
1637,0.97,10896.452,10896.886,Republican portal.,226,,
1638,0.97,10896.886,10900.356,"On the far left, lower corner.",226,,
1639,0.97,10900.356,10907.696,It is coming out at Republica to fit.,226,,
1640,0.97,10907.696,10908.964,Moving into an elevated Guideway.,226,,
1641,0.97,10908.964,10909.498,All along Elliott way.,226,,
1642,0.97,10909.498,10913.002,That is the Elliott snake portion.,226,,
1643,0.97,10913.002,10914.436,Continues as an elevated structure to Gaylord.,226,,
1644,0.97,10914.436,10915.804,And goes to Interbay.,226,,
1645,0.97,10915.804,10917.106,Whereas underneath that.,226,,
1646,0.97,10917.106,10918.14,You cannot see it.,226,,
1647,0.97,10918.14,10924.346,But it is the Sib 2 that also comes back through Republican portal.,226,,
1648,0.97,10924.346,10928.417,And would actually have a station at prospect street.,226,,
1649,0.97,10928.417,10934.323,And continue to central Interbay towards 15.,226,,
1650,0.97,10934.323,10938.661,I appreciate getting to see this diagram again.,227,,
1651,0.97,10938.661,10943.499,But it gets to one question I had.,227,,
1652,0.97,10943.499,10953.876,Does our endorsement of the Mercer alignment.,227,,
1653,0.97,10953.876,10964.753,Inherently mean a lot of the issues would be Elliott snake would be avoided anyway because it is a tunnel until West prospect.,227,,
1654,0.97,10964.753,10969.158,The snake is from West prospect back down Elliott way.,227,,
1655,0.97,10969.158,10975.965,It is . But let me pull the language up.,228,,
1656,0.97,10975.965,10981.904,But it is not explicit in a resolution?,228,,
1657,0.97,10981.904,10983.339,Perhaps we can call for it.,228,,
1658,0.97,10983.339,10985.874,The compatibility with the Seattle sent a is a high priority.,228,,
1659,0.97,10985.874,10988.077,In this recommendation.,228,,
1660,0.97,10988.077,10992.981,We would look to clarify that language if it is not there.,228,,
1661,0.97,10992.981,11001.023,This is not meant to preclude getting to that Gaylord Street station.,228,,
1662,0.97,11001.023,11005.094,What would the implications be of the tunnel?,229,,
1663,0.97,11005.094,11007.796,That comes out at prospect.,229,,
1664,0.97,11007.796,11014.303,For the businesses that are between West prospect on Elliott.,229,,
1665,0.97,11014.303,11023.679,Would there be less acquisition from Sdot?,229,,
1666,0.97,11023.679,11025.247,The main issue with that alternative.,230,,
1667,0.97,11025.247,11026.949,At that portal.,230,,
1668,0.97,11026.949,11027.75,Noted at prospect street.,230,,
1669,0.97,11027.75,11039.094,That comes out at a location that is a very landslide prone steep . that is the biggest concern that the city team has had.,230,,
1670,0.97,11039.094,11044.366,We have had to have that alternative moving forward.,230,,
1671,0.97,11044.366,11047.002,The difficulty in achieving complete slope stabilization.,230,,
1672,0.97,11047.002,11057.346,Furthermore to cite a light rail facility in an environmental critical area is against city policy.,230,,
1673,0.97,11057.346,11069.525,He would have a designation of essential public's facility.,230,,
1674,0.97,11069.892,11072.728,We would have to work so close with the sound Department of transportation.,230,,
1675,0.97,11072.728,11074.129,And really underscore from a Geotech standpoint.,230,,
1676,0.97,11074.129,11075.397,The challenges associated with this slope.,230,,
1677,0.97,11075.397,11081.737,In the city team has a very real concerns about the slope stabilization.,230,,
1678,0.97,11081.737,11084.339,Thank you for putting those concerns on the record.,231,,
1679,0.97,11084.339,11086.642,Thank you.,231,,
1680,0.97,11086.642,11089.678,Councilmembers I really appreciate your endurance for this meeting.,232,,
1681,0.97,11089.678,11091.98,In the thoroughness of the presentation.,232,,
1682,0.97,11091.98,11093.982,On this resolution.,232,,
1683,0.97,11093.982,11103.025,"And Marshall, Sarah do you want to go to the next slide?",232,,
1684,0.97,11103.025,11108.53,We just have a handful remaining.,233,,
1685,0.97,11108.53,11110.165,We will fly through a couple quickly.,233,,
1686,0.97,11110.165,11115.471,And I want to go to the next slide.,233,,
1687,0.97,11115.471,11117.139,And while it is Sdot represented at the table.,233,,
1688,0.97,11117.139,11119.575,I want to underscore this is a team environment.,233,,
1689,0.97,11119.575,11126.381,"Geotech implications, this is Sdot and certainly all of our partners in the neighborhoods.",233,,
1690,0.97,11126.381,11128.25,"With community development, Seattle center and throughout the city.",233,,
1691,0.97,11128.25,11137.659,The next steps . As sound transit presented in April.,233,,
1692,0.97,11137.659,11138.56,They are exploring Refinemnt concepts.,233,,
1693,0.97,11138.56,11139.461,Including cost savings concepts.,233,,
1694,0.97,11139.461,11150.038,This is a response to the 2021 St3 realignment exercise.,233,,
1695,0.97,11150.038,11152.541,Kick acknowledge the increasing cost estimates for the entirety of the system.,233,,
1696,0.97,11152.541,11156.178,Some of the alternatives and refinements . These are being put on the table are very drastic.,233,,
1697,0.97,11156.178,11158.68,And they would have very real implications for Ridership.,233,,
1698,0.97,11158.68,11165.42,And even agency and value.,233,,
1699,0.97,11165.42,11166.221,As a sitting position.,233,,
1700,0.97,11166.221,11167.456,We have discourage scope reduction.,233,,
1701,0.97,11167.456,11174.796,Any refinements would have not have a benefit to the riders.,233,,
1702,0.97,11174.796,11180.335,Or not consistent was committed in the action plan in 2016.,233,,
1703,0.97,11180.335,11191.213,We do support strategies . So here you have a couple of strategies that have put forward by sound transit.,233,,
1704,0.97,11191.213,11201.323,Including a consolidation of Demi- . This is two say strength Accessing the fastest growing nature and neighborhood in the entire region.,233,,
1705,0.97,11201.323,11203.125,This would be a significant change in Ridership.,233,,
1706,0.97,11203.125,11209.031,With what was promised to the voters.,233,,
1707,0.97,11209.031,11224.279,Also proposed alignments that would have station Entrances that would lead to better pedestrian access pick we are very interested in committing to working with sound transit to work with that.,233,,
1708,0.97,11224.279,11234.156,Next slide in addition sound transit has additional concepts that would provide additional benefits.,233,,
1709,0.97,11234.156,11236.258,For reduced risk for other concerns to the system.,233,,
1710,0.97,11236.258,11252.941,This includes in the city has been supportive including exploring the mix and match refinements that we have discussed throughout this presentation.,233,,
1711,0.97,11252.941,11253.742,Will provide greater flexibility.,233,,
1712,0.97,11253.742,11254.176,Across the system.,233,,
1713,0.97,11254.176,11254.91,Refinements to stations.,233,,
1714,0.97,11254.91,11256.178,Improve safety for Nonmotorized access.,233,,
1715,0.97,11256.178,11257.179,Providing better access with Hanover street.,233,,
1716,0.97,11257.179,11261.683,And if that looks from Belridge.,233,,
1717,0.97,11261.683,11269.858,Also avoid and mitigate adverse project impacts.,233,,
1718,0.97,11269.858,11273.562,Let me close out about -Party funding.,233,,
1719,0.97,11273.562,11281.803,Sound transit has recommended that there be the identification of party funds.,233,,
1720,0.97,11281.803,11282.437,"Additional, Non-Transit funds.",233,,
1721,0.97,11282.437,11295.083,For any to supplement the core funding of the established as part of the ballot measure.,233,,
1722,0.97,11296.385,11297.853,"Potential, -Party funding have decreased, significantly.",233,,
1723,0.97,11297.853,11298.787,Since that board action in 2019.,233,,
1724,0.97,11298.787,11300.622,That is based on additional refined and cost estimating's.,233,,
1725,0.97,11300.622,11301.156,Particular noting.,233,,
1726,0.97,11301.156,11303.091,The Delta elevated option and the tunnel options.,233,,
1727,0.97,11303.091,11308.563,West Seattle at Ballard have us decreasing significantly.,233,,
1728,0.97,11308.563,11309.865,We help identify opportunities for -Party funding.,233,,
1729,0.97,11309.865,11321.309,To support that work . and also exploring other strategies to control costs.,233,,
1730,0.97,11321.309,11322.778,Such as scheduled benefits and streamlining.,233,,
1731,0.97,11322.778,11323.979,The city anticipates more informal commitments.,233,,
1732,0.97,11323.979,11330.085,"For the Federal record of decision in 2013. and 2023, 2024.",233,,
