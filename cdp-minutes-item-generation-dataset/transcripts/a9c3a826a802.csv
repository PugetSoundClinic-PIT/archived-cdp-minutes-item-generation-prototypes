48,0.97,203.903,206.706,Thank you for the opportunity to speak.,10,,
49,0.97,206.706,213.212,My name is Theresa Clark.,10,,
50,0.97,213.212,220.52,I am the deputy director of the Washington low income housing alliance and I am speaking today in support of Council bill 120118.,10,,
51,0.97,220.52,234.234,We support this legislation and think it is necessary because it is critical to further the cities work--investments in these services need to be reliable and predictable.,10,,
52,0.97,234.234,241.441,Providers need to be able to depend on the funds and know that they will not be pulled out from under their feet.,10,,
53,0.97,241.441,256.689,And we know that reductions are extremely disruptive and damaging and can drive inefficiencies that set us back in our efforts to prevent and end homelessness.,10,,
54,0.97,256.689,261.561,"Additionally, Jumpstart is an intervention that addresses staggering income inequality in Seattle and in our region.",10,,
55,0.97,261.561,268.267,Income inequality is one of the biggest drivers of housing insecurity and homelessness.,10,,
56,0.97,268.267,277.777,Those earning less face out of reach housing costs and we know many Seattle Renters are facing a stark reality right now.,10,,
57,0.97,277.777,285.551,As they dig themselves out of pandemic related debt.,10,,
58,0.97,285.551,289.188,So many will need safety net services and affordable housing funded by Jumpstart in order to move forward.,10,,
59,0.97,289.188,295.094,"So, Seattle needs to stay the course on investments in these programs.",10,,
60,0.97,295.094,299.766,"So we urge support, thank you.",10,,
61,0.97,299.766,301.901,"Excellent, thank you very much, Theresa.",11,,
62,0.97,301.901,309.709,"And we have, also with us, Tammy--good morning.",11,,
63,0.97,309.709,317.817,"Good morning, thank you for the opportunity.",12,,
64,0.97,317.817,321.087,"My name is Tammy Hedrick, president and Ceo for the Washington food industry Association.",12,,
65,0.97,321.087,328.194,"I represent independent grocers, convenience stores, and suppliers in the city of Seattle.",12,,
66,0.97,328.194,332.899,I am here to address CB 120119.,12,,
67,0.97,332.899,340.239,My concerns are with the extended duration of the hazard pay that is focused on one industry.,12,,
68,0.97,340.239,347.88,This has been an extreme hardship for my independent grocers and I want to express my frustration with this arbitrary mandate on one industry.,12,,
69,0.97,347.88,351.751,"First and foremost, these are not Minimum-Wage jobs.",12,,
70,0.97,351.751,352.351,They have not been.,12,,
71,0.97,352.351,356.856,"Second, a Brookings study indicated the top 12 retailers had record profits.",12,,
72,0.97,356.856,372.538,"The first 10 were not included in this mandate, nor were they grocery stores and definitely not independent grocers.",12,,
73,0.97,372.538,618.818,We for affordable family rental housing and community uses.,12,,
74,0.97,618.818,625.024,I should say first and foremost that the vision for this investment comes from community.,12,,
75,0.97,625.024,634.533,Community was driving displacement in the neighborhood and really advocated and sought to achieve more affordable housing in the community.,12,,
76,0.97,634.533,652.551,I should also say this vision was supported strongly by the Mayor and the mission to jointly address affordable housing and to advance climate resilience is a shared goal across departments.,12,,
77,0.97,652.551,653.753,"I know, also, by many of you.",12,,
78,0.97,653.753,655.621,"Next slide, please, Jessica.",12,,
79,0.97,655.621,672.104,"As Councilmember Mosqueda mentioned, this is the first time we are taking action on a new Piec of authority given to the office of housing to allow direct acquisition of land that is then used as affordable housing.",12,,
80,0.97,672.104,693.225,"Typically what we do is support acquisitions generated from community organizations that come to us and seek investment, but in this case we are taking action to acquire property directly asked the city, place it into our care and then use processes and community outreach to ensure that it moves into affordable housing development.",12,,
81,0.97,693.225,701.5,This effort is really consistent with broader planning around the Duwamish Valley action plan.,12,,
82,0.97,701.5,715.314,We will hear more around that and how this is our effort to respond to the Anti- displacement goals set out in that action plan and also to demonstrate the city's ability to make aligned investments that achieve multiple public policy benefits.,12,,
83,0.97,715.314,741.107,"As I mentioned, this is a community driven vision and it has been driven by South Park community organizations, specifically the Duwamish Valley housing coalition and the Duwamish River cleanup coalition, who has also been involved in this effort.",12,,
84,0.97,741.107,744.543,I will turn it over to Jessica to talk about some of the particulars of this acquisition.,12,,
85,0.97,744.543,749.849,"Great, thank you so much, Emily.",13,,
86,0.97,749.849,751.417,Thank you so much for having me today.,13,,
87,0.97,751.417,758.09,"I will go through a couple of the details and as Emily mentioned, this is about the authorization to purchase two parcels in the heart of South park.",13,,
88,0.97,758.09,760.092,The combined price is $6.3 million.,13,,
89,0.97,760.092,766.465,"The combined sizes approximately 18,000S square feet.",13,,
90,0.97,766.465,773.172,"On this slide, this map shows that the parcels are adjacent to each other.",13,,
91,0.97,773.172,783.382,"Currently there are two commercial tenants, one residential occupant on the parcels, all of which are projected to continue occupancy when the city takes ownership.",13,,
92,0.97,783.382,784.216,The vision for development.,13,,
93,0.97,784.216,789.655,I would like to take a quick data point from the action plan.,13,,
94,0.97,789.655,798.197,"The median household income in 2018 was a little over $34,000.",13,,
95,0.97,798.197,802.468,55% of South Park residents are Renters and almost 55% of those are rent burdened.,13,,
96,0.97,802.468,811.01,The acquisition and development of a mixed use building would create a positive impact on South park.,13,,
97,0.97,811.01,819.118,"This building would provide safe, healthy, and affordable housing.",13,,
98,0.97,819.118,825.724,"To households that have been displaced or are at risk of displacement, including providing space on the ground floor in the heart of the community.",13,,
99,0.97,825.724,834.533,"It would create equitable access to the Duwamish River, newly developed green spaces and other community amenities, along with activating the 14th Avenue corridor.",13,,
100,0.97,834.533,851.016,We project this development would have multiple units in the community has advocated for a long time.,13,,
101,0.97,851.016,860.359,"Community preference will be utilized, which is really exciting, with strong community partnerships with local organizations, like the Duwamish Valley affordable housing coalition and the river cleanup coalition.",13,,
102,0.97,860.359,861.961,This project will target those most impacted.,13,,
103,0.97,861.961,871.07,"We want to share gratitude with all the work the community has done and are excited to continue collaborating, sending you all a big, virtual hug.",13,,
104,0.97,871.07,877.643,This project is significant and meets the racial equity outcomes outlined in the Duwamish Valley action plan.,13,,
105,0.97,877.643,883.883,I will hand it over to my colleague to give this project context within the larger frame of the program.,13,,
106,0.97,883.883,884.783,Thank you all.,13,,
107,0.97,884.783,887.753,"Thank you so much, Jessica.",14,,
108,0.97,887.753,889.188,I will try to keep it brief.,14,,
109,0.97,889.188,894.326,My name is Alberto Rodriguez and I am the advisor and Co- lead of the Duwamish Valley program.,14,,
110,0.97,894.326,899.098,I will give quick context for this work.,14,,
111,0.97,899.098,903.602,"Since 2016, the city has come together to advance justice and equitable development.",14,,
112,0.97,903.602,920.886,"This is an effort supported by 16 other city departments, such as our beautiful and amazing colleagues at 08.",14,,
113,0.97,920.886,925.924,We released an action plan that is a shared vision that will guide working investments in the Duwamish Valley for years to come.,14,,
114,0.97,925.924,944.41,"You know, priority areas include environment, parks, transportation public safety, and affordable housing, among other things and the work is aligned to six racial equity outcomes, which serve as what we want to achieve with everything we do in the Duwamish Valley, no matter how small or big an investment it is.",14,,
115,0.97,944.41,952.685,The action plan includes 15 actions we were able to implement from 2016 to Mid- 2018.,14,,
116,0.97,952.685,966.365,"37 projects, including approximately 140 actions that we hope to implement through 2022 and five long-term strategies that needed more work and additional partners to figure out.",14,,
117,0.97,966.365,977.543,The acquisition of these properties align with Anti- displacement goals and commitments we made as a city family in the action plan.,14,,
118,0.97,977.543,977.976,"Next slide, please.",14,,
119,0.97,977.976,988.921,This next slide will give you a quick visual on the diversity.,14,,
120,0.97,988.921,994.994,It highlights and gives you an idea of the Ecosystem of investments and diversity of working projects in the South Park neighborhood that we are doing as a city family.,14,,
121,0.97,994.994,1018.217,"As we continued implementing these projects related to trails or new parks and open spaces, River access, drainage and Conveyance, River cleanup, community members expressed concern at how we could be exacerbating existing pressures and asked us to make parallel investment in affordable housing, both in preservation and Acquisitin and development of new affordable housing.",14,,
122,0.97,1018.217,1024.69,"Thanks for partnership with and the leadership of the office of housing, we are on track to delivering the biggest community priority.",14,,
123,0.97,1024.69,1025.09,Next slide.,14,,
124,0.97,1025.09,1026.025,Thank you.,14,,
125,0.97,1026.025,1031.33,"This slide, very quickly, here are the five long-term strategies I mentioned.",14,,
126,0.97,1031.33,1056.555,"Today you are hearing about some of the work related to displacement, led by Oh, but in the next couple of weeks some of you will hear from some of our colleagues from Seattle parks and recreation on efforts related to parks and open space and in the next months, the Duwamish Valley team would like to come to some of you and share details on climate change adaptation, health, and long- term strategies.",14,,
127,0.97,1056.555,1065.264,Now I will give it back to director Emily Alvarado to share more details on the Timeline of the acquisition of the properties.,14,,
128,0.97,1065.264,1066.532,Thank you so much.,15,,
129,0.97,1066.532,1074.44,"So, a little bit of brass Tacks here, to make sure Councilmembers are aware of where we have been undergoing.",15,,
130,0.97,1074.44,1082.247,We have entered a purchase and sale agreement for these two parcels and that was initiated in March.,15,,
131,0.97,1082.247,1087.653,I do want to acknowledge the incredible work of our city attorney's office who has been helping us navigate this acquisition.,15,,
132,0.97,1087.653,1088.253,Thank you.,15,,
133,0.97,1088.253,1098.197,We have also completed a phase one and phase two environmental work.,15,,
134,0.97,1098.197,1111.61,"While there are some things revealed as part of that environmental work, given the neighborhood it is in, the community, these are to be expected and we believe they can be Ameliorated through investment and Predevelopment work.",15,,
135,0.97,1111.61,1116.081,"At this point the projected closing date is August 15, 2021.",15,,
136,0.97,1116.081,1125.224,What we need from you and what we are seeking and I will talk more on the next slide is authorization for this acquisition in order to close on project financing.,15,,
137,0.97,1125.224,1133.365,We need to come to Council per city charter in order to do that.,15,,
138,0.97,1133.365,1135.601,"Following that, there are other steps we will move forward on.",15,,
139,0.97,1135.601,1141.106,First of all we will continue to do community engagement in order to inform the design of the request for proposal we intend to develop.,15,,
140,0.97,1141.106,1144.009,That will be work with community.,15,,
141,0.97,1144.009,1158.957,"It might also include complementary work including working with an architectural firm to ensure the readiness of the project design, so that we can move more quickly.",15,,
142,0.97,1158.957,1166.665,"That might, for example, be something we can do in combination with the home and hope initiative and our contract through enterprise community partners.",15,,
143,0.97,1166.665,1170.669,Following that we create the Rfp and release that.,15,,
144,0.97,1170.669,1178.243,We expect that to be released next year and we will be using office of housing resources in order to invest in this Rfp.,15,,
145,0.97,1178.243,1208.307,"We also, as Jessica mentioned, intend for this to be a project really Shwcasing building level Sustainability goals and in order to achieve those really high levels of Sustainability goals, we will be seeking to build new partnerships across city departments and also with private investors and others to ensure that we can make this a building that is really Top- notch as it relates to affordable family housing and climate resilience.",15,,
146,0.97,1208.307,1209.508,We will be releasing that Rfp.,15,,
147,0.97,1209.508,1213.845,We will be doing our typical selection process to select a qualified developer and owner operator.,15,,
148,0.97,1213.845,1224.523,"Then as you know, per city charter also, we will return to Council prior to any property disposition and inform you of who has been selected and receive your feedback before we move forward.",15,,
149,0.97,1224.523,1228.594,"Next slide, please.",15,,
150,0.97,1228.594,1245.043,"So the legislative action here today is to approve the acquisition of the two parcels, which would give the office of housing, in combination with our attorneys, the opportunity to close on the purchase and sale agreement.",15,,
151,0.97,1245.043,1262.527,"Close on the transaction and move forward and bring these properties into office of housing jurisdiction, where we will serve as a caretaker of these properties in order to then go through the community process to ensure that they are developed into affordable housing.",15,,
152,0.97,1262.527,1273.271,"This satisfies, as I mentioned earlier, the requirements set out in the city charter which requires city Council to take action prior to any acceptance of property.",15,,
153,0.97,1273.271,1274.773,And I think that concludes our presentation.,15,,
154,0.97,1274.773,1282.047,I will stop there and if there are any questions?,15,,
155,0.97,1282.047,1282.447,Thank you.,16,,
156,0.97,1282.447,1286.084,"Councilmember Herbold, please go ahead.",16,,
157,0.97,1286.084,1287.286,Thank you so much.,17,,
158,0.97,1287.286,1288.887,I am also very excited about the project.,17,,
159,0.97,1288.887,1306.805,"This is really a long time coming and I think it just really is fantastic that the office of housing is using, is piloting, really, this different approach for South park.",17,,
160,0.97,1306.805,1339.538,"They often say in South Park, because it is a small community, that if you really want to figure out how to address displacement, it is an issue that you can actually--that the community believes they could do a list of people who are at risk of displacement and develop a strategy around helping those, that list of people maintain housing.",17,,
161,0.97,1339.538,1352.851,"I think a project like this has the capacity to serve that function of housing people in that community, who the community knows is at risk of displacement.",17,,
162,0.97,1352.851,1355.454,So this is just really exciting.,17,,
163,0.97,1355.454,1365.864,"A lot of credit to everybody at Duwamish Valley affordable housing coalition, who, for years, has been developing this vision.",17,,
164,0.97,1365.864,1374.973,A special shout out to Maria Ramirez as well as other folks who have been doing this work.,17,,
165,0.97,1374.973,1381.98,"Not just in South Park, but Georgetown and communities of the Duwamish valley.",17,,
166,0.97,1381.98,1389.087,I really appreciate the emphasis on engagement and development of the Rfp.,17,,
167,0.97,1389.087,1401.8,And I know there is a lot of energy in South Park for Partnering with the city in the next steps of this vision.,17,,
168,0.97,1401.8,1428.293,"Because of the concern and real experiences that South Park has with displacement, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the office of housing's approach around community preference and implementation of goals associated with addressing displacement?",17,,
169,0.97,1428.293,1428.927,"Yeah, absolutely.",18,,
170,0.97,1428.927,1449.614,"So I think first of all this is one opportunity to help address displacement in the neighborhood, but it is neither the only thing we think is necessary, nor is it the only thing the office of housing has worked on.",18,,
171,0.97,1449.614,1466.665,"The action plan, in fact, lays out a series of investments and strategies, some of which we have already been engaged in, including the healthy homes initiative, where we sought to work with homeowners and Renters of single-family homes to ensure they had access to tools that improve indoor air quality and make sure people can live healthy, in their home.",18,,
172,0.97,1466.665,1467.465,There are other investments.,18,,
173,0.97,1467.465,1482.08,This will not be sufficient in and of itself and we are committed to continuing other strategies and learning more from the community of what those strategies could be.,18,,
174,0.97,1482.08,1497.662,"We also, for example, another action is we are Partnering, as part of our rental assistance program, to be one of the Community-Based organizations delivering rent assistance in the neighborhood, because we know the localized rent assistance pathways will be critical to preventing displacement.",18,,
175,0.97,1497.662,1502.033,"For this project, we seek to implement community preference.",18,,
176,0.97,1502.033,1507.739,"Community preference has been used several times already in our neighborhood, in our city, in our investments.",18,,
177,0.97,1507.739,1522.02,What we know is that allows for up to 50% of the units to be Prioritized for folks who have experienced displacement or have Long-Standing roots in the community.,18,,
178,0.97,1522.02,1534.065,"Typically what happens with community preferences the policy is not dictated by the office, but we work with the owner operator of the housing to define it in a way that will maximize those outcomes for the neighborhood.",18,,
179,0.97,1534.065,1555.053,"So we will continue to do that in partnership and support them and it does allow, Councilmember Herbold, for folks, for really affirmative marketing and outreach to folks who have been impacted, to get information first, so that they have the best opportunity to apply for housing if that is what they choose.",18,,
180,0.97,1555.053,1573.071,"It is also something we are doing with our affordable homeownership investment in South Park, which we did in partnership with habitat for humanity and they are using community preference in a √ödifferent way in partnership with Community-Based organizations to find homebuyers.",18,,
181,0.97,1573.071,1574.739,A quick follow-up.,19,,
182,0.97,1574.739,1592.59,"Does that mean the community preference, the expectation √öthat the provider will use community preference, does that mean that will be embedded in the Rfp itself?",19,,
183,0.97,1592.59,1594.259,"Yeah, we can expect to do that.",20,,
184,0.97,1594.259,1599.597,It is set out as a community vision and would anticipate that it would be placed inside the Rfp.,20,,
185,0.97,1599.597,1603.602,Thank you.,21,,
186,0.97,1603.602,1605.003,"Wonderful, thank you very much.",22,,
187,0.97,1605.003,1608.306,Are there any additional questions on this item?,22,,
188,0.97,1608.306,1609.407,Any additional questions?,22,,
189,0.97,1609.407,1616.581,Okay.,22,,
190,0.97,1616.581,1617.816,"I had my hand raised, sorry.",23,,
191,0.97,1617.816,1618.616,Please go ahead.,24,,
192,0.97,1618.616,1621.619,I will turn on the chat function so I can see it.,24,,
193,0.97,1621.619,1622.887,Thank you.,24,,
194,0.97,1622.887,1623.488,That's okay.,25,,
195,0.97,1623.488,1624.089,Sorry about that.,25,,
196,0.97,1624.089,1630.195,I also want to say thank you to the office of housing and sustainable development for the work on this.,25,,
197,0.97,1630.195,1635.634,I actually wanted to dig in a little bit more about some of these environmental concerns that Emily sort of mentioned in passing.,25,,
198,0.97,1635.634,1647.445,"We know with the air quality and water quality situation in the Duwamish Valley, in particular the South Park neighborhood.",25,,
199,0.97,1647.445,1649.447,I am a resident of the South Park neighborhood myself.,25,,
200,0.97,1649.447,1657.856,"I am all too familiar with the realities and consequences of, you know, climate change and the impact on those communities.",25,,
201,0.97,1657.856,1682.981,"So I wanted to get a sense of what the environmental concerns are and how they will be addressed in project development and in particular I would like an understanding of how the city might be able to leverage this project to really model some green building, green Stormwater infrastructure, that can really help to promote a healthier community for South park.",25,,
202,0.97,1682.981,1688.086,"Thank you, Council President, for those questions.",26,,
203,0.97,1688.086,1689.087,There are two pieces to answer.,26,,
204,0.97,1689.087,1704.702,"One is the environmental conditions of the site and then, too, ensuring that development advances resilience and also make sure it is built at a standard that is protecting residence.",26,,
205,0.97,1704.702,1711.242,"So first, Jessica, do you want to talk about the outcomes of the environmental work done to date?",26,,
206,0.97,1711.242,1711.609,Sure.,27,,
207,0.97,1711.609,1719.317,"As Emily mentioned earlier, I'm not sure if you got this, but there was a phase one done and a phase two.",27,,
208,0.97,1719.317,1727.892,"Nothing major, no major red flags came out of that, except for some contamination on the gravel site of the tow truck company, which is the 8914 site, right on the corner.",27,,
209,0.97,1727.892,1737.235,"That seems to be typical, par for the course type of cleanup that we anticipate to have on the site.",27,,
210,0.97,1737.235,1747.579,"No external seepage coming in from the adjacent sites, so Groundwater was not impacted by any other chemicals coming in from any other site or from this site, specifically.",27,,
211,0.97,1747.579,1758.156,"Then the sea level rise, the map of the sea level rise that is Impacting South park and the Duwamish Valley does not cover this site.",27,,
212,0.97,1758.156,1770.368,So we are not anticipating that type of risk.,27,,
213,0.97,1770.368,1779.677,"On the building level, you know, we are in the conversation phase here, but we have had really good conversations with Osc.",28,,
214,0.97,1779.677,1791.089,"I have had great discussions about how we cannot only showcase great infrastructure technology, but really look at water retention and water management systems, as well, at the building.",28,,
215,0.97,1791.089,1792.29,"Full transparency, those things have costs.",28,,
216,0.97,1792.29,1808.64,"We think they are worthwhile costs, but as the office of housing, we will be seeking to begin partnerships to ensure we can put those, showcase, really important Technologies in place.",28,,
217,0.97,1808.64,1824.823,"I will also say that the level of building standards that we do already is to be built to Evergreen standards and through those we have, in many other parts of the city, used features that mitigate any issues around air pollution and noise.",28,,
218,0.97,1824.823,1835.934,"For example, we have developments near highways that have worked really hard to ensure high quality, internal systems are in place to keep people safe and healthy.",28,,
219,0.97,1835.934,1842.407,"Thank you for that, Emily and Jessica.",29,,
220,0.97,1842.407,1849.314,I am looking forward to learning more about and tracking some of those opportunities to identify ways to partner with others.,29,,
221,0.97,1849.314,1889.587,"I realize that there are costs to moving in this direction, but the cost is pennies on the dollar in comparison to the gravity of climate change that we are all facing, so I think anything we can do on the Council to be supportive of creating or identifying partnerships or building those bridges or identifying additional revenue sources to achieve that ultimate, shared goal, you know, sort of I stand at the ready to be a partner with you all on that effort, so looking forward to learning more about those details.",29,,
222,0.97,1889.587,1893.191,I think this is a really exciting opportunity.,29,,
223,0.97,1893.191,1910.909,"We have been hearing from South Park residents for years about the need to aggressively tackle Anti-Displacement and this is a small step in the right direction and I look forward to seeing it have great success, to see how we can bring this really innovative model to scale across the city.",29,,
224,0.97,1910.909,1915.179,So thanks to all of you for your really important work.,29,,
225,0.97,1915.179,1922.22,Any additional comments?,30,,
226,0.97,1922.22,1923.488,"Okay, I am not seeing any.",30,,
227,0.97,1923.488,1940.738,"I want to echo a few of the comments made by my colleagues this morning, thanking the office of housing and office of Sustainability and the environment for your work on this effort and again, echoing what the Council President said, hoping to see more of this type of policy Replicated across the city.",30,,
228,0.97,1940.738,1963.127,"We know that the acquisition authority right now is ever important, given the high price of both land and property in the city, so we are really thankful that we are moving forward on this and also appreciate the work of the Council in partnership with the office of housing to remove the cap on the plan earlier this year.",30,,
229,0.97,1963.127,1967.899,That will be extremely important as we seek to recover from Covid and find additional opportunities around our community.,30,,
230,0.97,1967.899,1979.177,"We also know that this is being led by the community and this is an opportunity for us to follow the leadership of the community to create more affordable housing and community space, specifically in South park.",30,,
231,0.97,1979.177,1990.088,I'm really excited this acquisition authority is meeting with the community is asking for in this moment and I look forward to doing more of that with the release that we authorize.,30,,
232,0.97,1990.088,1996.461,I also appreciate the connection to addressing displacement that you talked about.,30,,
233,0.97,1996.461,2031.329,"I think there is a Misperception that when we talk about development it equals displacement and this is a great example of when we do development done right, when we listen to the community and follow their lead, we can address displacement by Embedding into these policy strategies that Councilmember Herbold discussed this morning that we are excited to expand as well in the last four years, making sure we are using the community preference and strategies to make sure we are addressing displacement and that we simultaneously address the disproportionate environmental justice impacts on our community.",30,,
234,0.97,2031.329,2059.357,"And I think this is another reminder that when we build affordable housing within our city, it also helps to address the disproportionate communities at higher risk of displacement and higher risk of having to commute in and greater exposure to environmental toxins due to carbon emissions and the health consequences of sitting in cars for a long time.",30,,
235,0.97,2059.357,2066.464,So I really appreciate the work you have done today and did not want to Miss an opportunity to also talk about the need for us to move quickly on this legislation.,30,,
236,0.97,2066.464,2078.676,We do want to act relatively quickly to be in partnership with the community who has tight Timelines moving forward.,30,,
237,0.97,2078.676,2091.289,"The Office of housing has agreed with the seller to be able to move this forward to meet the desired Timeline and thanks to the Council President's office and their support for moving this forward relatively quickly, given that it is a Friday meeting.",30,,
238,0.97,2091.289,2107.905,"We would need to consider this sooner than the week long wait next week, so with your support today, colleagues, we will be voting on this legislation and after we vote on it we would need to suspend the rules.",30,,
239,0.97,2107.905,2110.374,"Thank you again, Council President, for your work on making that possible.",30,,
240,0.97,2110.374,2116.481,Anything else before we going to voting?,30,,
241,0.97,2116.481,2117.482,"Okay, I am not seeing any.",30,,
242,0.97,2117.482,2118.316,Let's move this forward.,30,,
243,0.97,2118.316,2120.251,"I want to thank the office of housing, ose.",30,,
244,0.97,2120.251,2126.824,Thank you for walking us through this.,30,,
245,0.97,2126.824,2133.531,"Councilmember Herbold, I know you have been working on this in your district for a long time, along with the Council President's interest in seeing these efforts move forward.",30,,
246,0.97,2133.531,2134.132,I am very excited.,30,,
247,0.97,2134.132,2141.639,"Councilmember Lewis, I did not want to leave you out, but we will make sure we get you counted in for your support.",30,,
248,0.97,2141.639,2149.146,Imove the committee recommend passage of bill 120114.,30,,
249,0.97,2149.146,2149.58,Second.,31,,

251,0.97,2155.253,2156.554,Is there any additional comments?,32,,
252,0.97,2156.554,2157.121,Thank you very much.,32,,
253,0.97,2157.121,2161.859,"Madame clerk, would you call the roll on the recommendation that the bill pass?",32,,
254,0.97,2161.859,2165.63,Herbold.,33,,
255,0.97,2165.63,2166.23,Yes.,34,,
256,0.97,2166.23,2171.335,1023.,35,,
257,0.97,2171.335,2171.736,Aye.,36,,
258,0.97,2171.736,2172.37,Councilmember Lewis.,37,,
259,0.97,2172.37,2174.238,Yes.,38,,
260,0.97,2174.238,2178.276,"Four in favor, none opposed.",39,,
261,0.97,2178.276,2182.079,"Thank you very much, it is unanimous.",40,,
262,0.97,2182.079,2210.508,"The recommendation that the bill, as passed, will be sent to the full Council and colleagues if there is no objection, the rule relating to referring legislation to a city council meeting when the committee meeting is after Thursday at noon will be suspended to allow for the referral of Council bill 120114 to this upcoming Monday, July 12 meeting for the city, Seattle city council consideration at full council.",40,,
263,0.97,2210.508,2215.58,Is there any objection?,40,,
264,0.97,2215.58,2220.885,"Hearing no objection, the rules are suspended in the bill will be referred to Monday, July 12.",40,,
265,0.97,2220.885,2222.82,Full Seattle city council meeting for final consideration.,40,,
266,0.97,2222.82,2226.857,Congratulations everyone and congratulations to the community in South park.,40,,
267,0.97,2226.857,2230.228,Wonderful.,40,,
268,0.97,2230.228,2230.828,"Thanks, all.",40,,
269,0.97,2230.828,2231.629,I appreciate your time.,40,,
270,0.97,2231.629,2233.431,Let's move on to item number two.,40,,
271,0.97,2233.431,2248.913,"Agenda item number two, council bill 120113, and ordinance relating to the multifamily housing property tax exemption program.",41,,
272,0.97,2248.913,2250.114,"For briefing, discussion, and possible vote.",41,,
273,0.97,2250.114,2253.551,Thank you very much and that is why we saw some of the tiles remain the same.,42,,
274,0.97,2253.551,2266.43,"This is a continuation of our housing conversation with director Alvarado, Traci Ratzliff from Council central staff and we are also joined by Jennifer Labrecque.",42,,
275,0.97,2266.43,2271.936,This legislation is also exciting.,42,,
276,0.97,2271.936,2279.043,"This is the Covid extension legislation that merrily relates to protections, excuse me, do projects with Timelines that have been impacted by the pandemic.",42,,
277,0.97,2279.043,2286.284,I'm going to turn it over to central staff for a technical Walk-Through and then I will add additional context as we consider the legislation.,42,,
278,0.97,2286.284,2294.191,"And Traci or Emily, I will turn it over to you.",42,,
279,0.97,2294.191,2305.836,"Just to let folks know, this legislation and another piece of legislation you will hear in August are in response to changes made at the state Legislature that gave us authority to do a couple of things.",43,,
280,0.97,2305.836,2310.274,"One, to deal with the impact on the construction industry of Covid.",43,,
281,0.97,2310.274,2316.681,There were delays in terms of projects moving forward for construction.,43,,
282,0.97,2316.681,2335.633,The first piece that we deal with today will address that issue and the one coming up in August will deal with the ability to actually extend projects that have expiring tax exemptions and to hopefully allow for the continuation of the tax exemption for those projects that will be expiring in the next couple of years.,43,,
283,0.97,2335.633,2340.538,All of these pieces of legislation response to authority we get from the state.,43,,
284,0.97,2340.538,2347.545,I will now let Emily and Jennifer walk through today's legislation.,43,,
285,0.97,2347.545,2358.456,Jennifer is our manager of policy and planning and oversees the implementation of the multifamily tax exemption program.,44,,
286,0.97,2358.456,2363.294,"I will let her Walk-Through, but really as Tracy mentioned, this is narrow legislation.",44,,
287,0.97,2363.294,2364.862,It is technical.,44,,
288,0.97,2364.862,2371.635,And it is really more tightly tied to Covid and it is time sensitive.,44,,
289,0.97,2371.635,2391.088,"As Traci mentioned, we are coming to Council with more legislation and this piece had time sensitivity, which, pushed for us to move more quickly on its introduction to you.",44,,
290,0.97,2391.088,2392.89,"Jen, I will turn it over to you.",44,,
291,0.97,2392.89,2398.596,"Great, thank you, I will share my screen now.",45,,
292,0.97,2398.596,2406.704,"Excuse me, I need to go back to the beginning.",45,,
293,0.97,2406.704,2411.008,"Thank you, as Emily mentioned my name is Jennifer Labrecque, the planning and programs manager for the office of housing.",45,,
294,0.97,2411.008,2423.621,"Good morning, Councilmembers, and thank you for having us here this morning to talk about the first piece of Mfte legislation you will be seeing this summer.",45,,
295,0.97,2423.621,2429.093,We will be back in August to discuss the second piece.,45,,
296,0.97,2429.093,2431.729,"A very brief overview, which I don't think anybody at this table needs.",45,,
297,0.97,2431.729,2446.61,It is an inventive program that provides a tax exemption for a percentage of units and is one of the city's largest tools for creating income and rent restricted housing.,45,,
298,0.97,2446.61,2453.451,We normally come to every three or four years when the program is up for renewal to talk about changes to the program.,45,,
299,0.97,2453.451,2454.251,We are here earlier.,45,,
300,0.97,2454.251,2459.757,The program was last updated in 2019 and up for renewal in 2023.,45,,
301,0.97,2459.757,2467.064,"We are here earlier, because changes were made at the state level during the 2021 legislative session that made some changes.",45,,
302,0.97,2467.064,2482.68,So there were changes made to the Rcw that authorizes the Mfte program and we are here to accommodate some of the time sensitive changes that were made.,45,,
303,0.97,2482.68,2487.184,We have a Bifurcated strategy to accommodate the changes that were made to the Rcw.,45,,
304,0.97,2487.184,2498.996,"We are here today to talk about the first piece of legislation that is needed on an expedited schedule to accommodate project needs, timing needs, projects delayed by Covid.",45,,
305,0.97,2498.996,2518.015,"We will be back in August to talk about accommodating other time sensitive and required changes including an extension option for projects that are expiring over the next couple of years, along with an accompanying resolution to address other issues, including things like labor equity.",45,,
306,0.97,2518.015,2524.521,So let's talk specifically about the ordinance that is before Council today.,45,,
307,0.97,2524.521,2530.828,"So, this ordinance provides additional time for some projects to complete.",45,,
308,0.97,2530.828,2540.804,"As a reminder, Mfte projects currently have five years from the time of application to receive a certificate of occupancy.",45,,
309,0.97,2540.804,2551.348,"That is a hard deadline so projects cannot receive additional time, as currently written.",45,,
310,0.97,2551.348,2553.751,"Because of Covid-19, the Rcw was changed.",45,,
311,0.97,2553.751,2561.859,"So, both the Rcw and the FCC used to have this five-year requirement.",45,,
312,0.97,2561.859,2572.236,"During the legislative session due to Covid-19, the Rcw was changed to allow an additional five years for some projects to complete.",45,,
313,0.97,2572.236,2575.739,"As a reminder, the Rcw authorizes the Mfte program.",45,,
314,0.97,2575.739,2591.789,In general it creates a framework and local jurisdictions have the discretion to set additional conditions if they so choose.,45,,
315,0.97,2591.789,2602.366,So the Rcw now allows projects an additional five years to complete and locally we want to implement that additional time in a narrow way.,45,,
316,0.97,2602.366,2615.212,"So, under the proposed ordinance, we have proposed that some projects can remain vested under older Mfte programs while receiving an additional five years to complete.",45,,
317,0.97,2615.212,2624.521,"I think the key here is that there is, of course, a Mfte program in existence right now, program six.",45,,
318,0.97,2624.521,2632.83,"Projects can always choose to apply under that program, should they choose to do so.",45,,
319,0.97,2632.83,2652.282,"These projects will be able to essentially remain vested under Lder versions of programs and those older versions have higher Affordability limits, because as you all know, Affordability limits have generally gone down over time as the program has been renewed.",45,,
320,0.97,2652.282,2659.857,So these projects can remain vested under older versions of the program with higher Affordability in the mix and will have an additional five years to complete.,45,,
321,0.97,2659.857,2669.633,"Has also previously mentioned, under this ordinance, the additional time to complete is narrowly structured.",45,,
322,0.97,2669.633,2671.568,Projects have to meet certain restrictions to get it.,45,,
323,0.97,2671.568,2675.739,They have to demonstrate that the project was delayed due to Covid.,45,,
324,0.97,2675.739,2686.65,"We have also set other timing provisions and those timing provisions are intended, again, to help ensure that these are projects who really were impacted by Covid.",45,,
325,0.97,2686.65,2698.195,"So the project had to have expired after Covid began, but before February, 2022.",45,,
326,0.97,2698.195,2704.134,That two years is really the time in which projects would be most likely to have actually been impacted by Covid and to be able to demonstrate that impact.,45,,
327,0.97,2704.134,2726.824,"Projects need to contact the office of housing by September 30 to request the additional five years, again, with the intent that if the project has been impacted by Covid, that it is reasonable that they would contact the office of housing this year to let us know that they need additional time to complete.",45,,
328,0.97,2726.824,2735.799,"Looking at our pipeline and the status of projects, we believe that most a handful of projects will take advantage of this additional five years.",45,,
329,0.97,2735.799,2739.436,And that is it.,45,,
330,0.97,2739.436,2740.737,Thank you very much.,46,,
331,0.97,2740.737,2745.142,"Colleagues, are there questions?",46,,
332,0.97,2745.142,2745.642,Councilmember Herbold.,46,,
333,0.97,2745.642,2749.146,Thanks.,47,,
334,0.97,2749.146,2765.062,"Trying to understand why, why we would not just ask the proponents of these projects to just apply under the current program?",47,,
335,0.97,2765.062,2770.934,It is a good question.,48,,
336,0.97,2770.934,2773.37,It is something that is a policy decision.,48,,
337,0.97,2773.37,2813.01,"What we hear from developers who are seeking this extension and advocated very strongly at the state for the extension, is that they are very far into the process of building a building and they have set up financing and other factors around the expectations that are already included in the initial contract from the first application and that it was actions that were produced as a result of government action, including a stoppage of construction work, that have changed the environment for their ability to fulfill that on the Timeline that was initially requested.",48,,
338,0.97,2813.01,2820.384,"I do not, have not, spent time inquiring into each project that we have heard from.",48,,
339,0.97,2820.384,2837.034,"How much their financing has changed or how much construction stoppage impacted, but it is reasonable to assume that what was happening during the pandemic has impacted these projects that were already well underway.",48,,
340,0.97,2837.034,2841.638,It is not that they just started thinking about how to build the building.,48,,
341,0.97,2841.638,2875.772,"And finally I would say that it is my understanding that during the last recession, there were steps taken to ensure that Mfte at that time also adapted to help protect or accommodate developments that were currently underway, in order to ensure that things were not harmed by the ability to use Mft, not harmed by what was happening in the discussion.",48,,
342,0.97,2875.772,2877.241,"Thank you, it is really helpful.",49,,
343,0.97,2877.241,2879.243,Thank you.,50,,
344,0.97,2879.243,2881.478,"That is the same question that I had, as well.",50,,
345,0.97,2881.478,2896.293,I think when it came down to the policy questions and there was sort of two Motivational factors for me wanting to support this legislation and being sympathetic to the need to move relatively quickly.,50,,
346,0.97,2896.293,2903.4,One was that it FALLS in alignment with what the state has put as a possibility to expedite these projects.,50,,
347,0.97,2903.4,2906.603,Projects that have been impacted.,50,,
348,0.97,2906.603,2920.017,"We know it will be narrow and we also, I think, want to make sure we are not creating additional barriers for building the housing that we so desperately need, post pandemic, given the cost of labor and materials right now.",50,,
349,0.97,2920.017,2932.229,"It felt like an additional tool in the tool belt to expedite the creation of housing, recognizing a much longer conversation is to come around Mfte changes in the upcoming fall.",50,,
350,0.97,2932.229,2939.336,Any additional comments?,51,,
351,0.97,2939.336,2940.938,"Okay, again, I appreciate the Walk-Through, Jennifer.",51,,
352,0.97,2940.938,2947.044,Thank you for being here today.,51,,
353,0.97,2947.044,2968.765,"Recognizing that this follows the state legislative changes, the narrow focus on projects that have only been impacted by Covid and that there will be ongoing conversations later this summer and fall about Mfte changes that the state Legislature has also authorized to make programmatic updates, including consideration for authorizing extensions for units that are expiring in the next couple of years.",51,,
354,0.97,2968.765,2981.378,"It will be a really interesting opportunity for us to figure out Ho this tool in the tool belt helps yield additional housing, specific to the legislation today and the handful of projects impacted by Covid.",51,,
355,0.97,2981.378,2994.191,I am comfortable moving forward with this legislation and hope that this helps finalize the creation of those specific projects and we look forward to additional conversations to come soon.,51,,
356,0.97,2994.191,2999.262,"Traci, is there additional context would like to add?",51,,
357,0.97,2999.262,3002.132,"I am seeing a Headshaking no, for folks in the Online audience watching.",51,,
358,0.97,3002.132,3009.272,I am not seeing any additional comments.,51,,
359,0.97,3009.272,3013.71,"Colleagues, I moved the committee recommend passage of Council bill 120113.",51,,
360,0.97,3013.71,3014.511,Is there a second?,51,,
361,0.97,3014.511,3016.913,Has been moved and Seconded.,52,,
362,0.97,3016.913,3021.618,Are there any additional comments or questions?,52,,
363,0.97,3021.618,3027.724,"Hearing none, will the clerk call the roll on the recommendation that the bill pass?",52,,
364,0.97,3027.724,3028.125,Madam chair?,53,,
365,0.97,3028.125,3028.525,Aye.,54,,
366,0.97,3028.525,3034.431,Vice chair Herbold.,55,,
367,0.97,3034.431,3034.831,Yes.,56,,
368,0.97,3034.831,3035.432,President Gonzalez.,57,,
369,0.97,3035.432,3035.832,Yes.,58,,

371,0.97,3037.234,3037.634,Aye.,60,,
372,0.97,3037.634,3042.039,"That is far in favor, none opposed.",61,,
373,0.97,3042.039,3046.243,It is unanimous and the motion carries.,61,,
374,0.97,3046.243,3052.849,"The bill will be sent to the July 19, 2021 Seattle city council fall meeting for final consideration.",61,,
375,0.97,3052.849,3057.554,Thank you again office of housing friends and Traci for all the work on this.,61,,
376,0.97,3057.554,3061.558,I also want to thank Aaron house for her work today.,61,,
377,0.97,3061.558,3076.039,"I appreciate her being back in our office and all the work she has done to get up to speed on these important bills, as well as the larger pieces of legislation that we will be discussing later.",61,,
378,0.97,3076.039,3076.44,"Thanks, all.",61,,
379,0.97,3076.44,3078.875,"Thanks for your work on this and good to see you, Jennifer.",61,,
380,0.97,3078.875,3084.381,"Okay, let's move on to item three on our agenda, moving right along.",61,,
381,0.97,3084.381,3094.758,"Agenda item number three, council bill 120119, and ordinance relating to employment in Seattle for briefing and discussion.",62,,
382,0.97,3094.758,3096.159,"Wonderful, thank you very much.",63,,
383,0.97,3096.159,3101.198,"I see our friend Karina bull, who is a lead on labor policy.",63,,
384,0.97,3101.198,3107.771,"I also see Aly Pennucci with us for a later piece of legislation, but welcome to our central staff team.",63,,
385,0.97,3107.771,3117.28,"Colleagues, this is a follow-up to a conversation we started in our last committee meeting but is really a conversation we began earlier this year.",63,,
386,0.97,3117.28,3123.386,I want to offer a few remarks for background as we head into the discussion about the specific bill.,63,,
387,0.97,3123.386,3137.4,"You remember at the beginning of this year we passed emergency legislation on hazard pay for grocery workers, requiring grocery stores to pay employees an additional four dollars per hour to compensate them for the risk to their health and the health and safety of their families.",63,,
388,0.97,3137.4,3148.311,"This is something that many cities considered up and down the West Coast and I am proud of Seattle, proud of the city Council and the Mayor, for being the first in Washington State to pass hazard pay legislation for grocery store workers.",63,,
389,0.97,3148.311,3154.851,We saw this taken up by a number of cities in the region as well after the passage by the city.,63,,
390,0.97,3154.851,3174.571,"We did this because we saw at the beginning of the pandemic that many industries reduced hours, reduced exposure, and were allowing folks to work from home, but this was not the case for essential workers, especially those in the grocery store, who help to keep families Fed and safe and had no choice but to report to work.",63,,
391,0.97,3174.571,3183.28,We heard story after story about individuals concerned about their health and safety and knew they needed to continue to go to work in order to put food on their own families table.,63,,
392,0.97,3183.28,3186.149,Many of these workers were represented by unions and are paid the minimum wage.,63,,
393,0.97,3186.149,3202.098,"Some have benefits through employers and negotiations with their Union, but still the risks they were taking were severe to our community and wanting to make sure that we compensated them for this risk.",63,,
394,0.97,3202.098,3205.202,We followed their Testimon.,63,,
395,0.97,3205.202,3209.306,We follow the guidance from data that we received from public health.,63,,
396,0.97,3209.306,3213.577,We looked at the health and safety risks they were facing and reacted with urgency.,63,,
397,0.97,3213.577,3236.733,We followed through on recommendations that came from national studies and looked at the rates of exposure to Covid and the number of folks who were infected and ultimately lost their lives due to Covid and so grocery store workers were five times more likely than those in the community to interact with customers and also potentially get exposed to Covid.,63,,
398,0.97,3236.733,3256.052,"We know that hazard pay could not fix the extreme risk of Covid, but it certainly provided an additional boost to workers who are already taking extreme risk and I am proud of the city for being able to advance these important labor standards, but this is not a long-term measure.",63,,
399,0.97,3256.052,3264.694,"We know it is important to follow up with other measures to make sure that especially are essential workers, in the wake of Covid, have additional protections.",63,,
400,0.97,3264.694,3270.467,But this legislation was not intended to be permanent.,63,,
401,0.97,3270.467,3286.683,"It was not a permanent wage replacement and in the passage of the bill initially we noted her intent to consider modifying or eliminating the requirements after four months of implementation, pending review of current health, safety, and economic risk for front-line workers during Covid.",63,,
402,0.97,3286.683,3310.874,"On June 15 we had a panel discussion with representatives from the grocery industry, grocery workers and their representatives, as well as the interim director for public health Seattle King County, who celebrated the progress we have made so far, post Covid-19, and acknowledged some of the real disparities that exist and ongoing measures needed to make sure we continue to have access to health and safety protocols and clear mask guidelines.",63,,
403,0.97,3310.874,3326.222,"During the panel, and afterward, we received numerous data points that indicate we are still on a strong trajectory toward vaccinating, especially front-line workers and our community in general in King County.",63,,
404,0.97,3326.222,3337.434,"King County has hosted several grocery store worker vaccination sites in partnership with employers, as well, and I did have the opportunity to volunteer at one of those clinics.",63,,
405,0.97,3337.434,3343.44,I greatly appreciate the work of local 21 in helping expedite the vaccination of their members.,63,,
406,0.97,3343.44,3364.327,"Based on the data and panel presentation we received, the amendment in front of us is an amendment to the original legislation that passed, to consider eliminating the hazard pay portion of the requirement that required hazard pay, but we are going to be able to keep intact the Recordkeeping components and additional provisions in the legislation.",63,,
407,0.97,3364.327,3371.301,"I wanted to note from public health King County, important statistics.",63,,
408,0.97,3371.301,3385.181,"We do know that as of July 6, public health Seattle King County has reported 72.9 percent of residents 12 and over have been fully Vaccinated and at least 79.1 have been completely Vaccinated.",63,,
409,0.97,3385.181,3388.385,"Excuse me, have completed at least one dose.",63,,
410,0.97,3388.385,3400.296,"In talking with King County public health yesterday, they know we have made significant improvements in Vaccinations for the Latino and black populations, with both hovering around 60% of full vaccination.",63,,
411,0.97,3400.296,3408.805,Overall we anticipate there will be growth in that vaccination rate and they are doing targeted vaccination efforts.,63,,
412,0.97,3408.805,3421.217,"I asked them if they needed additional support and they said they received sufficient support from the Federal Government and are doing targeted clinics for diverse populations, including Latino and black populations.",63,,
413,0.97,3421.217,3436.032,"Overall they noted we anticipate the fully Vaccinated population receiving two doses required, we anticipate that our community will be 80% fully Vaccinated within the next 2 to 3 weeks.",63,,
414,0.97,3436.032,3475.572,"With this information, I ask if there are any concerns or any red flags on this moving forward and given the trajectory, if there are no red flags at this moment, I would like to turn it over to Karina bull to provide any additional information on what this legislation does, but I wanted to root our conversation in these public health statistics and also note that even when this legislation potentially goes away, specific to hazard pay, there is much more we will continue to do to make sure we are lifting up protections and health and safety concerns, especially for front-line workers and we will be strong partners with public health as we address any disparities that continue to exist.",63,,
415,0.97,3475.572,3476.84,I will turn it over to you.,63,,
416,0.97,3476.84,3482.078,Thank you.,64,,
417,0.97,3482.078,3509.505,"Your presentation on the legislation was very comprehensive, so the only thing that I would add is that this is not emergency legislation, like the legislation was to establish the requirements, so these amendments would take effect 30 days after the Mayor's signature, depending on when that signature would happen, it would be somewhere between mid to late August, end of August, that the hazard pay requirements would end.",64,,
418,0.97,3509.505,3522.719,"So, the office of labor standards could work with the Mayor to make sure the exact date is given in advance to businesses and workers, so they have more information about these changes.",64,,
419,0.97,3522.719,3523.086,Excellent.,65,,
420,0.97,3523.086,3527.023,Are there any additional questions?,65,,
421,0.97,3527.023,3530.226,"Councilmember Herbold, vice chair, please go ahead.",65,,
422,0.97,3530.226,3538.735,"Before I get into my question about the policy itself, is the intent to vote on this today?",66,,
423,0.97,3538.735,3542.005,"Yes, Councilmember Herbold, it is.",67,,
424,0.97,3542.005,3556.853,"So, the current legislation that we would be amending--what does it currently say about the end of hazard pay?",68,,
425,0.97,3556.853,3565.762,So right now the legislation says that hazard pay requirements would end when they Covid emergency ends.,69,,
426,0.97,3565.762,3573.469,"The Mayor's civil emergency and Declaration of emergency would end and that would end the hazard pay requirements, would end.",69,,
427,0.97,3573.469,3577.373,The rest of the Recordkeeping enforcement would end three years later.,69,,
428,0.97,3577.373,3586.215,That is similar to the terms we have created for other Covid related legislation.,70,,
429,0.97,3586.215,3595.592,"Sometimes we have sort of created a buffer, 3 to 6 months after with some of the legislation.",70,,
430,0.97,3595.592,3632.829,"I am thinking also of the hazard pay legislation that we enacted for food delivery drivers and I just don't understand why, given that, knock on wood, we are hopefully coming close to the end of the state of emergency, why we would not just maintain the end date for this benefit that was necessary when we passed the legislation, thought would be necessary, through the end of the state of emergency.",70,,
431,0.97,3632.829,3635.431,Why we would not just maintain that date.,70,,
432,0.97,3635.431,3639.135,I can Chime in a little bit.,71,,
433,0.97,3639.135,3651.547,"Regarding the legislation in front of us, we did put in a four month look back and wanted to have a conversation for months after it was enacted to keep that progress.",71,,
434,0.97,3651.547,3708.504,"I think based on the information in the meeting and both from representative workers, through local 21 and the industry, given the work specific to the industry, the targeted vaccination clinics that have happened and the work that has been done to try to make sure that community specifically, those workers specifically had access to vaccines, it felt like there had been a concentrated effort to make sure those folks were actually fully Vaccinated and given cooperation, collaboration, both between the Union and the employers and trying to vaccinate those workers specifically, I think that is why I felt comfortable moving forward with the request to lift the hazard pay, only because that had been such a concentrated effort to try to make sure those workers were Vaccinated.",71,,
435,0.97,3708.504,3717.914,I do not know that that same type of concentrated effort to vaccinate other front-line workers has taken place to that level.,71,,
436,0.97,3717.914,3738.034,"At least I am not aware of it, so I cannot speak as to whether or not the time is right for those other pieces, but specific to this one, that is where I felt like the four months look back was an appropriate time to take that assessment and then given the information received about Vaccinations that have taken place for these workers, that is where the difference, in my opinion, comes through.",71,,
437,0.97,3738.034,3771.968,"I appreciate that and Conceptualizing the termination of hazard pay in this way, we can argue that we are not sort of creating a precedent for other Covid related term benefits, whether or not we are talking about, you know, obviously the Eviction moratorium or hazard pay for food service workers.",72,,
438,0.97,3771.968,3792.388,"So, that is really helpful, but I still have the same question, given that it seems like maybe this is a little bit of a distinction without a difference, because of it is not going to go into effect until 30 days after signing it again, I am knocking on wood.",72,,
439,0.97,3792.388,3800.797,I am hoping that we will be seeing the end of the state of emergency in early fall.,72,,
440,0.97,3800.797,3810.173,I just am not quite sure I understand why we need to do this now.,72,,
441,0.97,3810.173,3810.973,I appreciate that.,73,,
442,0.97,3810.973,3817.48,"I think that part of the calculation on the timing is also Aligning with the beginning of September, going back to school.",73,,
443,0.97,3817.48,3846.409,"In fact, what I was going to ask you all for, with your support of this legislation today and in conversation with both the Mayor's office and the okay of the Council President, I was going to ask for us to actually wait to have this taken up on the Monday, July 26 meeting, which puts us into the September return to school Timeframe.",73,,
444,0.97,3846.409,3851.414,I think that gives us the question you are talking about for it to go into effect.,73,,
445,0.97,3851.414,3858.721,"In terms of Y on our community Committee, I think frankly it is the amount of work on our workload coming up.",73,,
446,0.97,3858.721,3865.228,Both that and the commitment of coming back to look at this in a four months period.,73,,
447,0.97,3865.228,3876.372,We have the meeting in mid-June and this was the subsequent follow-up meeting to put it on the agenda and to move forward with our data backed rationale for why this population specifically can move forward.,73,,
448,0.97,3876.372,3884.747,Both the policy align and timing a line for our community today.,73,,
449,0.97,3884.747,3894.657,"We do have a number of things coming up for the July 20 meeting, so I wanted to see if this was possible to move forward today, recognizing we still have 30 days until the Mayor signs it.",73,,
450,0.97,3894.657,3899.629,"That does align more with the timing you're talking about, I believe, for when kids return to school.",73,,

453,0.97,3917.246,3917.613,Sorry for that.,74,,

455,0.97,3919.448,3923.819,That is my mistake.,75,,
456,0.97,3923.819,3928.925,Is there a procedural step that is needed?,75,,

458,0.97,3933.095,3940.336,"I think if you did not NOTE it for vote today, we cannot take a vote on it.",76,,
459,0.97,3940.336,3941.537,Okay.,77,,

465,0.97,3979.775,3984.18,"I think the intention, as we described in June, was to bring this back for consideration and possible vote.",79,,

467,0.97,4005.167,4018.214,"That would give us a little bit extra time to consider the legislation before final vote, so if you are comfortable with suspending the rules today, knowing that there would be two weeks before it came to full Council, that would be my preference today.",79,,
468,0.97,4018.214,4020.182,Okay.,79,,

533,0.97,4360.622,4365.694,"Colleagues, I want to start with a huge note of congratulations.",106,,
534,0.97,4365.694,4380.342,"We talked about this a little bit at briefing, but we received great news in the last month and that is the court had upheld the legal validity of our Jumpstart bill, the progressive revenue that you all passed last year.",106,,
535,0.97,4380.342,4384.813,Thank you again for the Cosponsorship of the members of this Committee.,106,,
536,0.97,4384.813,4390.686,You were all cosponsors and I greatly appreciate your leadership on this as we Crafted the legislation with hundreds of community members.,106,,
537,0.97,4390.686,4404.399,I think it has been widely acknowledged by Council president in the last few weeks that the passage of Jumpstart really has helped Seattle be different from other cities were trying to plug budget holes.,106,,
538,0.97,4404.399,4407.102,It prevented us from having to lay folks off.,106,,
539,0.97,4407.102,4413.208,It helped continue essential community services and the city remains economically resilient.,106,,
540,0.97,4413.208,4421.25,"It is, I think, an important court victory and an important recognition of the foresight from this Council to pass progressive revenue.",106,,
541,0.97,4421.25,4423.619,We also had the foresight to include a spending plan.,106,,
542,0.97,4423.619,4437.666,"A detailed spend plan that begins in essence in 2022 to focus on permanent housing solutions, equitable development and funding, and economic resilience.",106,,
543,0.97,4437.666,4449.011,"Economic resilience for things like making sure we can attract more visitors and tourists and create a downtown that is driving that has folks coming to our hotels and that is good for the hotel workers, as well.",106,,
544,0.97,4449.011,4458.12,"I know this has been widely applauded by a diverse set of Stakeholders, including folks from large and small businesses, labor and community partners.",106,,
545,0.97,4458.12,4467.229,This is a really exciting opportunity for us to reflect back on the hard work that we all did almost exactly a year ago to the week.,106,,
546,0.97,4467.229,4472.768,We passed this legislation and we want to make sure we are moving forward.,106,,
547,0.97,4472.768,4474.97,Moving forward with the commitments that the community put in place.,106,,
548,0.97,4474.97,4479.374,Moving forward on some of the commitments that we made with the rescue plan we passed two weeks ago.,106,,
549,0.97,4479.374,4488.383,That helped create an On-Ramp into some of the investments we're talking about here in terms of housing and economic resilience.,106,,
550,0.97,4488.383,4491.253,Importantly I want to note two things of this legislation.,106,,
551,0.97,4491.253,4515.611,"Number one, this legislation by creating a Jumpstart fund helps us identify how much is coming in from the Jumpstart tax specifically, so we have greater accountability and transparency over how much the tax is raising and it helps us make good on our commitments that we made to the large coalition of Stakeholders who helped craft the spend plan in front of us.",106,,
552,0.97,4515.611,4527.723,"Both of these goals are critical for us to make sure we are making investments, especially in vulnerable communities and specifically making sure that Jumpstart dollars are added to additional investments that our city has committed to.",106,,
553,0.97,4527.723,4534.229,We want to make sure we are investing in areas that are often put on the back Burner.,106,,
554,0.97,4534.229,4536.598,"Affordable development, housing dollars, green new deal priorities.",106,,
555,0.97,4536.598,4543.238,These are priority dollars for Jumpstart and the city budget should be added to these funds.,106,,
556,0.97,4543.238,4551.546,That is what we committed to and the concept of having a Jumpstart fund helps create additional transparency and accountability for how we spend those dollars.,106,,
557,0.97,4551.546,4562.958,I really want to thank the folks who have been working with us in the creation of Jumpstart since last spring.,106,,
558,0.97,4562.958,4566.628,The years of momentum by Community partners calling for a progressive tax system in the state and city.,106,,
559,0.97,4566.628,4586.181,"We can act and we have acted to create additional dollars, which, the majority of which will be going into housing to address the most pressing crises in the city and also with funding going into equitable development and economic resilience, making sure we are Crating that more equitable local economy.",106,,
560,0.97,4586.181,4597.592,"I will turn it over to Aly to walk us through what the legislation does today and in addition to creating the Fund, there are other important components.",106,,
561,0.97,4597.592,4610.505,One is the creation of the oversight board and the second is smart budgeting strategies to make sure we are prepared if there is ever another downturn like what we saw coming our way due to Covid.,106,,
562,0.97,4610.505,4617.212,We have written legislation to make sure we have a budgeting valve as well.,106,,
563,0.97,4617.212,4621.016,I think this is a great opportunity to move forward on commitments and see these dollars coming in soon.,106,,
564,0.97,4621.016,4629.958,It will be something the entire community can be really proud of.,106,,
565,0.97,4629.958,4631.526,"Aly, I will turn it over to you.",106,,
566,0.97,4631.526,4632.427,Thank you.,107,,
567,0.97,4632.427,4637.065,"I am Aly Pennucci, council central staff.",107,,
568,0.97,4637.065,4647.242,"Council bill 120118 would create a new tax Fund, as chairman Mosqueda described, in the city Treasury.",107,,
569,0.97,4647.242,4654.149,It provides transparency in the budget for the use of revenues from the payroll expense tax authorized about one year ago.,107,,
570,0.97,4654.149,4673.635,"The Council provided clear direction on the authorized uses of these funds in the Jumpstart spending plan passed by the Council on July 6, 2020, through 126109 and further detailed the spending priorities on July 20, 2020.",107,,
571,0.97,4673.635,4692.354,"Information available to the Council to date does not make clear how the payroll tax revenues will be proposed by the Mayor for allocation in the 2022 proposed budget, which is why the chair has proposed creating this fund.",107,,
572,0.97,4692.354,4704.533,This is a strategy available to the Council to codify in code the authorized uses of payroll tax revenues and to ensure the legislative intent is clear and increased transparency as we head into the fall budget process.,107,,
573,0.97,4704.533,4714.743,"However, the executive can still present a budget in consistency with these policies.",107,,
574,0.97,4714.743,4720.315,They can do that by transmitting a proposed budget with legislation that would amend these policies to agree with their spending proposals.,107,,
575,0.97,4720.315,4732.794,"However, creating this would make it easier for us to track and make it clear where there are inconsistencies or points of departure.",107,,
576,0.97,4732.794,4740.235,"In creating this new Fund, the payroll expense tax revenues would be deposited into the Jumpstart Fund, with policies directing spending consistent with the previously approved spending plan.",107,,
577,0.97,4740.235,4777.038,"As chair Mosqueda described, that includes 60% of funds for affordable housing, 15% for economic revitalization, 9% to support the equitable development initiative investment, 9% for green new deal investment and I will note that that is consistent with when creating the green new deal advisory board, as well as the implementation strategies, it was requested that there be a dedicated funding source, so that would fulfill that commitment previously approved by the Council.",107,,
578,0.97,4777.038,4785.78,"Up to 5% of revenues can be used for administering the tax and associated investments, as well as evaluation work on the investments.",107,,
579,0.97,4785.78,4808.837,"So, the spending plan directed spending on all of the revenues to be used for these purposes in 2022 and beyond, resent revenue forecasts indicate that in the near term, some amount of support for continuity of General fund services may be necessary to avoid reductions in base services in 2022 and perhaps in future years.",107,,
580,0.97,4808.837,4826.888,"So the policies proposed in this legislation deviate from the spending plan previously approved by the Council in one way, acknowledging that in 2022 or future years, General fund revenues may not fully recover to Pre-Pandemic projections.",107,,
581,0.97,4826.888,4834.396,The proposed policies allow for a portion of revenues to be used to provide that continuity of services.,107,,
582,0.97,4834.396,4837.732,"That has allowed, until base revenues rebound to Pre- pandemic levels.",107,,
583,0.97,4837.732,4856.851,"As described in more detail in the staff memo, based on the most recent revenue forecast presented in April by the city budget office, we would anticipate that about half of the payroll tax revenues anticipated in 2022 will be needed to provide continuity of base city services.",107,,
584,0.97,4856.851,4866.695,"If future forecasts indicate revenue is rebounding to Pre- pandemic levels, reliance on the payroll tax revenues to support those services will decrease.",107,,
585,0.97,4866.695,4876.338,"On the other hand, if we see a greater decrease in base revenues, more of the payroll tax revenue would be needed to support those base services.",107,,
586,0.97,4876.338,4896.291,"So, similar to what was permitted in 2021, the payroll tax would help ward against cuts to base city services and staff layoffs that would impact programs that the city manages.",107,,
587,0.97,4896.291,4906.668,"So, one thing I will note for the committee consideration, creating a new fund does introduce complexities, such as managing and monitoring cash balances for the fund and additional reporting and monitoring.",107,,
588,0.97,4906.668,4919.414,"I will NOTE--excuse me, this introduces administrative work for the budget office and apartments that will receive funds from the payroll tax.",107,,
589,0.97,4919.414,4929.858,I will also note that up to 5% of revenues can be used for administering the tax and proposed investments.,107,,
590,0.97,4929.858,4957.052,"This can include supporting the additional administrative burden of implementing the Jumpstart Fund and if this bill is passed and apartments determine additional resources are needed to manage the Fund, the Council could consider modifying the amount of revenues that could be allocated to the administrative costs, so some of this would be, you know, learning as we go and inventing fall policies in the future.",107,,
591,0.97,4957.052,4960.055,I will NOTE you may be hearing from the city budget office at some point.,107,,
592,0.97,4960.055,4964.759,"We will be discussing at a future committee meeting, legislation to authorize an Interfund loan.",107,,
593,0.97,4964.759,4979.441,"This is to address cash flow issues the city is facing, due in part to win payments for the payroll tax for 2021 will be remitted.",107,,
594,0.97,4979.441,4983.611,"We are not expecting payments until the end of the first quarter, 2022.",107,,
595,0.97,4983.611,4993.388,"As well as other obligations on the city budget, such as expenditures related to the emergency, where we may be awaiting FEMA reimbursement and those types of situations.",107,,
596,0.97,4993.388,5019.981,"Creating this fund may create complexities in implementing and how that is structured and may require more than one piece of legislation in the next six months to a year that the Council will have to consider, in terms of loans, but if we are able to work closely with the budget office, we believe we can address those complexities.",107,,
597,0.97,5019.981,5036.231,The budget office did offer one suggested modification to the proposal to mitigate some of the administrative burden which is described in amendment one proposed by chair Mosqueda and posted to the agenda.,107,,
598,0.97,5036.231,5040.902,"Chair Mosqueda, would you like me to describe that or would you first like to pause for questions?",107,,
599,0.97,5040.902,5049.644,"Let's pause for questions and then we can talk about the amendment, but thank you for walking us through that.",108,,
600,0.97,5049.644,5064.959,"As a reminder to folks, the 2021 payroll tax, yes, does not get paid until the first quarter of 2022, so that is where some of that lag comes in and I appreciate you flagging the upcoming bill that is already in discussion.",108,,
601,0.97,5064.959,5068.53,We will have a meeting next week.,108,,
602,0.97,5068.53,5085.013,"We do have opportunities, I think, to address the cash flow issue and again, I think having this fund helps us make sure there is transparency in how those dollars flow to the Jumpstart Fund and the general Fund, so we can continue to make necessary investments and add to the investments.",108,,
603,0.97,5085.013,5087.749,Are there any additional questions?,108,,
604,0.97,5087.749,5088.183,Okay.,108,,
605,0.97,5088.183,5110.171,"Thank you for your summary and again, thanks to the city budget office for their suggested amendment to make sure the administrative portion, again, when we passed Jumpstart Seattle revenue proposal last year, we included 5% going to administrative costs.",108,,
606,0.97,5110.171,5117.278,"I am happy to make this accommodation to make sure the funding remains in the general Fund, to streamline the management of these dollars.",108,,
607,0.97,5117.278,5118.613,That is no problem.,108,,
608,0.97,5118.613,5121.316,"So, Aly, do you want to describe --",108,,
609,0.97,5121.316,5126.221,"Thank you, chair Mosqueda.",109,,
610,0.97,5126.221,5130.091,I will share my screen.,109,,
611,0.97,5130.091,5131.826,So you can see the amendment.,109,,
612,0.97,5131.826,5137.198,The amendment would modify section 1 of the proposed bill.,109,,
613,0.97,5137.198,5138.666,Can you see that okay?,109,,
614,0.97,5138.666,5146.941,"We can and if you could Scroll slightly below, so we can see the impact statement, that was helpful.",110,,
615,0.97,5146.941,5147.342,Great.,110,,
616,0.97,5147.342,5147.942,"Oh, one more back.",110,,
617,0.97,5147.942,5148.343,Yeah.,110,,
618,0.97,5148.343,5162.223,"Okay, so this AMENDS section 1 of the proposed legislation, that would allow the 5% allocated for administrative costs to be deposited directly into the general fund.",111,,
619,0.97,5162.223,5187.515,"Because the other 95% of the funds will be distributed to multiple departments, having to track separately and allocate that 5% of the payroll tax from the fund to the various departments creates a lot of administrative work that I don't think will add a lot of value to our oversight of the expenditures.",111,,
620,0.97,5187.515,5201.796,So this would simplify that piece of the proposal by allowing those dollars to go into the general Fund and to be used to support the administrative evaluation and oversight of this Fund and the remaining 95% would go directly into the fund.,111,,
621,0.97,5201.796,5207.068,That is all I have.,111,,
622,0.97,5207.068,5208.903,Are there any questions about this amendment?,112,,
623,0.97,5208.903,5212.54,I am not seeing any questions.,112,,
624,0.97,5212.54,5223.318,"Okay, thanks again, I appreciate the opportunity to bring forward this amendment for the 5% of funds to go directly to administration remaining in the general fund.",112,,
625,0.97,5223.318,5232.093,I appreciate the response we have heard about how to make it easier to administer this tax and I'm happy to advance that today.,112,,
626,0.97,5232.093,5238.666,"Colleagues I move consideration of the bill, so it will be in front of us, so we can then consider the amendment.",112,,
627,0.97,5238.666,5239.5,Okay.,112,,
628,0.97,5239.5,5241.402,Thank you.,112,,
629,0.97,5241.402,5253.147,Has been moved and Seconded that the committee consider recommendation to pass Council 120118.,112,,
630,0.97,5253.147,5258.853,"Excuse me, now is when I move the amendment, correct?",112,,
631,0.97,5258.853,5263.958,"Okay, thank you.",112,,
632,0.97,5263.958,5278.172,"Colleagues, I would like to move to amend Council bill 120118 as presented and described by Aly.",112,,
633,0.97,5278.172,5278.773,Second.,113,,
634,0.97,5278.773,5280.174,It has been moved and Seconded.,114,,
635,0.97,5280.174,5282.577,Are there additional comments or questions on the amendment?,114,,
636,0.97,5282.577,5289.083,"Hearing none, Madam clerk will you please call the roll on the passage of amendment number one?",114,,
637,0.97,5289.083,5294.789,Chair Mosqueda.,115,,
638,0.97,5294.789,5295.189,Aye.,116,,
639,0.97,5295.189,5295.79,Herbold.,117,,
640,0.97,5295.79,5296.057,Yes.,118,,
641,0.97,5296.057,5298.192,Gonzalez.,119,,
642,0.97,5298.192,5301.296,Aye.,120,,
643,0.97,5301.296,5302.263,Councilmember 1024.,121,,
644,0.97,5302.263,5303.498,Aye.,122,,
645,0.97,5303.498,5309.404,That is far in favor and none opposed.,123,,
646,0.97,5309.404,5311.673,The bill as amended is now in front of the committee.,123,,
647,0.97,5311.673,5319.614,Are there any additional comments on the amended bill?,123,,
648,0.97,5319.614,5320.548,"Madam President, please go ahead.",123,,
649,0.97,5320.548,5323.818,"Thank you, chair Mosqueda.",124,,
650,0.97,5323.818,5332.794,I just wanted to say on the record how supportive I am of this particular Council bill.,124,,
651,0.97,5332.794,5356.751,"We in the city council have a history of passing this kind of legislation on these, you know, significant progressive revenue sources, to make sure that we can have that level of transparency and accountability, particularly to the Stakeholders who we make commitments to about what this funding would be utilized for.",124,,
652,0.97,5356.751,5413.007,"It is unfortunate, however, that we are in a situation where we have to do this and I just appreciate, nonetheless, the opportunity to be able to put in some of those Guardrails to be able to ensure that the intent of a super majority of the city council is going to be implemented and followed through on by the executive, so thank you for your wisdom in replicating this model we have used in other contexts to ensure that accountability and that the councils budget appropriation authority is going to be respected in this space and I look forward to working with Aly and other folks on central staff when we do receive the Mayor's proposed budget to ensure compliance with this particular ordinance and several others we have also passed that are similar to this one, so thanks so much, chair Mosqueda, I look forward to voting in support.",124,,
653,0.97,5413.007,5417.311,Thank you and thank you for the context about how this strategy has been used in the past.,125,,
654,0.97,5417.311,5421.783,It is something we see used often at the state level.,125,,
655,0.97,5421.783,5442.069,"I can think about the tobacco cessation fund that was used, championed by the governor at the time, wanting to make sure funds were going to the intended purpose, so from the state to the local level, I think this is an important opportunity for those commitments to be kept when we create funds and create greater transparency and accountability.",125,,
656,0.97,5442.069,5447.341,"I appreciate that and you are right, there was a super majority that passed to begin with and then it was unanimous, the spend plan.",125,,
657,0.97,5447.341,5460.421,So this is really an opportunity for us to put the unanimous agreement from Council into statute and incorporate the important oversight components week included to begin with.,125,,
658,0.97,5460.421,5470.231,"And in case we ever need it, I think it is a smart budgeting tool, as well.",125,,
659,0.97,5470.231,5485.479,"Hopefully we will not need it and we will continue to see these funds grow as anticipated Year-Over-Year and that means additional investments for housing, equitable development, green new deal priorities and all having a positive impact on our smallest businesses and our Bipoc community.",125,,
660,0.97,5485.479,5490.985,Thank you and thank you for your leadership and support.,125,,
661,0.97,5490.985,5492.653,Thank you again vice chair and Councilmember Lewis.,125,,

663,0.97,5498.426,5514.809,"I also want to thank Aly for your work on this, along with Tom and I really want to thank others who have done work on this legislation with us and community partners that continue to write in.",125,,
664,0.97,5514.809,5517.945,"Budget and policy center, tenants rights Union.",125,,
665,0.97,5517.945,5533.094,"We know many advocates have also written and with a desire to see this fund created, so thank you for your support and with that we will consider the amended bill in front of us.",125,,
666,0.97,5533.094,5543.204,"Colleagues, we have the amended bill in front of us and if there are no additional questions, Madam clerk will you please call the roll on the passage of Council bill 120118 as amended?",125,,

672,0.97,5555.016,5556.417,Yes.,131,,
673,0.97,5556.417,5561.322,"Madam chair, that is far in favor, none opposed.",132,,
674,0.97,5561.322,5566.027,"I did hear the Council President say aye, for the record.",133,,
675,0.97,5566.027,5569.463,"It got cut off, but I did hear it.",133,,
676,0.97,5569.463,5571.198,So we have four in favor and none opposed.,133,,
677,0.97,5571.198,5574.201,It is unanimous and the motion carries.,133,,
678,0.97,5574.201,5580.174,The recommendation that the bill pass as amended will be sent to the June 19 Seattle city council meeting for a final vote.,133,,
679,0.97,5580.174,5587.281,Record time today.,133,,
680,0.97,5587.281,5590.585,"Thank you all for your support on an early Friday morning on a holiday week, as well.",133,,
681,0.97,5590.585,5599.093,"We do have our next meeting on July 20, where we will be with a full agenda in front of us, including appointees, equitable communities initiative update.",133,,
682,0.97,5599.093,5608.002,"We have a recommendation coming down midweek next week, so we will have the opportunity to hear from the task force at that point.",133,,
683,0.97,5608.002,5620.948,"We will have a letter for discussion and the midyear supplemental ordinance, along with the possibility of the Interfund loan that Aly mentioned.",133,,
684,0.97,5620.948,5627.188,So another packed agenda and we will hopefully be talking more about some of those items during Council briefings in the interim.,133,,
685,0.97,5627.188,5628.923,Thanks for joining us today.,133,,
686,0.97,5628.923,5633.828,"Anything else for the good of the order, colleagues?",133,,
687,0.97,5633.828,5638.699,Have a great weekend and I hope you enjoy the weekend and get a lot of rest and relaxation.,133,,
