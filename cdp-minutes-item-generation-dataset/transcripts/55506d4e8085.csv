90,0.97,461.194,481.08,"Less than 48 hours after this incident and while Cal was still unconscious in the hospital, Councilman Lewis had an Afterthought at the very end of the meeting and he spent as much time speaking on this issue as to an off leash dog park.",57,,
91,0.97,481.08,492.658,"In Councilmember Lewis's statements, he claimed the Missteps were simply to add to being do to under stress.",57,,
92,0.97,492.658,504.47,"Just this last Saturday, we memorialized the collapse of the bridge . I'm sure the builders of that bridge also said failure was simply due to being under stress.",57,,
93,0.97,504.47,527.827,This is a shameful excuse . This is a statement about reviewing the footage from Wednesday night that this was worthy of an investigation.,57,,
94,0.97,527.827,531.097,"Again, total failure to our system.",57,,
95,0.97,531.097,538.771,We can no longer afford this.,57,,
