34,0.97,145.745,146.88,Please jump in with any questions.,19,,
35,0.97,146.88,148.615,I know Council President Gonzalez had a question.,19,,
36,0.97,148.615,150.083,We will address that during the presentation.,19,,
37,0.97,150.083,152.452,I just wanted to thank you all for having us this morning.,19,,
38,0.97,152.452,172.772,"Leslie Pollner, our lobbyist, is here . She will be discussing the infrastructure package that has recently passed Congress and some of the key programs that can be Impactful or beneficial to the city . Then, getting into the build back better package and reconciliation and seeing how that might be Impactful and what things we are expecting out of that, knowing it is still being debated in Congress.",19,,
39,0.97,172.772,179.879,"I am going to start the presentation, do a quick Intro and then Leslie will jump in and take over.",19,,
40,0.97,179.879,186.386,Let me share my screen really quick here.,19,,
41,0.97,186.386,188.955,Are we good?,20,,
42,0.97,188.955,191.658,It is working.,21,,
43,0.97,191.658,194.294,"Like I said, we will do a quick introduction here.",22,,
44,0.97,194.294,197.096,"Leslie, do you want to get this going?",22,,
45,0.97,197.096,198.298,Sure thing.,23,,
46,0.97,198.298,201.401,"Thank you, Sierra.",23,,
47,0.97,201.401,208.708,We will try to stay pretty high- level today but happy to do any follow-up conversation if there are questions or if people want to go deeper.,23,,
48,0.97,208.708,224.324,"As well as, Sierra, later on will be sending around a more detailed presentation and breakdown of the bill . These are really the highlights for the purpose of this presentation but we have a much more detailed Synopsis as well.",23,,
49,0.97,224.324,231.431,Let's start with infrastructure . very exciting.,23,,
50,0.97,231.431,235.134,The President signed it into law on November 15.,23,,
51,0.97,235.134,255.421,"As many of you know, that bill is comprised of several different pieces of legislation that had been worked on over previous years including the surface transportation reauthorization act as well as the Digital equity act, which as many of you know, was championed by Senator Murray.",23,,
52,0.97,255.421,256.055,It was her baby.,23,,
53,0.97,256.055,260.96,$1.2 trillion in total spending over five years including $550 billion in New spending.,23,,
54,0.97,260.96,263.296,"Very, very historic investments.",23,,
55,0.97,263.296,265.765,Let me say a couple of things at the outset.,23,,
56,0.97,265.765,270.069,I work with a number of these across the country.,23,,
57,0.97,270.069,272.271,I want a level set on this.,23,,
58,0.97,272.271,277.377,"The question that I have gotten a number of times is, how much money is my city getting?",23,,
59,0.97,277.377,287.887,"I want to say from the outset that this bill is quite different from what we have seen in Coronavirus legislation, the American rescue plan act or the cares act.",23,,
60,0.97,287.887,297.93,"This will not provide significant, direct funding to the city . rather, there are several different pots of money.",23,,
61,0.97,297.93,304.804,Some of it will flow by formula to the state and then through to Puget sound regional Council.,23,,
62,0.97,304.804,309.242,The other big challenge will be through competitive grant opportunities.,23,,
63,0.97,309.242,329.128,"I will let Sierra talk at the end but the work that we are currently doing is with city departments to get everyone ready and in position to take advantage of this funding, as well as working with Federal agencies to help shape their notice of funding opportunities that they are expected to release next year.",23,,
64,0.97,329.128,330.063,"Next slide, please.",23,,
65,0.97,330.063,345.345,"There is significant historic levels of investment across the board, roads and bridges, energy, infrastructure, transportation, climate resiliency, and water infrastructure.",24,,
66,0.97,345.345,347.447,"Next slide, please.",24,,
67,0.97,347.447,354.554,Just a quick Timeline here around implementation overview.,25,,
68,0.97,354.554,366.132,"They have a Backdate implementation date to October 1 . right now, what you are seeing across agencies is that they are really trying to get ready and get organized.",25,,
69,0.97,366.132,381.38,"For the Department of transportation, for example, it is literally almost quadrupling the level of funding they have had in the past . Even for some agencies, they are seeing 10 fold increases in the amount of funding that they will get.",25,,
70,0.97,381.38,389.889,A lot of this is really getting their thoughts and their ideas organized because there is a lot of new programs that they need to set up here.,25,,
71,0.97,389.889,398.064,"One thing that is COMP locating this, as many of you have seen, Congress had to pass a continuing resolution into February to keep the government funded.",25,,
72,0.97,398.064,406.773,"Some, not all, of the funding for the infrastructure bill is tied up in that measure as well.",25,,
73,0.97,406.773,411.611,That is adding a little bit of a layer of complexity as D.O.T.,25,,
74,0.97,411.611,413.079,Gets ready to unveil these grants.,25,,
75,0.97,413.079,424.423,Just putting that out there that this is something that is unfortunate . They are trying to work through it but it may delay a little bit some of the programs and their abilities to release them.,25,,
76,0.97,424.423,425.425,"Next slide, please.",25,,
77,0.97,425.425,454.053,"Just to give you some high level highlights here of programs that are of interest, these are largely going to be competitive grant programs that the city will be well positioned to compete for and that includes raise grants which, as many of you know, we just successfully received $20 million for improvement projects thanks to send a Cadwell, Senator Murray and all of their work.",26,,
78,0.97,454.053,459.959,Raise has been a great project for the city of Seattle.,26,,
79,0.97,459.959,463.963,There will be $7.5 billion over five years available for that program.,26,,
80,0.97,463.963,469.535,We have vision zero implementation dollars.,26,,
81,0.97,469.535,476.843,"To date, there has not been funding around vision zero to actually implement it . There has only been planning dollars.",26,,
82,0.97,476.843,478.277,This is also fairly historic.,26,,
83,0.97,478.277,482.582,There is also a new smart grant program.,26,,
84,0.97,482.582,487.32,Many of you may remember that President Obama in his final years started the smart city challenge.,26,,
85,0.97,487.32,492.492,That funding went to one city in the country.,26,,
86,0.97,492.492,502.001,"This is now funding to try to implement intelligent transportation systems, connected vehicles to improve transportation efficiency and safety using technology.",26,,
87,0.97,502.001,502.935,"Next slide, please.",26,,
88,0.97,502.935,520.319,There is also a new competitive grant program as well as formula funding for bridges . There is a new railroad crossing elimination competitive program.,27,,
89,0.97,520.319,524.123,"There is a new active transportation infrastructure program for trails, bike paths.",27,,
90,0.97,524.123,536.869,"There is also a new Colbert removal, replacement and restoration program as well, which I know is of great interest to Seattle public utilities.",27,,
91,0.97,536.869,537.67,"Next slide, please.",27,,
92,0.97,537.67,545.611,There is quite a bit in the environment and resiliency plan.,28,,
93,0.97,545.611,552.852,There is a new healthy streets program where grants deploy pavements to increase the urban tree canopy cover.,28,,
94,0.97,552.852,563.162,"There is significant funding for Ev charging, formula funding that will go to the state as well as competitive grant funding.",28,,
95,0.97,563.162,573.205,"One of the direct funding sources that will be coming to the city is the energy, efficiency and conservation block grant funding and that is funding by formula, very flexible.",28,,
96,0.97,573.205,579.178,It is a program that was created in 2009. that has come back as well.,28,,
97,0.97,579.178,582.381,"Next slide, please.",28,,
98,0.97,582.381,595.061,"Then there is funding to protect the electric grid . The grid resilience grant program, upgrading electric grid right ability and a smart grid investing grant program.",29,,
99,0.97,595.061,602.401,"Seattle city light has been all over this, putting themselves in position to get some of these dollars as well.",29,,
100,0.97,602.401,603.002,"Next slide, please.",29,,
101,0.97,603.002,608.975,One of the biggest sources of funding is around water and clean water.,30,,
102,0.97,608.975,623.489,There is significant increases for the state revolving road funds . There is a new clean water structure and Sustainability grant program and there is a new wastewater efficiency grant pilot program as well.,30,,
103,0.97,623.489,624.39,"Next slide, please.",30,,
104,0.97,624.39,650.349,"Then, the infrastructure bill does include funding for Cyber . There is a brand-new state and local Cyber security grant program and also there is funding for the currently existing Bric program . next slide, please.",31,,
105,0.97,650.349,653.686,Then there is funding for Broadband.,32,,
106,0.97,653.686,665.531,The biggest portion of funding for Broadband goes through the state B formula and the legislation SETS out parameters that the state needs to follow as they are creating the funding plans and the priorities.,32,,
107,0.97,665.531,674.874,"Once they have checked the boxes in terms of demonstrating that they have already served Unserved communities, it then gives the state more flexibility.",32,,
108,0.97,674.874,689.288,"Then there is a new competitive grant program modeled after Senator Murray's legislation, the Digital equity competitive grant program for local governments and Nonprofits to increase Digital equity.",32,,
109,0.97,689.288,690.189,"Next slide, please.",32,,
110,0.97,690.189,694.593,Moving on for a moment to reconciliation.,33,,
111,0.97,694.593,722.388,"Obviously the House passed build back better . Obviously there was a real leadership role there . Now it moves on to the Senate . This week, the Senate parliamentarian is giving the bill what is known as the birdbath where she is going through to make sure that the bill Comports with all of the reconciliation procedures.",33,,
112,0.97,722.388,730.763,We expect that there will be changes made to the bill as a result of the birdbath . leader Schumer has said he wants to have a vote before Christmas.,33,,
113,0.97,730.763,741.841,"Obviously you are seeing Senator Joe Manchin having concerns about deflation, having concerns about some of the pieces in the bill.",33,,
114,0.97,741.841,747.813,We expect negotiations to be ongoing.,33,,
115,0.97,747.813,760.159,There is a chance that we will see the same dance that we saw in the house where leader Schumer will put the bill on the floor and an effort to force the senators to say what they want.,33,,
116,0.97,760.159,777.476,"As you have seen in the press, Joe Manchin is a top negotiating partner and it is hard to nail him down but most people anticipate that final action will take place in early Q1 next year . Once the Senate takes action, the bill will go to the house.",33,,
117,0.97,777.476,781.58,The House at that point won't be able to make changes unless they want to delay the process even further.,33,,
118,0.97,781.58,787.586,Final passage would be expected there . I will say this.,33,,
119,0.97,787.586,794.393,Most people who are watching this process still think that some version of build back at her will get approved early next year.,33,,
120,0.97,794.393,796.295,"Next slide, please.",33,,
121,0.97,796.295,800.966,Just a quick overview of this bill.,34,,
122,0.97,800.966,812.411,"A huge pot of money for a number of pieces that were not touched in infrastructure, things like $400 billion for universal Pre-K and affordable Childcare.",34,,
123,0.97,812.411,823.989,That money is predominantly going to the state for distribution . funding for housing to the tune of $150 billion.,34,,
124,0.97,823.989,830.496,Pots of money there would go directly to the city including $3 billion for homes.,34,,
125,0.97,830.496,836.202,There is also funding around college Affordability although they were not able to do President Biden's college plan.,34,,
126,0.97,836.202,843.642,They are trying to increase Pell grants and other means to make college more affordable.,34,,
127,0.97,843.642,845.01,"Then, funding as well around Healthcare.",34,,
128,0.97,845.01,846.011,"Next slide, please.",34,,
129,0.97,846.011,873.606,"Again, some of these programs, there is a range of transportation, climate, and equity programs that are being included here . You are hearing now that Senator Kyrsten Sinema and Senator Joe Manchin are getting concerned about certain parts of these programs in particular because they perceive it to be double Fibbing.",35,,
130,0.97,873.606,881.113,You may remember that President Biden had made a pledge that he would not fund things that had been funded in infrastructure again in reconciliation.,35,,
131,0.97,881.113,902.801,"For example, we are hearing today that Senator Kyrsten Sinema has concerns . lots of work will be done to push back on this but putting that out there because these are some of the issues that they are trying to deal with.",35,,
132,0.97,902.801,904.603,"Next slide, please.",35,,
133,0.97,904.603,909.908,"Then, housing finally getting into this bill.",36,,
134,0.97,909.908,917.016,"Very exciting, huge investment.",36,,
135,0.97,917.016,938.737,"As I mentioned previously, funding for homes, funding for a new program that would provide grants to local governments to look at their zoning and to try to think constructively about how to change them in laws.",36,,
136,0.97,938.737,939.338,"Next slide, please.",36,,
137,0.97,939.338,949.114,"Completely left out of infrastructure also was public safety . There is additional funding here for firefighter grants, for next Gen 911 systems as well as for FEMA.",37,,
138,0.97,949.114,959.925,There are community prevention grants . This is largely around mental health and alternative response for communities.,37,,
139,0.97,959.925,960.993,"Next slide, please.",37,,
140,0.97,960.993,983.082,"I am going to turn this over to Sierra to talk a little bit about what is happening in the city to get ready for all of this . I think primarily the guidance that we have been giving to folks is to get ready now, to remember that this is multiyear funding . You don't need to apply for everything this year.",38,,
141,0.97,983.082,987.086,"That said, we are in a unique political environment.",38,,
142,0.97,987.086,997.396,"It is very dynamic . at the moment, it is a friendlier environment to Seattle than the previous administration.",38,,
143,0.97,997.396,998.931,We don't know what will happen in 2024.,38,,
144,0.97,998.931,1007.005,I think it is important to be abreast in these early years.,38,,
145,0.97,1007.005,1015.914,"The other piece, of course, is how important the coordination will be in the region, whether that is with the county or other cities so that not everybody is going for the same pot of money all at once.",38,,
146,0.97,1015.914,1018.384,"Sierra, do you want to talk a little bit about your process?",38,,
147,0.97,1018.384,1019.518,"Yeah, just briefly.",39,,
148,0.97,1019.518,1020.819,Thank you.,39,,
149,0.97,1020.819,1025.09,I am working with a smaller Subset of our departments.,39,,
150,0.97,1025.09,1038.237,I do chair a climate and resiliency group that has been talking about some of these programs and issues pretty consistently.,39,,
151,0.97,1038.237,1054.553,"We have taken a smaller Subset of departments that includes our utilities, office of emergency management, and really having them Hone in on what key programs and projects they might want to put forward to access some of this funding.",39,,
152,0.97,1054.553,1062.361,"As Leslie did a great job highlighting, it is an unprecedented amount of funding that will be available.",39,,
153,0.97,1062.361,1068.167,"As she highlighted as well, it will not come directly to the city.",39,,
154,0.97,1068.167,1076.275,"It is those partnerships and the coordination with County and state that will be crucial in making sure that the priorities of the city are represented Regionwide, statewide.",39,,
155,0.97,1076.275,1097.429,"Working with our delegation on this whole process as well, keeping them in the loop . What we are doing is initially having our Department do a sweep of projects and programs and then answering any questions they might have . do they have the capacity and staffing to apply for some of these?",39,,
156,0.97,1097.429,1100.866,Where is it in the list of Prioritization?,39,,
157,0.97,1100.866,1105.104,Then we will have a larger citywide conversation on Prioritization and working with our partners.,39,,
158,0.97,1105.104,1120.018,"As Leslie pointed out, many layers to this . not only identifying what our priorities are but how we are coordinating that with our partners and how we are coordinating that within the timing of this legislation and the current political climate.",39,,
159,0.97,1120.018,1130.395,We do anticipate a great amount of funding coming to our area.,39,,
160,0.97,1130.395,1141.106,"Where the city of Seattle plugs in and is able to access, that is to be determined but we are working hard on getting those initial layers and on the ground conversations happening right now.",39,,
161,0.97,1141.106,1145.744,We have made contact with our regional and state partners but more to come on that.,39,,
162,0.97,1145.744,1147.179,"Anything I am leaving out, Leslie?",39,,
163,0.97,1147.179,1150.816,I think that is great.,40,,
164,0.97,1150.816,1155.254,We will be in touch with more of a concrete plan.,41,,
165,0.97,1155.254,1170.169,"With the new mayoral administration as well, we are hoping to have someone in place in the Mayor's office to help with the coordination of this effort as well so we can do it citywide.",41,,
166,0.97,1170.169,1174.106,We do anticipate and hope to come back to you all and walk through some of the programming.,41,,
167,0.97,1174.106,1194.092,I know that Councilmember Gonzalez already had a question on one of the programs that was available . I anticipate a lot of those questions coming up and making sure that the right city departments are engaged and that we are working with our partners to apply for some of those funds.,41,,
168,0.97,1194.092,1196.962,We will be circulating a more detailed presentation later on this afternoon.,42,,
169,0.97,1196.962,1200.399,Happy to follow up with you or any of your staff as questions arise.,42,,
170,0.97,1200.399,1208.307,"I would reiterate too, in our conversation with our partners, everyone is really at the starting gate here.",43,,
171,0.97,1208.307,1215.614,I don't think anyone is necessarily too far ahead and ready to go on this.,43,,
172,0.97,1215.614,1225.057,I think these questions are still getting formulated . The process is still being formulated.,43,,
173,0.97,1225.057,1229.027,"The city is Well-Positioned right now, I believe, in the work that we are doing in the preparation we are doing.",43,,
174,0.97,1229.027,1234.7,Our lobbying team at Holland & amp; Knight has done a great job to guide us through this process.,43,,
175,0.97,1234.7,1249.748,I think that they also anticipate and hope that city leaders and Department leaders are getting in early with some of the agencies and departments to talk through some of the language and help formulate some of these programs as well.,43,,
176,0.97,1249.748,1252.551,That is a part of our plan.,43,,
177,0.97,1252.551,1255.754,Any questions on that process?,43,,
178,0.97,1255.754,1260.359,Great . I understand that things are still in the works.,44,,
179,0.97,1260.359,1266.765,"Just substantively, can we go back to slide 16?",44,,
180,0.97,1266.765,1267.165,Yes.,45,,
181,0.97,1267.165,1271.269,Here we go.,45,,
182,0.97,1271.269,1286.551,"On the public safety investments, are these also going to get to municipalities like the city of Seattle via the state?",46,,
183,0.97,1286.551,1288.587,I see in the Cybersecurity is says grants for Estate/Locals.,46,,
184,0.97,1288.587,1302.701,Just trying to get a better sense of how cities--how the grant is being planned for by the Federal Government at this point.,46,,
185,0.97,1302.701,1309.608,"Just to clarify, on a Cyber or public safety generally?",47,,
186,0.97,1309.608,1311.91,Generally.,48,,
187,0.97,1311.91,1326.224,"A lot of this will be competitive grant opportunities that the city would be eligible to apply for, particularly in the Cyber realm as well as the community violence intervention grant . those are all anticipated to be competitive.",49,,
188,0.97,1326.224,1328.727,Okay.,50,,
189,0.97,1328.727,1339.104,"If I understand your answer correctly, in this docket, cities like the city of Seattle could apply for grants directly to the Federal Government.",50,,
190,0.97,1339.104,1340.338,There will be no Pass-Through?,50,,
191,0.97,1340.338,1341.106,Exactly.,51,,
192,0.97,1341.106,1345.01,Okay.,52,,
193,0.97,1345.01,1371.436,"And then on the general engagement of cities and regional partners, how is Oir planning to engage the city council moving forward in defining those processes and identifying ways for Councilmembers to express their priorities and interests on behalf of their constituents?",52,,
194,0.97,1371.436,1372.037,Absolutely.,53,,
195,0.97,1372.037,1381.747,"We are still formulating that but initially, we are doing the scope of this information gathering and identification of projects and programs Departmentwide.",53,,
196,0.97,1381.747,1401.266,"We will summarize that and put it together in some briefing documents that I hope to share with Council for some feedback . If there are programs or things that you all have identified, to really bring that to our attention.",53,,
197,0.97,1401.266,1411.61,I hope to schedule future briefings with you all so we can walk through some of it but I think it will primarily happen off-line where we share some of the Prioritization lists and have some feedback and back and forth on those.,53,,
198,0.97,1411.61,1420.719,Definitely open to feedback or any sort of input you all have in the process as well.,53,,
199,0.97,1420.719,1423.221,Yeah.,54,,
200,0.97,1423.221,1444.943,"I do want to encourage Oir to engage the Council early on, as early as possible . as the appropriation arm of the Council, we also have legal responsibility and authority to approve grants as well.",54,,
201,0.97,1444.943,1455.52,"The departments are signaling interest in applying for grants, including in the public safety area.",54,,
202,0.97,1455.52,1496.895,"It would be in the best interest of the agency and the city as a whole to socialize those potential grant opportunities or grant applications with the chair responsible for the committee oversight of that Department and also with Whomever is going to be the next budget chair . I would really suggest coordinating that process with the next Council president and the next budget chair . in the past, we have run into situations where it has been largely led by the executive and Council has been briefed only after the ink has dried.",54,,
203,0.97,1496.895,1504.269,We have been in a situation where we did not agree with a particular grant because it indicated a policy direction.,54,,
204,0.97,1504.269,1516.381,"Those issues can be negotiated through early on, not for purposes of adding additional red tape but for creating opportunities of consensus and cooperation.",54,,
205,0.97,1516.381,1528.426,"I think that would be in the best interest of the people of the city and hopefully lend to a better, more productive, efficient process overall once we get to the end of this.",54,,
206,0.97,1528.426,1530.262,"I appreciate that input, thank you.",55,,
207,0.97,1530.262,1535.133,"Colleagues, any questions or comments?",56,,
208,0.97,1535.133,1536.935,"Councilmember Herbold, please.",56,,
209,0.97,1536.935,1542.641,Thank you for focusing on those really important process issues.,57,,
210,0.97,1542.641,1563.361,"I really concur with your observations about how we can, through that early engagement, strive for a more effective and efficient process with the branches of government more aligned . I really appreciate your saying so.",57,,
211,0.97,1563.361,1566.164,Just a couple of questions about the content of some of the programs here.,57,,
212,0.97,1566.164,1580.178,"The bridge grant program, I remember something coming up in the discussion around bridge bonding actions that Councilmember Pedersen sponsored successfully.",57,,
213,0.97,1580.178,1588.753,This question of whether or not projects need to be shovel ready or at a particular threshold to be eligible for the competitive bidding process.,57,,
214,0.97,1588.753,1595.26,"Can you speak to that? if not now, get back to us?",57,,
215,0.97,1595.26,1610.208,Is it so that projects need to be at a certain threshold of design to be considered eligible for the competitive grant process?,57,,
216,0.97,1610.208,1624.522,"If so, over how many years will applications for grants be available if you can help us learn more about that?",57,,
217,0.97,1624.522,1627.525,That would be helpful for us in the planning moving forward.,57,,
218,0.97,1627.525,1658.056,"Another question I have relates to slide 15 around the funds set aside for housing choice vouchers . is any of that funding geared--is any of the funding under that key housing provisions in the slide 15, is any of it geared toward addressing homelessness--I should say aside from the funds for housing choice vouchers.",57,,
219,0.97,1658.056,1670.168,Is it possible to get some more information about the $3 billion to establish the community restoration and reinvestment fund at HUD?,57,,
220,0.97,1670.168,1672.037,Just a little bit more information about the funds?,57,,
221,0.97,1672.037,1672.971,Thank you.,57,,
222,0.97,1672.971,1683.581,Great . Let me start on the bridge funding . We can take a quick look at exactly where the level of project readiness is.,58,,
223,0.97,1683.581,1690.288,"Let me say is a general theme, in terms of the conversations we have had so far with D.O.T.",58,,
224,0.97,1690.288,1709.574,", I think people are very much learning the lesson of Arra and this idea of shovel ready--that was possibly not the best metric for evaluating projects . that term that we keep hearing, for better or worse, is the project shovel worthy?",58,,
225,0.97,1709.574,1723.421,"I think when you are looking at shovel ready, not that there is anything wrong with filling hot bowls but if you are trying to make a longer term investment, shovel ready is not the greatest criteria.",58,,
226,0.97,1723.421,1731.93,I do think that there is a real effort on D.O.T .'s part to think about how you get these long-term important investments in.,58,,
227,0.97,1731.93,1740.905,"In terms of the exact specificity, Sierra and I can circle back with you on that.",58,,
228,0.97,1740.905,1751.249,"That funding is a combination of formula funding and competitive grants over five years . On homelessness, I can certainly circle back with more on the community reinvestment Fund.",58,,
229,0.97,1751.249,1756.554,This was something that President Biden had campaigned on.,58,,
230,0.97,1756.554,1768.933,It was a program with doing someplace based investment let us get to you with some of the specifics on that.,58,,
231,0.97,1768.933,1780.078,"In terms of homelessness, the housing choice voucher is really important there . Some of the investments in public housing are also anticipated to increase the fight on homelessness as well.",58,,
232,0.97,1780.078,1800.999,"One last question . I just noticed I forgot to ask . on the transit funding that is listed by three, is that a Pass- through based on a Federal formula or is it also competitive?",59,,
233,0.97,1800.999,1804.502,The transit funding is largely through the capital investment grant program which is a competitive program.,60,,
234,0.97,1804.502,1819.517,They have increased the threshold for small start from $300 Million- $400 million but that is funding for the capital investment grant project which is great news given that we have the pipeline.,60,,
235,0.97,1819.517,1822.72,It should be beneficial to us as well.,60,,
236,0.97,1822.72,1824.322,Thank you so much.,61,,
237,0.97,1824.322,1830.628,Appreciate it.,61,,
238,0.97,1830.628,1832.096,Thank you Councilmember Herbold for those questions.,62,,
239,0.97,1832.096,1838.136,"Colleagues, any other comments or questions for Leslie and Sierra?",62,,
240,0.97,1838.136,1843.041,Last opportunity.,63,,
241,0.97,1843.041,1843.441,All right.,63,,
242,0.97,1843.441,1849.948,No one has raised their hands.,63,,
243,0.97,1849.948,1855.053,Councilmember Mosqueda . I was wondering where you were.,63,,
244,0.97,1855.053,1856.054,I almost closed it out.,63,,
245,0.97,1856.054,1862.861,You are right on the nose to know that I love to weigh in on these conversations.,64,,
246,0.97,1862.861,1869.267,I want to say thank you as well to Leslie and Sierra and your entire team.,64,,
247,0.97,1869.267,1875.373,We want to think about our congressional delegations who have been tremendous.,64,,
248,0.97,1875.373,1883.681,"Senator Cantwell and Senator Murray, their entire teams have been great with trying to keep us informed.",64,,
249,0.97,1883.681,1903.635,"My biggest question is how can we help? really importantly, as we found out with implementation, how can we have more of a role in the Federal implantation work, especially when it comes to things like the infrastructure bill that has already passed and the work we hope to do with build back better?",64,,
250,0.97,1903.635,1909.107,Are the thoughts you have about strategy for getting involved in implementation at the Federal level?,64,,
251,0.97,1909.107,1912.911,That is a great question.,65,,
252,0.97,1912.911,1936.701,"Part of the process that Sierra is doing with the departments right now, in terms of understanding priority projects, understanding then how we would want the notice of funding opportunities that the Federal agencies will be releasing . What we want to do as much as possible is influence those notices of funding opportunity before they are released.",65,,
253,0.97,1936.701,1946.144,"Once we have our project priority list which we will work with you on, we want to get in front of Federal agencies to tell them what we are thinking about.",65,,
254,0.97,1946.144,1958.656,Seattle is seen as an expert on so many different issues from climate to affordable housing.,65,,
255,0.97,1958.656,1963.928,We want to share that expertise at the Federal level so that they are able to develop programs that benefit us.,65,,
256,0.97,1963.928,1974.272,Part of that is sharing the project early and meeting with them so we have a better understanding of what they are thinking as well but doing all of that in quarter one of next year.,65,,
257,0.97,1974.272,1975.873,I appreciate all of these conversations.,66,,
258,0.97,1975.873,1993.157,"With this unprecedented amount of funding and new funding opportunities that are coming out, this gives us a good opportunity to reset a little bit with council as far as Oir.",66,,
259,0.97,1993.157,1997.996,It has set the pace to really keep everybody in the Loop and have some regular communication beyond our sporadic briefings.,66,,
260,0.97,1997.996,2012.477,We are always available through Email and phone but I wanted to get in front of you all a little more regularly and stay more in step and engaged in this process.,66,,
261,0.97,2012.477,2019.984,One thing that was brought up was potentially to do with some regular budget committee briefings as we move through this process.,66,,
262,0.97,2019.984,2027.925,Happy to hear your ideas and any other input you have.,66,,
263,0.97,2027.925,2032.13,Definitely want to make some scheduled appearances and Coordinations.,66,,
264,0.97,2032.13,2033.197,Okay.,67,,
265,0.97,2033.197,2035.233,If I could just follow up.,67,,
266,0.97,2035.233,2038.403,Thank you so much.,67,,
267,0.97,2038.403,2042.407,Thank you for the updates and being involved early would be very helpful.,68,,
268,0.97,2042.407,2051.649,"I think a lot of us have national ties, whether it is to the National League of cities, what have you.",68,,
269,0.97,2051.649,2072.77,"We have a lot of interesting things to be involved in these early and given the implementation of some of our early Covid relief efforts and to see some of those dollars come to our city and want to be involved in the parameters that come with, that would be very helpful.",68,,
270,0.97,2072.77,2076.874,Please let us know . The Finance Committee does meet throughout the year.,68,,
271,0.97,2076.874,2088.853,The select budget committee does not but perhaps for 2022 the Finance Committee would be a good vehicle for that.,68,,
272,0.97,2088.853,2092.824,"Proactively, reach out to us and let us know if there are meetings you want us to jump into.",68,,
273,0.97,2092.824,2094.692,We will be happy to be there.,68,,
274,0.97,2094.692,2095.293,Perfect.,69,,
275,0.97,2095.293,2098.396,Thank you so much Councilmember Mosqueda.,70,,
276,0.97,2098.396,2119.717,"That process point is important . Sierra, I appreciate you offering opportunities to reset how we engage in the Federal work . Most of us have not necessarily had to do that because the last administration was so hostile that there was not productive opportunities for us to engage.",70,,
277,0.97,2119.717,2151.616,I think now that there is a real palpable difference and unique opportunities for individual Councilmembers to advocate on behalf of their district's . I think having an opportunity to model how we engage at the Federal level more similarly to how we engage at the state level during our legislative session could yield a lot of good results.,70,,
278,0.97,2151.616,2164.128,"Pre-Covid and right before I became Council President, I had had conversations with Oir about the potential of organizing Federal lobbying days for the Seattle city council.",70,,
279,0.97,2164.128,2212.31,"Unfortunately, Covid happened and we had to shelve those plans and engage more actively at the state level but I do think and hope that the Council will consider instituting similar to what we do at the state legislative level, an opportunity for us to more formally and in a more focused fashion engage with our Federal partners to advocate on behalf of our constituents . We will leave that as a suggestion for Oir and leadership on the Council side to consider in the future years here . I do think there is a lot of positive opportunities to engage with this administration that did not exist before.",70,,
280,0.97,2212.31,2217.815,"Colleagues, any other comments or questions?",71,,
281,0.97,2217.815,2219.483,I don't see any other hands raised.,71,,
282,0.97,2219.483,2219.917,"Thank you, Leslie.",71,,
283,0.97,2219.917,2226.891,"Thank you, Sierra for spending so much time with us this morning and for the initial Powerpoint presentation.",71,,
284,0.97,2226.891,2229.594,I look forward to getting the deeper dive briefing from all of you.,71,,
285,0.97,2229.594,2233.698,I am sure you will be hearing individually from the members of the Council.,71,,
286,0.97,2233.698,2243.007,Good luck to both of you on all of the important work that lays ahead.,71,,
287,0.97,2243.007,2243.841,You as well.,72,,
288,0.97,2243.841,2244.308,Appreciate your time.,72,,
289,0.97,2244.308,2244.842,Thank you.,73,,
290,0.97,2244.842,2245.443,Thank you.,74,,
291,0.97,2245.443,2246.043,Thank you.,75,,
292,0.97,2246.043,2249.313,We are going to move to the next item of business on the agenda.,76,,
293,0.97,2249.313,2262.393,I did want to note for the record that I did receive a note late from Councilmember Sawant's office that she will not be able to join us this morning.,76,,
294,0.97,2262.393,2265.029,I apologize for not catching that at the top of the agenda.,76,,
295,0.97,2265.029,2266.764,She is excused from today's Council briefing.,76,,
296,0.97,2266.764,2292.99,"Let's go ahead and move to agenda item 4 which is a preview of today's city council actions, Council and regional committee meetings . as a reminder, the roll call rotation order will begin with Councilmember Lewis and then we will head over to Councilmember Morales and then Mosqueda, Pedersen, Strauss, Herbold, Juarez and then I will conclude this portion of the agenda discussion.",76,,
297,0.97,2292.99,2294.158,"Councilmember Lewis, good morning.",76,,
298,0.97,2294.158,2298.429,Good morning Madam President.,77,,
299,0.97,2298.429,2308.406,Appreciate being here for our final meeting of 2021.,77,,
300,0.97,2308.406,2312.91,I have a couple of things that are on the agenda this afternoon so I will run through those really quickly.,77,,
301,0.97,2312.91,2314.712,The easy one first.,77,,
302,0.97,2314.712,2326.29,"Council bill 120239 coming out of the land use and neighborhoods Committee, cosponsored by Councilmember Strauss and myself.",77,,
303,0.97,2326.29,2353.918,"This is an amendment to Seattle's construction codes, filling a gap that was left from legislation in the spring, expanding the inclusion of electric water heaters in New commercial construction, something that has needed a little bit more work and a little bit more steak Bouldering prior to making official.",77,,
304,0.97,2353.918,2356.687,I will reserve more of my comments on that for final passage this afternoon.,77,,
305,0.97,2356.687,2367.765,I appreciate the extensive process this month that Councilmember Strauss committed to in committee including a full briefing as well as a subsequent Committee hearing last week for final passage in consideration of amendments.,77,,
306,0.97,2367.765,2379.744,One substantive change was made . We did include a date certain for when this will go into effect which will be April 1 of 2022.,77,,
307,0.97,2379.744,2398.229,"Really appreciate working with Councilmember Strauss on this and appreciate the significant contribution that this legislation will make toward reducing Co2 emissions . one of the biggest point sources, large commercial buildings.",77,,
308,0.97,2398.229,2402.9,Thank you Councilmember Strauss for your collaboration on this and I look forward to final passage this afternoon.,77,,
309,0.97,2402.9,2414.411,"I do also have Council bill 120247, cosponsored along with Council President Gonzalez.",77,,
310,0.97,2414.411,2447.945,This fairly Innocuous good government bill provides certain notice and transparency requirements in the Seattle municipal code on the reporting of simple baseline data to assist the Seattle city attorney's office and the Seattle city council in long- term strategic planning on how to address referrals to the city attorney's office and our criminal legal system here in the city of Seattle . I am very proud to bring this legislation forward.,77,,
311,0.97,2447.945,2472.036,"I know that there was an editorial in the Seattle times over the weekend, presumably an editorial relating to earlier ideas that had been raised around the possibility of an ordinance that would have created certain mandates in the Seattle city code, requiring the city attorney's office to engage in certain diversion practices.",77,,
312,0.97,2472.036,2488.052,"Our office, in close collaboration with the city attorney's office correctly determined that such an ordinance would have violated the Charter and unduly tied the hands of the city attorney's office in their full discretion and prosecutorial duties to manage the full litigation of the city.",77,,
313,0.97,2488.052,2502.399,"As somebody who used to work in the Seattle city attorney's office, I have immense respect for that Foundational Charter obligation and duty, as does this Council, as does Council President Gonzalez.",77,,
314,0.97,2502.399,2530.628,"Instead, we have brought in coordinates that will simply create a baseline of data and certain common sense notice requirements so the Seattle city council can effectively maintain our Charter obligation of oversight and Stewarding the resources of the city through the budget process which are things assigned to us under our charter obligations.",77,,
315,0.97,2530.628,2547.511,The Seattle times editorial this week seemed to apply that somehow providing basic data to the public was an undue burden on the city attorney's office.,77,,
316,0.97,2547.511,2564.361,"That might be the case if it was an unfunded mandate but as we have discussed, the Seattle city Council and our latest budget process did give four positions that the current city attorney did not have access to as it had not yet been created.",77,,
317,0.97,2564.361,2577.841,"The city attorney elect Davison will provide over the largest budget this Council is ever given to a city attorney, $38.5 million including new resources to facilitate the collection, aggregation and dissemination of data.",77,,
318,0.97,2577.841,2596.293,I have a hard time believing that the editorial board of a paper of record would oppose making more data available to the public so I am going to charitably assume that the editorial board must have been thinking of a bill that was ultimately not introduced.,77,,
319,0.97,2596.293,2600.998,I look forward to continuing those discussions if that is the case.,77,,
320,0.97,2600.998,2613.01,"If not, I do think that we have to have a serious conversation about whether a newspaper believes the public have a right to know what their government is doing.",77,,
321,0.97,2613.01,2616.78,I would imagine they do but I will reserve that for future conversations.,77,,
322,0.97,2616.78,2638.102,"I do want to touch on a couple of the other things that came up in the hearing last week, concerns that were valid areas for policy discussion from Councilmember Pedersen regarding whether using the s and C is an appropriate method.",77,,
323,0.97,2638.102,2660.958,"As everyone is aware, the Seattle city council does have various different mechanisms that our disposal in order to collect information and data from certain executive departments . Indeed, using the SMC is not our primary way of doing this but we do do it on a pretty frequent basis.",77,,
324,0.97,2660.958,2680.344,The best example for the city attorney's office is SMC 5.24020 which requires advanced notice of settlements in civil cases when they are above a certain amount of money in an executive session of this Council.,77,,
325,0.97,2680.344,2682.379,It is something that we engage in quite frequently.,77,,
326,0.97,2682.379,2697.795,"We are not in a position in those executive sessions to request that the city attorney's office, or to order that the city attorney's office do something different to resolve those cases.",77,,
327,0.97,2697.795,2729.927,"The city attorney's office retains the full discretion and supervision over legislation but it is important that the body that controls the budget for the city receive advanced notice of settlements that can have a potential impact on the overall financial position of the city . Similarly, we are establishing notice and data collection requirements here that are in that same vein . It is appropriate to do that through the SMC as a vehicle.",77,,
328,0.97,2729.927,2732.329,There are other reporting requirements on executive agencies throughout the municipal code.,77,,
329,0.97,2732.329,2774.371,"This is by no way an expansive collection of SMC but we do request reporting requirements and executive requirements under Smcs, SMC 11.11220, SMC 21.53025, SMC 14.12380, SMC 5.7 3.130, SMC 20.6 2.6. I could go on and on but I won't.",77,,
330,0.97,2774.371,2785.149,That would be a horrible use of the briefing but the point standing that we have plenty of codified reporting requirements.,77,,
331,0.97,2785.149,2792.89,I do want to cite my appreciation for the support of city attorney elect Davis and this legislation.,77,,
332,0.97,2792.89,2800.597,"In September 2021, she submitted a questionnaire.",77,,
333,0.97,2800.597,2823.52,"Question three reads, will you commit to tracking and reporting quarterly on a public facing Website demographics regarding race, Ethnicity, disabilities, age and other protective class demographics for decisions made by the office including charging decisions, diversion program programs and sentencing recommendations categorized by guilty pleas and conviction after trial?",77,,
334,0.97,2823.52,2848.946,"To this candid Davison indicated yes in the box next to that request . question four then reads, will you commit to tracking and reporting quarterly on a public facing Website Aggregated numbers of referrals by Seattle police Department precinct categorized by offense and capable of Cross- Referencing to the demographic data?",77,,
335,0.97,2848.946,2853.016,"Again, city attorney candidate Davison indicated yes in response to that question.",77,,
336,0.97,2853.016,2860.924,I don't know what has changed between September and December but I look forward to continuing to have discussions about how we can facilitate getting that information.,77,,
337,0.97,2860.924,2877.774,"This bill seems to accomplish that, especially when paired with the new resources this Council has given to the city attorney's office in order to send this data to us.",77,,
338,0.97,2877.774,2880.844,"With those considerations, I do hope that we can pass this legislation this afternoon.",77,,
339,0.97,2880.844,2901.965,I have not been made aware of substantive changes any members want to make though I will continue throughout this morning and this afternoon to accept proposals to do so and look forward to hearing from Stakeholders both internal and external to that effect.,77,,
340,0.97,2901.965,2906.803,"Otherwise, I look forward to considering that legislation and hope fully passing it this afternoon.",77,,
341,0.97,2906.803,2921.585,"I do hope that the collection of data can be done in a way where we are not unduly Politicizing transparency in city government . Otherwise, I don't have anything else to say on this legislation.",77,,
342,0.97,2921.585,2929.393,"This week, I do have one thing I want to share that I am really looking forward to.",77,,
343,0.97,2929.393,2943.206,On Thursday I will be attending a holiday celebration at the tiny House village in Interbay which was recently expanded as part of a collaboration between the city of Seattle and the port of Seattle.,77,,
344,0.97,2943.206,2955.152,I will be joined there by port of Seattle Commissioner Stephanie Bowman who worked extensively with me to double the size of this village that existed for several years at this location.,77,,
345,0.97,2955.152,2973.27,It was a very large port of Seattle owned property and Commissioner Bowman was incredibly helpful and energetic in making that space available so that the city could expand the tiny House village and except a couple dozen additional referrals.,77,,
346,0.97,2973.27,3007.604,"Councilmember Strauss, the ability to move folks from the Ballard Commons was Imminently related to this expansion and I do appreciate Councilmember Strauss acknowledging that, that this district 7 expansion was helpful in making sure that district 6 residents experiencing homelessness had a safe and secure place that they could live.",77,,
347,0.97,3007.604,3014.411,This is just an example of the kind of Collaborations we can have across the city as we invest and expand our tiny house system.,77,,
348,0.97,3014.411,3045.742,"I just wanted to highlight that I look forward to that holiday celebration, celebrating this new and expanded tiny House village and really showing how these interagency Collaborations, be at between the city of Seattle and sound transit, or between the city of Seattle and the port of Seattle in Interbay can really lead to moving forward on this issue that by far is the biggest issue facing the city, which is the crisis of homelessness.",77,,
349,0.97,3045.742,3050.847,"With that, Madam President, I don't have any additional comments . Thank you.",77,,
350,0.97,3050.847,3052.249,"Thank you so much, Councilmember Lewis.",78,,

454,0.97,4024.42,4029.125,"Good morning, colleagues.",86,,
455,0.97,4029.125,4042.538,There are no items directly from our transportation and utilities committee . We already adopted those items at the December 6 council meeting . Our transportation utilities committee meets on the first and third Wednesdays of each month.,86,,
456,0.97,4042.538,4049.812,"Our next committee meeting is this Wednesday, December 15 at 9:30 am . This will be our final committee meeting of the year.",86,,
457,0.97,4049.812,4054.216,We have a handful of items on the agenda which is already published Online.,86,,
458,0.97,4054.216,4068.33,"Regarding resolution 32029 that will update our city council rules and parliamentary procedures, the Governance committee indicated its interest in allowing the option at full Council of extensions on some types of resolutions.",86,,
459,0.97,4068.33,4076.439,They are consistence with the rules of order and are allowed in other cities of Washington state.,86,,
460,0.97,4076.439,4109.905,"Central staff had been work shopping a revised version for our consideration . I wanted to highlight a couple of proposed wage increase bills on our agenda today, 120242, 120243 and 120244, I believe.",86,,
461,0.97,4109.905,4121.784,"These bills reiterate, in my opinion, the ongoing challenge City Hall has in aligning the timing of Quantifying our growing personnel costs, which comprise the bulk of city government operating expenses with our fall budget review process.",86,,
462,0.97,4121.784,4131.894,We had already approved our fall budget and now we are being asked to approve over $30 million of higher costs for existing personnel.,86,,
463,0.97,4131.894,4149.044,"Apparently these funds were set aside in a reserves account but not clearly visible in the proposed budget . inflation is increasing rapidly with the increasing costs of goods and services Impacting all 700,000 residents in Seattle, especially the most vulnerable with low or no income.",86,,
464,0.97,4149.044,4160.623,"I agree, an increase cost of living for 12,000 government employees to try to keep pace with inflation would be ideal, whenever our city budget can afford it.",86,,
465,0.97,4160.623,4167.863,I want to thank city staff for further Quantifying the cost of this proposed legislation.,86,,
466,0.97,4167.863,4175.437,Apparently it is closer to $37 million then the $2 million as originally noted.,86,,
467,0.97,4175.437,4203.098,This includes $13 million increased for Non-Represented city government employees . This 4% wage increase is coming directly on the heels of a 2.9% cost-of-living increase from last year . My issue is not with the merits of these bills or the Hard-Working city government employees but rather with disjointed timing of this funding request from the executive coming after we have already approved the city budget.,86,,
468,0.97,4203.098,4231.226,"A few weeks ago we were told there was no more money for many needs we have such as the regional homelessness authority having requests for shelter beds . I am hoping that as we move forward, we can have this information, ideally around the same time, and make all of these decisions a Holistic matter so we can figure out how we are investing in our priorities together.",86,,
469,0.97,4231.226,4236.899,"I want to thank the Council president for her separate legislation, setting up the independent office of revenue Forecasing.",86,,
470,0.97,4236.899,4256.819,That we very important to get an independent view of revenues because that is a key piece of information . I am hoping the Harold administration is able to do more for regional authority for 2022.,86,,
471,0.97,4256.819,4271.433,"This past week, my staff attended the Magnuson park advisory committee monthly meeting which is comprised of community leaders, Nonprofits and city employees who care deeply about Magnuson park as a regional asset and home to 850 low income residents.",86,,
472,0.97,4271.433,4272.835,That concludes my report.,86,,

477,0.97,4284.647,4285.047,Thank you.,88,,
478,0.97,4285.047,4311.273,"I'm sorry, I did not quite catch the beginning of your concerns but I will let you know that the cost-of-living adjustments are something that is contemplated already in the budget . This is a line item that is sent down from the Mayor's office anticipating what the cost-of-living increase will be based on Awi and it is something that has been considered in the budget in front of us . I apologize that I did not have the chance to check in on this item.",88,,
479,0.97,4311.273,4313.909,I did not know this was an area of concern.,88,,
480,0.97,4313.909,4334.797,"Councilmember Pedersen, I am happy to try to make sure that we circulate a summary to the floor because my understanding is that this is something that has already been contemplated, fully balanced in our budget for 2022.",88,,
481,0.97,4334.797,4343.539,"General practice is part of the transparent conversation we have had, very much in alignment with the transparency requirements we have put on other items in the budget.",88,,
482,0.97,4343.539,4348.61,Happy to have that information circulated to the floor as well just to alleviate any concerns there.,88,,
483,0.97,4348.61,4351.847,Thank you.,89,,
484,0.97,4351.847,4413.675,"I am the sponsor of the bill Referenced by you, Councilmember Peterson . Our budgets every year due to plan and include and incorporate for projections related to our labor relations obligations . I think that the inference that we did not plan for it war were not aware of it, perhaps overlooks the process that does require heavy coordination between five members of the city Council and representatives of the executive including the city budget office director who is a member of the labor relations policy committee to coordinate closely the fiscal impacts as anticipated based on the back and forth nature of labor negotiations.",90,,
485,0.97,4413.675,4424.787,"Those labor negotiations often times go throughout the year, are hard to coordinate with our budget process . labor contracts are not tied specifically to city council budget appropriation processes.",90,,
486,0.97,4424.787,4475.971,"They are much more of a Give- And-Take flow throughout the year . as those contracts are approved based on our Good- faith engagement as highroad employers and the management side on those labor relations, we consider those collective bargaining agreements as they come out of that very thorough, sometimes extraordinarily long negotiation processes but in every event, we do work very closely with the city budget office to ensure that there will not be a shortfall, that there will not be a deficit and that there are enough dollars within the budgets that we have approved consistently every year that will cover the cost of those collective bargaining agreements.",90,,
487,0.97,4475.971,4491.386,"If there is a concern that this has resulted in a deficit, that is news to me and we will be following up with the budget chair and with our cancel central staff to get assurances that that is not the case.",90,,
488,0.97,4491.386,4491.787,Thank you.,90,,
489,0.97,4491.787,4496.692,Any other comments or questions on Council member Pedersen's report?,90,,

495,0.97,4513.509,4519.414,"Last week, the Ballard Commons park was closed after months of intensified outreach and engagement efforts to get residents of the park inside.",91,,
496,0.97,4519.414,4537.332,"Since the summer, I have worked to bring together a coalition of Evergreen treatment services which Ballard alliance, the Mayor's office, city deferments and service providers to coordinate a robust response to ensure the three essential pieces of successful encampment removal that took two and half months, rather than two and half days.",91,,
497,0.97,4537.332,4550.078,These successful elements are the relationships between outreach workers and people living in the park . the time to get people inside and the resources that match these people's needs.,91,,
498,0.97,4550.078,4562.557,"In August, we created a census of everyone living in the park in September we created a needs assessment to match people with them . Elter that was right for in October, we began moving people inside and continued moving people inside in November and December.",91,,
499,0.97,4562.557,4570.032,This is how we can remove an encampment without pushing people down the street or somewhere else in the neighborhood.,91,,
500,0.97,4570.032,4577.739,I want to take a special note to thank our city front-line workers and to James from reach who put themselves in difficult situations and who made this success possible.,91,,
501,0.97,4577.739,4602.297,The Park will be closed for six months to a year for remediation and installation of the children's playground closed in 2019 the city council funded this year .

503,0.97,4629.992,4641.303,"I want to thank all of the city partners, Ballard alliance, the Mayor's office, Seattle parks and recreation and all of the front-line workers who made this possible.",91,,
504,0.97,4641.303,4656.551,"My office has already begun working to bring a similar outcome to woodland park in green Lake and the success will be dependent on the three critical things . relationships, time, and shelter available and the partnerships that I know we already have.",91,,
505,0.97,4656.551,4664.86,I will be clear right here which is that shelter is not the answer to this homelessness crisis.,91,,
506,0.97,4664.86,4668.93,It will determine our success.,91,,
507,0.97,4668.93,4676.938,"For the first time, we have met our benchmark thanks to the leadership of budget chair Mosqueda to fund affordable housing.",91,,
508,0.97,4676.938,4680.542,This is a benchmark set in 2017.,91,,
509,0.97,4680.542,4682.177,This is the first time we have met it.,91,,
510,0.97,4682.177,4691.286,We do need to bring the adequate shelter Online so we can meet the crisis before us . Just building new shelter won't solve the problem.,91,,
511,0.97,4691.286,4705.3,We do need to have more throughput . I am just summarizing what has occurred this last week because of the investments city Council has made.,91,,
