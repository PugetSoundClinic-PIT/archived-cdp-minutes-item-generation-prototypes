164,0.97,1113.612,1113.946,Correct.,45,,
165,0.97,1113.946,1115.114,But the only concern I have.,45,,
166,0.97,1115.114,1116.815,I just want to follow up with you.,45,,
167,0.97,1116.815,1119.418,We seen some recent--I can't remember where I read it.,45,,
168,0.97,1119.418,1120.018,It was last week.,45,,
169,0.97,1120.018,1122.221,"I was wondering if we were looking at that, where I.C.E.",45,,
170,0.97,1122.221,1126.558,"Is no longer allowed to board buses, private Greyhound buses, any buses, and ask for people's identification, which they've been doing.",45,,
171,0.97,1126.558,1128.126,Is that something we can look into?,45,,
172,0.97,1128.126,1138.804,"I know that we have some jurisdictional issues that we have some priority in government areas, where the government can do certain things, but when it comes to private business and whether or not I.C.E.",45,,
173,0.97,1138.804,1144.243,"Agents can board private buses, just vehicles.",45,,
174,0.97,1144.243,1145.244,That's what they are doing.,45,,
175,0.97,1145.244,1157.623,"So, people who don't have cars, who are using the bus systems, I can't remember which city just banned that or if it's Federal.",45,,
176,0.97,1157.623,1159.258,I can look it up for you.,46,,
177,0.97,1159.258,1160.659,The session ends on the 14th.,47,,
178,0.97,1160.659,1161.46,The 12th.,48,,
179,0.97,1161.46,1164.062,We would have to move quickly to amend or expand it.,49,,
180,0.97,1164.062,1172.07,Happy to look into that and get back to you.,50,,
181,0.97,1172.304,1172.704,Good news today.,50,,
182,0.97,1172.704,1176.141,"I am going to turn it over to Quinn, who will review our transportation priorities today.",50,,
183,0.97,1176.141,1177.276,Thank you.,51,,
184,0.97,1177.276,1191.39,"So, starting with House bill 1793, and its companion Senate bill 5789, these are the automated enforcement for blocking the box and transit lanes legislation.",51,,
185,0.97,1191.39,1196.194,"The Senate, last Tuesday, past their version out of the full Senate prior to House of origin'.",51,,
186,0.97,1196.194,1197.896,This is a really positive step forward.,51,,
187,0.97,1197.896,1199.064,The Senate had a Hangup last year.,51,,
188,0.97,1199.064,1201.066,Both the house and Senate versions are still alive.,51,,
189,0.97,1201.066,1202.935,"The Senate is hearing the House version today, this afternoon.",51,,
190,0.97,1202.935,1206.972,The House is hearing the Senate version on Saturday.,51,,
191,0.97,1206.972,1219.318,"We are focusing on keeping both bills alive, it's really trying to move the Senate version forward, since it's in a form that's already agreed to by all of the Stakeholders.",51,,
192,0.97,1219.318,1229.728,"As we mentioned previously, chief Scoggins, chief best, and all of the Stakeholders have done tremendous work moving this forward, and I think we are in a good position on that legislation.",51,,
193,0.97,1229.728,1240.038,Thank you again for the opportunity to testify previously in front of the Senate.,52,,
194,0.97,1240.038,1241.907,I would be happy to join you again this Saturday.,52,,
195,0.97,1241.907,1244.543,"Wonderful, thank you.",53,,
196,0.97,1244.543,1248.08,"Moving onto House bill 2362 and a companion 6652, this is the local transportation revenue options.",53,,
197,0.97,1248.08,1255.721,These bills did not pass the respective houses before cut off.,53,,
198,0.97,1255.721,1256.521,This is not a surprise.,53,,
199,0.97,1256.521,1264.262,"As I've mentioned previously, both house and Senate chairs the local transportation revenue options as part of a broader conversation on a potential statewide transportation revenue package.",53,,
200,0.97,1264.262,1271.57,That's likely to move forward next legislative session.,53,,
201,0.97,1271.57,1277.843,"While it was important to start the conversation on these issues this year, I think we will be doing the real work next legislative session on that.",53,,
202,0.97,1277.843,1284.783,A final update on House bill 66--Zarco Senate bill 6606.,53,,
203,0.97,1284.783,1295.727,This is the regional transit authorities.,53,,
204,0.97,1295.727,1298.463,This is the legislation that would change the cartel valuation schedule for sound transit.,53,,
205,0.97,1298.463,1307.806,"The primary update is, although this bill did not pass before House of origin cut off, it's being considered necessary to implement the budget, and is therefore going to be in play until the end of session.",53,,
206,0.97,1307.806,1312.611,"It would still require a two thirds vote, and it's not clear if there is a path forward, but the negotiations are ongoing.",53,,
207,0.97,1312.611,1315.681,Is this the one where it was just a Scrivener's error?,54,,
208,0.97,1315.681,1321.92,No.,55,,
209,0.97,1321.92,1339.404,"This legislation would shift sound transit's car valuation schedule from the 96 to 2006 schedule, and it would also maintain the current 1.1% rate that was repealed by initiative 976, which is why it would require two thirds because it it Mends within two years.",55,,
210,0.97,1339.404,1341.239,This would be a substantive policy change.,55,,
211,0.97,1341.239,1344.042,Any questions?,56,,
212,0.97,1344.042,1353.418,"Moving on, I think we wanted to take the new progressive revenue bill towards the end.",57,,
213,0.97,1353.418,1359.324,We have compiled many questions from you all.,57,,
214,0.97,1359.324,1361.159,I think Robin is going to go through those.,57,,
215,0.97,1361.159,1363.962,"We haven't answered all of them at this stage, so that work is ongoing.",57,,
216,0.97,1363.962,1365.53,We will review what we know now.,57,,
217,0.97,1365.53,1370.302,"I would be happy to take additional questions, but I can go through my list if that's okay with everyone.",58,,
218,0.97,1389.521,1395.06,"The first question is, can we have a break down of the spending plan in rough dollars and percentages divided out by discretionary and mandatory funding?",59,,
219,0.97,1395.06,1399.765,"As I understand the current version of the bill, the idea is to have the spending plans be done at the county level.",59,,
220,0.97,1399.765,1404.269,"This legislation done at the state level is very broad, and gives the county the authority to levy this tax.",59,,
221,0.97,1404.269,1408.573,"What, if any, explicit or implicit limitations either on city revenue authority, and how broad are any of those limitations?",59,,
222,0.97,1408.573,1409.941,"At this point, there are no limits.",59,,
223,0.97,1409.941,1412.244,There is no Preemption clause in the current version of the bill.,59,,
224,0.97,1412.244,1419.05,"In section 8 of the bill, .1 added on the .2 authority.",59,,
225,0.97,1419.05,1422.621,What is the vehicle through which we are collecting those dollars and how will they be distributed?,59,,
226,0.97,1422.621,1434.232,"My understanding of the current version of the bill, and I think the language is confusing, is that it's a total .25% with .1% going to the largest cities in the county, including Seattle.",59,,
227,0.97,1434.232,1447.045,"That money, as I understand it, would come directly to Seattle, and the sale Council, and Mayor would have discretion over how to spend that money within the broad categories of the authority of this bill.",59,,
228,0.97,1447.045,1461.46,I guess the collection method is through the existing record to collect taxes that the office of the financial and administrative services operates.,59,,
229,0.97,1461.46,1465.13,So that would be collected at the city level?,60,,
230,0.97,1465.13,1469.568,I am actually not sure about that.,61,,
231,0.97,1469.568,1471.97,I would kind of leave that to Benjamin noble.,61,,
232,0.97,1471.97,1488.186,"We can follow up and get you more details on that because I do understand that they understand some of the changes would need to be made to make this happen, especially if there was a city allocation and county allocation.",61,,
233,0.97,1488.186,1489.955,It just complement things.,61,,
234,0.97,1489.955,1492.691,There's an amount of time it takes to set up the system.,62,,
235,0.97,1492.691,1515.513,"We were told when we were Deliberating the Employable hours tax, which was primed to phase into a payroll tax after CBO had the opportunity to set up a payroll tax recovery system.",62,,
236,0.97,1515.513,1524.022,"The reason we had to do a phase, because no one wanted the employee hours, but the reason why we started with employee hours, is because it was going to take about a year to create a system for the payroll tax.",62,,
237,0.97,1524.022,1527.926,I think that's important for us to know.,62,,
238,0.97,1527.926,1538.036,"Who's doing it, and how much time they anticipate it will take to set up.",62,,
239,0.97,1538.036,1542.407,I understand this is for the COMP located because portions of the money are allocated on the population of the various jurisdictions.,62,,
240,0.97,1542.407,1551.917,Certain parts are by how much of the tax is generated in the jurisdiction.,62,,
241,0.97,1551.917,1552.717,Certainly has two different ways.,62,,
242,0.97,1552.717,1555.12,"It's not straight across the board, one talk elation.",62,,
243,0.97,1555.12,1566.464,Can I ask you to go back to the first question?,63,,
244,0.97,1566.464,1571.77,"On the spending allocation, can you repeat what the answer was, whether there was a directive on how much spending and, which categories, which percentages?",63,,
245,0.97,1571.77,1581.279,"The only directive that is in the Bell bill now is housing and homelessness, behavioral health, public safety.",64,,
246,0.97,1581.279,1584.382,It doesn't get into the Nitty- gritty details of exactly how the money must be spent.,64,,
247,0.97,1584.382,1587.018,"There is deceptively, which about shelter, permanent supportive housing, things like that.",64,,
248,0.97,1587.018,1591.69,It will be up to the county and city to determine that spending plan.,64,,
249,0.97,1591.69,1592.59,Thank you.,65,,
250,0.97,1592.59,1597.596,I have a follow up question.,65,,
251,0.97,1597.596,1608.773,The public safety problem that has been introduced into this conversation after the sound city became part of a player at the negotiating table.,65,,
252,0.97,1608.773,1611.609,I am just kind of curious how broad the public safety definition is.,65,,
253,0.97,1611.609,1624.689,"And whether money raised from this taxing authority could potentially, in some jurisdictions were in the city of Seattle be spent on police and fire, or if it has to be more narrowly tailored.",65,,
254,0.97,1624.689,1644.309,It is more narrowly tailored and directed towards services that people with behavioral health issues and experiencing homelessness come into contact with the criminal justice system may need to keep them from interacting with that system over and over again.,66,,
255,0.97,1644.309,1655.453,I understand it's quite important to one of the prime sponsors of the bill.,66,,
256,0.97,1655.453,1657.522,To assist people who are interacting with the criminal justice system.,66,,
257,0.97,1657.522,1678.443,"Would it be more accurate to describe that as a diversion funding Prong? I think that's been confusing to a lot of my constituents, and a lot of people who think this might be a secret clause to fund law and order type programs.",67,,
258,0.97,1678.443,1683.515,I think a diversion is an excellent way to think about that proposal.,68,,
259,0.97,1695.427,1698.963,It would be helpful for us to have a better sense of where those dollars would go.,69,,
260,0.97,1698.963,1712.277,"For example, facilities, public safety services, how this will be echoed ably distributed across the city and County, so people don't even make an assumption that it will go into additional policing, or that it will be more directive that this is for services in the public safety realm, versus the latter.",69,,
261,0.97,1712.277,1725.924,"Also, it would be extremely helpful if we had a better sense of how our priorities potentially will be represented in the final bill as it comes to spending allocation.",69,,
262,0.97,1725.924,1744.909,"As it relates to spending allocation in the second, the Council was really specific about a desire to see a large portion, at least half of the dollars going into housing with the majority going into the 0% to 30% regional housing.",69,,
263,0.97,1744.909,1753.151,"As it relates to enhanced shelters services, specifically evidenced based services.",69,,
264,0.97,1753.151,1787.418,"Happy to chat more if and when those details are forthcoming, but my desire, and I think the strong message from Council was as the bill is finalized, we would like her to be that directive in statute, so it's very clear to the county and the incorporated city's that this is truly about housing, Evidence-Based strategies for homelessness, behavioral health services, and to Lynn Lewis's point, housing services.",69,,
265,0.97,1787.418,1788.887,I have a follow up to that.,70,,
266,0.97,1788.887,1796.261,I want to underscore what Councilmember Mosqueda just said.,70,,
267,0.97,1796.261,1808.807,"One of the criticisms and concerns I've had is that 80% was going towards shelter and 20% was still uncertain, in my opinion.",70,,
268,0.97,1808.807,1824.689,"My position has always been that, if we are going to tax and move forward to shelter the unsheltered and look at homelessness, and behavioral health issues, that a majority that are clearing the call here is that it goes to sheltering the unsheltered, and the services are provided, not to public safety.",70,,
269,0.97,1824.689,1843.541,"I understand there was a big push for intervention programs, and I understand that, but again, it took us a lot of time, effort, and political will, and capital to get it from the regional policy Council across the street over here to get it passed.",70,,
270,0.97,1843.541,1846.01,The long history it took.,70,,
271,0.97,1846.01,1860.825,"I just want to make sure that we are clear on our Northstar, that the reason we are dealing with a sound city people, which is fine, but to ensure two things that we kept pushing.",70,,
272,0.97,1860.825,1867.532,"We did this with the Opioid issue, as well.",70,,
273,0.97,1867.532,1873.638,"Not all of the difficult things that go on in our County are in the city of Seattle, that homelessness, addiction, behavioral health issues come from everywhere.",70,,
274,0.97,1873.638,1884.382,The regional approach is what has been our rallying point to get these other cities on board to have this regional response.,70,,
275,0.97,1884.382,1910.808,"I am hoping when I'm done with this job, after this, we continue to have a regional response to these kind of issues, whether it's public health, public safety, housing, that we are not held by the tyranny of the minority, when we start seeing those ordinances passed about, we don't want safe injection sites.",70,,
276,0.97,1910.808,1912.01,You don't get to do that.,70,,
277,0.97,1912.01,1915.48,The board of health makes those decisions because it's a county issue that affects all of us.,70,,
278,0.97,1915.48,1926.624,"I am on a Soapbox here, but what I'm trying to say is what Councilmember Mosqueda said.",70,,
279,0.97,1926.624,1930.361,"We want to be true to our word, not only to constituents and residents, but all of King County.",70,,
280,0.97,1930.361,1935.266,"We want to look at sheltering the unsheltered and having these homes, and all of these programs built, so we can do that.",70,,
281,0.97,1935.266,1937.035,Did you want to follow up?,71,,
282,0.97,1937.035,1941.239,If I may.,72,,
283,0.97,1941.239,1947.612,"I think that's a great example for the safe consumption sites, but I want to be clear for the viewing audience, this bill has nothing to do with safe consumption sites.",72,,
284,0.97,1947.612,1956.154,"This is all about housing and shelter services, so just before anybody thinks that's the case, it is absolutely not.",72,,
285,0.97,1956.154,1959.958,I know there is confusion from some in the other Chamber.,72,,
286,0.97,1959.958,1962.36,That's my fault because I used the same example again.,73,,
287,0.97,1962.36,1962.727,I apologize.,73,,
288,0.97,1962.727,1986.351,"Very quickly, I think a good, specific request to the President pro Tem's point about equitable distribution is section nine be subsection 2, it would be helpful to have a definition of what equitably cited means.",74,,
289,0.97,1986.351,1990.955,"If we are talking about sources across the region, it would be helpful to have the clarification of legislative attempt intent.",74,,
290,0.97,1990.955,1993.858,You want the definition of what could be equitably cited?,75,,
291,0.97,1993.858,1999.163,Yes.,76,,
292,0.97,1999.163,2007.572,"Under public safety, local areas can spend money on facilities as long as they are equitably cited, so that's what gets back to the question Councilmember Lewis asked.",76,,
293,0.97,2007.572,2014.212,Juan Morales.,77,,
294,0.97,2014.212,2018.216,I want to ask more technical questions.,78,,
295,0.97,2018.216,2040.204,"I want to understand if there's any conversation about understanding that freight because, as we all know, this would raise a fraction of what we actually need to begin to address the problem if we are talking about this bill being a homelessness tool for addressing our homelessness crisis, and housing issue.",78,,
296,0.97,2040.204,2043.04,My read of the latest version is it RAISES a little bit more.,78,,
297,0.97,2043.04,2050.381,"It's intended to raise more than the first version, but that our allocation would still be a fraction of what we need, maybe $50 million.",78,,
298,0.97,2050.381,2050.948,That's one question.,78,,
299,0.97,2050.948,2062.126,The other thing is I don't have a clear understanding of what their conversations at the county are like.,78,,
300,0.97,2062.126,2073.07,"If the county is prepared to accept this authority, if there's any conversation at the county Council level about how they would plan to implement this.",78,,
301,0.97,2073.07,2074.338,"Maybe, you can address that, as well.",78,,
302,0.97,2074.338,2074.739,Sure.,79,,
303,0.97,2074.739,2082.48,"It's my understanding there are active conversations ongoing about raising the rates to a higher level, and trying to come to a negotiated solution on that.",79,,
304,0.97,2082.48,2103.601,"It is also my understanding that there are active conversations with the county Councilmembers happening, and the lobbyist is engaged in the conversations in Olympia, and is similar to what I'm doing, providing information back and forth because ultimately, they would have to enact the tax at the county level.",79,,
305,0.97,2103.601,2106.904,Having them on board is important.,79,,
306,0.97,2106.904,2107.405,Thank you.,80,,
307,0.97,2107.405,2129.627,"What would be helpful, I think to all of us, is in reading the bill, you really need to transfer everything to a spreadsheet to understand how much money we are getting, so can we get a spreadsheet that translates how much is starting?",80,,
308,0.97,2129.627,2131.229,Budget has started on something along those lines.,81,,
309,0.97,2131.229,2133.631,What's the payroll tax number we are multiplying these numbers to?,82,,
310,0.97,2133.631,2144.809,"This particular bill is more complicated because it has the point 10, and the .25, so my rough calculations, there's more like $75 million, but I think we need a spreadsheet, so I think we're all on the same page.",82,,
311,0.97,2144.809,2148.246,Finance can plan and determine how much this is to Seattle.,82,,
312,0.97,2148.246,2148.679,Certainly.,83,,
313,0.97,2148.679,2154.152,I understand it's a moving target with different versions of the bill.,83,,
314,0.97,2154.152,2155.152,"20% of this, 30% of that.",83,,
315,0.97,2155.152,2165.329,"It's confusing and I know the budget office has started that at our request, so we will be happy to provide that to you.",83,,
316,0.97,2165.329,2168.266,I believe we have a clarifying call with the budget office later today.,84,,
317,0.97,2168.266,2169.367,We should have more soon.,84,,
318,0.97,2169.367,2174.639,I was under the impression that we had been talking about the question that this table.,85,,
319,0.97,2174.639,2184.482,"That mix me wonder whether it has gotten into this version of the bill, that there would be a percentage that could only be used for permanent supportive housing.",85,,
320,0.97,2184.482,2185.182,Is that Martin the bill?,85,,
321,0.97,2185.182,2214.278,"I believe the current version of the bill, and I will double check this for you, says 50% of the money, of the 60% that goes to affordable housing, of which Seattle gets 45%, but 50% of that entire bucket, just Cialis plus portion, should be used for people earning under 30% of area median income.",86,,
322,0.97,2214.278,2216.914,"Okay, but there is also--maybe I didn't ask the right way.",87,,
323,0.97,2216.914,2220.518,"You very hopefully answered the question I asked, which is about permanent housing.",87,,
324,0.97,2220.518,2224.722,That's 30% and under.,87,,
325,0.97,2224.722,2228.492,What is the percentage of the total amount used for housing?,87,,
326,0.97,2228.492,2230.695,60% directly to housing.,88,,
327,0.97,2230.695,2236.233,And half of that for under 30% AMI?,89,,
328,0.97,2236.233,2236.734,Correct.,90,,
329,0.97,2236.734,2237.835,Exactly.,90,,
330,0.97,2237.835,2240.438,It's a very confusing way to get there.,90,,
331,0.97,2240.438,2245.343,The way you just said it is better.,91,,
332,0.97,2245.343,2250.414,I guess I could go back to my questions.,92,,
333,0.97,2250.414,2252.25,We are scheduled until 10 deck 15.,93,,
334,0.97,2252.25,2252.717,Okay.,94,,
335,0.97,2252.717,2254.051,Terrific.,94,,
336,0.97,2254.051,2268.466,"I think I just answered this question, but there is a question on what Subregion is Seattle and because the bill talks about Subregions.",94,,
337,0.97,2268.466,2274.772,"Seattle is a phone, and then there is two other Subregions that would be the North and East, and on the South area of the county.",94,,
338,0.97,2274.772,2283.948,We are our own region all on our own from the current version of the bill that I understand.,94,,
339,0.97,2283.948,2292.49,"What intersections is this bill intended to have with of the regional homelessness authority, specifically how will the advisory committee work to coordinate?",94,,
340,0.97,2292.49,2297.762,"I think to some extent, that would be decided, again, at a spending plan at the county level, but I do understand there is some intent.",94,,
341,0.97,2297.762,2308.906,"The city has an Interlocal agreement with the regional homelessness authority, so that we could, obviously put some of the money toward the regional homelessness authority.",94,,
342,0.97,2308.906,2331.495,"I think there has also been a conversation around retaining some authority for us at the city, in case we wanted to use funds around homelessness for a specific use, so I do think that is all things that would be decided at the local level, and but don't go into the detail of the state legislation, at this time.",94,,
343,0.97,2331.495,2333.531,What is the intention behind the ability to supplant funds?,94,,
344,0.97,2333.531,2355.653,"I understand it's important to the business community in particular, in some of the conversations that this not be used to provide funding for existing programs, but that it's used to build new housing, create new shelter, and create new behavioral health facilities, and services, so that we are not Backfilling current budget.",94,,
345,0.97,2355.653,2357.488,That's why the language is in the bill.,94,,
346,0.97,2366.964,2367.898,Should this exemption be expanded?,94,,
347,0.97,2367.898,2375.773,"I am concerned that the 50 employee threshold might be too low, and the $3 million threshold is too low because it's gross revenues instead of net.",94,,
348,0.97,2375.773,2377.775,I understand this part of the bill is still under discussion.,94,,
349,0.97,2377.775,2380.544,I think that is a policy decision for interaction with the state legislators.,94,,
350,0.97,2380.544,2390.221,"I do know that small businesses have been in conversation with legislators, so I do understand that's been happening.",94,,
351,0.97,2394.992,2398.696,"Section 3. why are there exceptions for motor vehicle and fuel, and liquor?",94,,
352,0.97,2398.696,2405.87,"As I understand it, is our existing state laws that make it a requirement that, that happened.",94,,
353,0.97,2405.87,2420.618,"We can certainly provide you with additional information on that, and what Cw it is, and things like that, but it's my understanding that is the way it has to be under existing state law.",94,,
354,0.97,2420.618,2425.623,The bill defines affordable housing as only income restricted.,94,,
355,0.97,2425.623,2426.524,This is a long question.,94,,
356,0.97,2426.524,2427.725,I am going to summarize it.,94,,
357,0.97,2427.725,2439.336,"Essentially, it is trying to get at why are we only saying it needs to soar below 80% of AMI?",94,,
358,0.97,2439.336,2442.406,"Wouldn't we want to rent restrict, so people might be cost burdened by paying their rent?",94,,
359,0.97,2442.406,2452.783,I think that's the overall intent Justlike other affordable housing with income and French restriction.,94,,
360,0.97,2452.783,2478.976,"I think in all likelihood in Seattle, the funds would be blended with our other sources of funding, like mandatory housing authority, and the Seattle housing levy cost which is restricted to 60% of median income, so there's homeownership opportunities, potentially at 80%, although I don't know if that money would be here, but the funding we normally do would necessarily income restrict the funds at a lower level.",94,,
361,0.97,2483.514,2501.031,"I think the next question is about the exact allocation of funds, and rather than do some quick math on the back of a napkin I will get that to you.",94,,
362,0.97,2503.367,2505.369,Can the reference to shelters be changed to enhance shelters?,94,,
363,0.97,2505.369,2509.406,We should not be expanding math on the floor model without case management because it doesn't have Highness success outcomes.,94,,
364,0.97,2509.406,2511.675,I think we can certainly advance that as a priority.,94,,
365,0.97,2511.675,2538.035,"One of the things I've been hearing from the city, the other cities, the suburban cities, as they feel like they need lots of flexibility, and their needs are very different from Seattle needs, so I think all of these policy decisions in this bill are trying to walk a line where we are making sure we are meeting the needs of all of the Stakeholders, so I think that's probably a conversation around back.",94,,
366,0.97,2538.035,2541.105,"Certainly, it would Behoove us to add enhanced shelters to the list of things.",94,,
367,0.97,2541.105,2546.744,But may I clarify?,94,,
368,0.97,2546.744,2566.664,"Not only is it a cost savings to do that, we know it also helps the people into housing when they have enhanced shelter Úat a rate of four or five time of that of folks on the floor, so if this is a Finance bill, it makes financial sense for us to really ensure that these dollars are going to enhance shelter.",94,,
369,0.97,2566.664,2573.37,We have the conversation about Evidence-Based strategies.,94,,
370,0.97,2573.37,2585.316,"I know we were talking about regional authority, and our desire to see Evidence-Based strategies in the creation of the regional homelessness authority.",94,,
371,0.97,2585.316,2604.868,"I understand that language wasn't included, so I think it's really important that we emphasize the Evidence-Based strategies and models because we don't want folks throwing money at the wall when we know what works, especially when folks are dying without these services.",94,,
372,0.97,2604.868,2606.103,Thank you for taking that back.,94,,
373,0.97,2606.103,2610.174,"I want to confirm at this point, does the bill say Evidence-Based strategies still in it, or is it silent?",94,,
374,0.97,2610.174,2612.409,"I'm not sure, but I will check on that.",95,,
375,0.97,2612.409,2615.479,"I feel like I should know that, even though I've read it a few times.",95,,
376,0.97,2615.479,2617.281,I will double check and get back to you.,95,,
377,0.97,2617.281,2629.693,"I will also bring forward the point that you feel strongly that Evidence-Based strategies should be included, and we should make sure we are focusing on enhanced shelter.",95,,
378,0.97,2629.693,2630.461,Thank you.,96,,
379,0.97,2635.766,2647.144,There's a public safety question I've already answered with some of the other questions.,97,,
380,0.97,2647.144,2648.879,How is the .1% to Seattle constrained?,97,,
381,0.97,2648.879,2652.616,"It appears to be constrained to 60% for housing, 25% for public safety, and 15% for behavioral health services.",97,,
382,0.97,2652.616,2667.865,"I believe, as it is, it would be outside of the housing realm at that .1%, that I need to double check because I do think the way the bill is written, it's a little bit confusing.",97,,
383,0.97,2667.865,2680.044,"I think with all of these different percentages and moving pieces, certain things have gotten taken from one version of the bill and put into another.",97,,
384,0.97,2680.044,2684.681,"When you change the percentage, it doesn't work as well, so it's not surprising that there is some confusion around that.",97,,
385,0.97,2684.681,2694.458,"I will get that from Benjamin noble, how that works exactly, and others of the budget office, so you all can understand that.",97,,
386,0.97,2694.458,2695.092,The same thing.,97,,
387,0.97,2695.092,2697.695,"There is a question about, is there a redundant, or copy paste Typo.",97,,
388,0.97,2697.695,2700.531,I think that may be the case with some language in the bill.,97,,
389,0.97,2709.84,2712.509,Is a technical question imposed on ordinance for one or more subsequent periods.,97,,
390,0.97,2712.509,2716.814,"Maybe, reimposed by county ordinance for one or more subsequent periods to make sure the governing body is clear in the language.",97,,
391,0.97,2716.814,2731.028,"As Lily said, I think our budget office is having a phone call with staff, you know?",97,,
392,0.97,2731.028,2734.298,"Staff in Olympia, moving at an incredibly fast pace, and being asked to change things.",97,,
393,0.97,2734.298,2739.803,"This is not the only build on the, despite how important it is.",97,,
394,0.97,2739.803,2741.205,There is a lot of pressure.,97,,
395,0.97,2741.205,2755.819,"Budget staff did have questions about technical issues, about how things would operate, about language that needs to be included to make sure there's Functionality to make this policy come to fruition at the local level, so we are convening that call today, to start the conversation and make sure the bill is technically correct.",97,,
396,0.97,2773.203,2776.14,I am curious about the exemption due to extreme financial hardship for an employer.,97,,
397,0.97,2776.14,2778.675,I think there will be an effort to further define extreme financial hardship.,97,,
398,0.97,2778.675,2782.679,I think that is just meant in the case of a business that may be experiencing any type of issues.,97,,
399,0.97,2782.679,2789.486,"Bankruptcy, or something else, that they may be able to get an exemption for the taxes for a limited period of time, if it was going to be, somehow, make their business worse off.",97,,
400,0.97,2789.486,2791.755,I think it is meant to be quite a tight definition.,97,,
401,0.97,2791.755,2797.461,"With that, I think--is there anything else you guys want to add?",98,,
402,0.97,2797.461,2799.496,I don't think so unless there are more questions.,99,,
403,0.97,2799.496,2801.098,I just want to say thank you.,100,,
404,0.97,2801.098,2809.406,I know folks at the Intergovernmental relations office received about six questions initially.,100,,
405,0.97,2809.406,2813.477,"We now have about 16 questions, so thankful for walking through those.",100,,
406,0.97,2813.477,2816.713,We will provide you with the full list of those questions if Robin was responding to.,100,,
407,0.97,2816.713,2825.088,"Thank you because I know many of these questions, the answers have varied depending on the drafts that you looked at.",100,,
408,0.97,2825.088,2847.611,"Happy to have additional information as you expected . I just want to say thank you for fielding those questions, and doing so this morning because we know it is all being thrown at you very fast, but I appreciate your representation of where the Council is at, especially around Preemption in Olympia.",100,,
409,0.97,2847.611,2867.364,"We know many people have been asking for Preemption in the spill, and I think that, to Councilmember Mariah Ellis' point, this is a down payment to an incredibly challenging situation, a crisis, a state of emergency for the last three years, so every dollar we can bring in will be appreciated.",100,,
410,0.97,2867.364,2876.273,"I saw representative Macri at her town hall, along with her colleagues, in 43rd, and I applaud her for her steadfast leadership in this.",100,,
411,0.97,2876.273,2893.69,"It's truly is because our friends are there saying we Úneed to have the floor raised, but also don't want to limit the ability for us to think about creative solutions in the future.",100,,
412,0.97,2893.69,2894.591,It's just good Governance.,100,,
413,0.97,2894.591,2899.83,"I really applaud her for her steadfast leadership, and you guys for helping Sheppard our Council priorities in Olympia, and for answering those questions quickly.",100,,
414,0.97,2899.83,2902.666,I appreciate it.,100,,
415,0.97,2902.666,2903.467,Think you.,101,,

426,0.97,2972.936,2974.638,It's an important year for the parks district.,101,,
427,0.97,2974.638,2997.694,"And actually is very critical because when the voters passed the metropolitan park district 2014, there was a six-year plan, and it was very clear leadership about the six-year plan, what we were going to spend on operation coming in, and programming, so now it's coming up, so there is a lot of money there for different projects, and I'm looking at it with an eye toward the District and across the city.",101,,

431,0.97,3033.897,3050.947,"With the six-year program coming up, this is a good time for us to start having conversations about what the programming should look like, and make sure I am transmitting met, and working with the executive on that.",101,,
