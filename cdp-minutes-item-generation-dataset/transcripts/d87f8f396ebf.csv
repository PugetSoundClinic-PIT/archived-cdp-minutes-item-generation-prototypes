100,0.97,595.761,610.81,At our August 10 meeting we had an in depth meeting and discussion with Council central staff and also the office of economic development on the bill in the draft form.,20,,
101,0.97,610.81,624.423,"I spoke with a major driver of economic development in the creative economy, as well as in Seattle's economy as a whole, because so many of the skills required in film are used in other sectors.",20,,
102,0.97,624.423,625.458,Those are living wage jobs.,20,,
103,0.97,625.458,630.096,I also laid out the long history of advocacy for a film Commission.,20,,
104,0.97,630.096,648.614,"And most recently that was with the creation of, driven by largely--I have to extend appreciation to my colleagues--Councilmember Herbold and Morales and Sawant.",20,,
105,0.97,648.614,654.553,There was a film task force formed in 2019 and they represented a broad Cross- section.,20,,
106,0.97,654.553,658.29,"In fact, every segment of the film industry.",20,,
107,0.97,658.29,672.371,"These diverse members had their primary concern as a diversity of race, age, and gender in the film industry and how to advance that three film Commission.",20,,
108,0.97,672.371,680.579,They produced a report in 2020 and this legislation is based on those recommendations.,20,,
109,0.97,680.579,685.184,"So, last weekend was the ninth annual Seattle film summit.",20,,
110,0.97,685.184,695.061,"In case you have never been, that is a gathering of creative's and Nonprofits, labor, policymakers, educational institution.",20,,
111,0.97,695.061,708.507,"Like shoreline community college, Cornish, and even the International stunt school, which is based in Everett and is world-famous.",20,,
112,0.97,708.507,709.241,Who knew?,20,,
113,0.97,709.241,711.143,I didn't.,20,,
114,0.97,711.143,711.744,But now I do.,20,,
115,0.97,711.744,732.898,"I was invited to be a keynote Speaker to talk about establishing a film Commission in Seattle and after my talk, the Commissioner of the film office, the film office Commissioner, came up to me and she looked straight in my eyes and she said, Seattle has to have a film Commission.",20,,
116,0.97,732.898,739.238,To be taken seriously by producers who are looking for a location.,20,,
117,0.97,739.238,750.249,"Because they want to see that government has skin in the game and they will be a positive partner, if they choose to locate there and do a production.",20,,
118,0.97,750.249,753.419,"So, mind you, Montana knows how to promote itself.",20,,
119,0.97,753.419,772.705,"They have had a film office since 1974 and from July, let's see, July, 2020 two June, 2022, 119 productions have been filmed there.",20,,
120,0.97,772.705,775.741,You may have heard of big sky or Yellowstone.,20,,
121,0.97,775.741,777.743,That keeps coming up on my feed.,20,,
122,0.97,777.743,783.048,That translates to 840 local jobs and an economic impact of $154 million.,20,,
123,0.97,783.048,794.86,"So that was a new angle for me, coming from sort of another place, outside of what I have been talking about so far.",20,,
124,0.97,794.86,799.298,"So if the question is, why do we need another Commission?",20,,
125,0.97,799.298,800.833,Or why is a film Commission important?,20,,
126,0.97,800.833,807.072,"I would say, why would we not have a film Commission?",20,,
127,0.97,807.072,818.817,It is what our creative's want and need to thrive in Seattle and it is also what our city needs to fulfill our promises for advancing equity and opportunity.,20,,
128,0.97,818.817,839.738,"And as we heard in public comment, it is what our region and state needs to take advantage of this historic moment of $15 million of new incentives and everything going on at the county and the opening of harbor Island studios.",20,,
129,0.97,839.738,845.544,It's what we need to align policies to put Seattle back on the map as the best city to make film in the nation.,20,,
130,0.97,845.544,852.318,"So, with that, I am going to turn it over to Yolanda from central staff.",20,,
131,0.97,852.318,855.721,We are in the last episode of a very long journey.,20,,
132,0.97,855.721,861.66,She will go over the legislation and then we will open it up for questions.,20,,
133,0.97,861.66,867.366,"Go ahead, Yolanda.",20,,
134,0.97,867.366,870.402,I've got to find my Unmute button.,21,,
135,0.97,870.402,876.108,"All right, Yolanda Council central staff.",21,,

139,0.97,900.499,920.085,I will also NOTE some minor changes that were made between the introduction draft and that draft that is in the legislation before you today and then discuss some of the potential impacts of the creation of this new Commission.,21,,
140,0.97,920.085,928.494,"So, as a quick summary, legislation was developed in collaboration with the office of economic development and film industry representatives.",21,,
141,0.97,928.494,957.222,"So, this Council bill 120412 would establish a new Seattle film Commission staffed by the office of economic development, otherwise known as Oed, to advise and make recommendations to the city on the development of policies and programs that enhance the economic development of Seattle's film industry, including promoting the sustainable growth of family wage jobs for workers who have been historically Underrepresented in the industry.",21,,
142,0.97,957.222,974.606,"The goals of the Commission are to inform and influence the regional film industry and community, in partnership with the city, to address disparities caused by systemic racism, so that Seattle is at the forefront of driving equity, inclusion, and economic prosperity.",21,,
143,0.97,974.606,986.352,"And to advance the city's economic development priorities in the creative economy, by serving as a Conduit between the city, the film industry, and the community to attract and retain local, regional, national, and global business.",21,,
144,0.97,986.352,997.763,Build inclusive career pathways into the film industry and advise on the development of efforts that reinforce and grow the role of film in the regions content and creative industries.,21,,
145,0.97,997.763,1003.102,"In terms of membership, the Commission would have 11 members.",21,,
146,0.97,1003.102,1010.776,"Five appointed by the Mayor, five appointed by the Council, and one by the Commission members once the other 10 have been appointed.",21,,
147,0.97,1010.776,1021.72,All of these appointments would be confirmed by the Council and you can see industry groups as listed on the slide.,21,,
148,0.97,1021.72,1024.79,Same as last time you saw.,21,,
149,0.97,1024.79,1034.533,"So in terms of duties, it would be engaging with industry professionals to inform development of city efforts.",21,,
150,0.97,1034.533,1038.604,Advocating for the interests of the local film industry to the city and wider community.,21,,
151,0.97,1038.604,1051.383,Collaborating with the city to ensure that Seattle's film priorities are in alignment with those of King County and Washington State and advising the city in the development of efforts to support the film industry.,21,,

157,0.97,1082.481,1086.752,As the Commission gets established.,21,,
158,0.97,1086.752,1095.494,"It also authorizes Oed to provide compensation, if serving on the Commission presents a financial hardship.",21,,
159,0.97,1095.494,1109.475,"So, just to highlight the differences between the Pre- introduction draft that was presented to the committee last month and the introduced version today.",21,,
160,0.97,1109.475,1115.147,Attachment one to the memo on the agenda shows a Redline version.,21,,

164,0.97,1136.235,1136.401,No?,21,,
165,0.97,1136.401,1139.738,"So, potential impacts.",21,,
166,0.97,1139.738,1151.25,"Just noting that the city does have over 70 boards and commissions that provide advice and recommendations on a variety of topics to the Council, Mayor, and city departments.",21,,
167,0.97,1151.25,1165.43,There is no advisory board for the film industry in this new Commission would provide industry specific expertise to advise on the development of film related efforts to advance the city's economic development priorities in the creative economy.,21,,
168,0.97,1165.43,1176.074,"So you are aware, there is already a Seattle music Commission that was established initially by resolution in 2010.",21,,
169,0.97,1176.074,1177.142,Later codified in 2014.,21,,
170,0.97,1177.142,1187.686,The new film Commission would be required to meet annually with the existing music Commission to encourage collaboration between the two complementary industry groups.,21,,
171,0.97,1187.686,1200.399,"In terms of fiscal and administrative, the advisory body, as all advisory bodies, will require dedicated staffing to support its work and potentially additional funding to provide hardship compensation.",21,,
172,0.97,1200.399,1214.079,Noting that Oed has a film program manager position who is expected to be assigned responsibility for staffing this new Commission.,21,,
173,0.97,1214.079,1216.415,So no additional staff are anticipated to be required for this purpose.,21,,
174,0.97,1216.415,1220.786,The amount of hardship compensation cannot be known at this time.,21,,
175,0.97,1220.786,1240.505,Members would need to request compensation from Oed and Oed would then need to determine what an appropriate compensation rate would be and I am noting here that the city is currently in the process of evaluating compensation practices for advisory bodies across departments to help establish standards moving forward.,21,,
176,0.97,1240.505,1242.14,So that will inform that compensation rate.,21,,
177,0.97,1242.14,1253.685,"Once the numbers have been appointed, they may request additional ongoing funding to support their efforts, which has been the case for a number of the advisory bodies.",21,,
178,0.97,1253.685,1263.729,"For example the music Commission allocated $50,000 annually for the city music career days and industry Roadshows.",21,,
179,0.97,1263.729,1270.535,"It is also possible the work of the Commission could provide financial benefits to the city indirectly, via increased tax revenues.",21,,
180,0.97,1270.535,1280.078,"As the committee learned about last month and also during public comment by Kate Becker, there are a couple of related efforts at the state and county level.",21,,
181,0.97,1280.078,1297.162,"There was the increased business and occupation tax credit cap for the motion picture competitiveness program and also the recent opening of King County's harbor Island studios, in Seattle last year.",21,,
182,0.97,1297.162,1308.206,"In conjunction with the establishment of the Commission, these efforts combined could result in increased revenue for businesses in Seattle that are directly and indirectly related to film production.",21,,
183,0.97,1308.206,1323.588,"Finally on the topic of racial equity, one of the Commission's goals is to address disparities in the film industry that have resulted from systemic racism.",21,,
184,0.97,1323.588,1334.966,A report last year by a consulting firm found that black talent is Underrepresented throughout the industry at the national level and this disparity is particularly pronounced in positions at the executive level.,21,,
185,0.97,1334.966,1337.836,Which has been and continues to be predominantly white and male.,21,,
186,0.97,1337.836,1354.853,"This legislation recognizes this reality and the Commission, in partnership with the city, would endeavor to shift the industry and community so it is more welcoming and inclusive to black, indigenous, and other people of color.",21,,
187,0.97,1354.853,1358.49,"With that, that is the end of my overview of the legislation.",21,,
188,0.97,1358.49,1366.431,I will answer any questions.,21,,
189,0.97,1366.431,1368.066,Do my colleagues have any questions?,22,,
190,0.97,1368.066,1370.702,"Yes, Councilmember Herbold.",22,,
191,0.97,1370.702,1377.409,"Thank you so much and thank you, Madam chair, forgetting this work over the finish line, as you mentioned.",23,,
192,0.97,1377.409,1383.682,A number of us had been endeavoring.,23,,
193,0.97,1383.682,1387.119,"Years prior, under the previous administration.",23,,
194,0.97,1387.119,1397.929,I particularly requested recommendations from Oed back in 2019.,23,,
195,0.97,1397.929,1404.636,With oversight with the office of economic development.,23,,
196,0.97,1404.636,1407.672,"I also sponsored in 2020, requesting that Oed provide recommendations.",23,,
197,0.97,1407.672,1419.651,"Oed, to their credit, did provide a response in November, 2020, that did offer some high- level guidance.",23,,
198,0.97,1419.651,1424.322,But the legislation establishing the new Commission did not move forward until now.,23,,
199,0.97,1424.322,1429.394,"Again, thank you so much.",23,,
200,0.97,1429.394,1442.374,"One thing that you may have covered, Yolanda, but I did not catch, you talked about the creative industry positions within the office of economic development that are intended to support the film Commission?",23,,
201,0.97,1442.374,1445.043,Sure.,24,,
202,0.97,1445.043,1453.185,"So there is the film program manager position, which I believe you, Councilmember, helped create and budget a couple of years ago.",24,,
203,0.97,1453.185,1465.363,"There is currently a proviso on one of the positions that Councilmember Morales, I believe, sponsored during the budget last year.",24,,
204,0.97,1465.363,1466.932,That was the policy advisor position.,24,,
205,0.97,1466.932,1480.045,"So what was the creative industry director position, during last year's budget that got Repurposed into a new position.",24,,
206,0.97,1480.045,1482.547,"So that is more of a general, leadership role.",24,,
207,0.97,1482.547,1490.222,And then there was a proposal in the budget around creating this creative industry manager position.,24,,
208,0.97,1490.222,1498.897,So I believe Oed is in the process of kind of evaluating its workforce needs.,24,,
209,0.97,1498.897,1512.644,"There are also the folks doing the permitting for events, so those people continue to do what they are doing in those positions.",24,,
210,0.97,1512.644,1518.583,I think there is the creative industry policy advisor that had been added in the 2020 adopted budget that is kind of influx right now.,24,,
211,0.97,1518.583,1530.195,"Oed is in the process of developing their proposal for that role, kind of within the larger picture of their priorities.",24,,
212,0.97,1530.195,1537.269,It sounds like there may be some changes as a result of that evaluation.,25,,
213,0.97,1537.269,1547.012,But it also sounds like there are not currently any positions to help support the film Commission at times?,25,,
214,0.97,1547.012,1548.213,There is.,26,,
215,0.97,1548.213,1551.65,There is.,26,,
216,0.97,1551.65,1557.422,All right.,27,,
217,0.97,1557.422,1561.893,"Chris is so involved in the on the ground permitting work, right?",27,,
218,0.97,1561.893,1569.134,"So, we happen to have the director of the office of economic development --",28,,
219,0.97,1569.134,1581.947,"I just mean, like, the support to the film Commission, I think might be a little bit of a different role than what we are talking about, but I may be completely wrong.",29,,
220,0.97,1581.947,1583.481,Chris wears a lot of different hats.,29,,
221,0.97,1583.481,1590.088,"There are a lot of different hats, but he is our subject matter expert on film.",30,,
222,0.97,1590.088,1595.093,He has been the one leaving that of element of this Commission both with Oed and with our partners in the region.,30,,
223,0.97,1595.093,1600.065,So Chris is best suited to support this Commission as it gets started.,30,,
224,0.97,1600.065,1608.807,"Now as I have said before and as I talked with you, Councilmember Herbold, Oed is going through a lot of changes on staffing and focus.",30,,
225,0.97,1608.807,1617.916,"That might change over time, but as we get set up, Chris is by far the best position to get off the ground and make sure it is set up for success.",30,,
226,0.97,1617.916,1625.457,Thank you.,31,,
227,0.97,1625.457,1627.025,"Okay, are there any other questions?",32,,
228,0.97,1627.025,1638.036,"I have to say speaking of the creative economy, and you might've been the driving force of this, Councilmember Herbold, but this is a report from 2019, creative economy report.",32,,
229,0.97,1638.036,1644.943,City of Seattle put it together in conjunction with--let's see.,32,,
230,0.97,1644.943,1653.652,"Well, it was Kate Becker and a director of office and arts and culture.",32,,
231,0.97,1653.652,1655.253,And the interim director of Oed.,32,,
232,0.97,1655.253,1671.136,"So, we do have 67 pages of information about the creative economy and the prop I was looking for earlier was here is the final 2020 report from the Seattle film task force.",32,,
233,0.97,1671.136,1672.937,So we've got a lot of momentum going here.,32,,
234,0.97,1672.937,1680.011,"We just need, as you are right to say, some focused attention.",32,,
235,0.97,1680.011,1690.221,And I believe I echo director Markham McIntyre when he says Chris is really the right person for that.,32,,
236,0.97,1690.221,1690.522,Anyway.,32,,
237,0.97,1690.522,1699.564,"I want to say I was absolutely not the driving force for that 2019 report, but I returned to them often.",33,,
238,0.97,1699.564,1704.469,Citing the Stats from those reports.,33,,
239,0.97,1704.469,1720.985,"Because they are some of the best reports that identify both the need for the workforce, to really pay attention to growing, particularly parts of the workforce.",33,,
240,0.97,1720.985,1732.664,"I returned to that report over and over again, but it was not my Brainchild.",33,,
241,0.97,1732.664,1734.499,I firmly believe it was Randy and Kate's Brainchild.,33,,
242,0.97,1734.499,1739.404,"Great, now that we've got that straight, it was your staff that sent it to me.",34,,
243,0.97,1739.404,1742.607,"So, thank you everybody.",34,,
244,0.97,1742.607,1753.218,"I don't see anybody with their hands raised, so now, Yolanda, it would now be time to move the bill and the amendment.",34,,
245,0.97,1753.218,1756.221,Would you like to speak to that or just go ahead and move?,34,,
246,0.97,1756.221,1759.357,You want to move the bill and then we can talk about the amendment?,35,,

343,0.97,2287.852,2304.468,"So about a year ago, last summer, 2021, using the Coronavirus local fiscal recovery funds from the American rescue plan act, which were Federal funds coming into the city, Oed designed and launched the neighborhood economic recovery Fund.",75,,

450,0.97,3128.191,3135.932,We have barely had the chance to start thinking long-term because of so many immediate needs.,83,,
451,0.97,3135.932,3144.574,"I was glad to be part of the Cohort, where we had a chance to step back and reflect on their experiences as Bipoc community workers in Bipoc neighborhoods.",83,,
452,0.97,3144.574,3156.653,"We discussed how to implement equitable programs, how to allow experimentation with different economic development models, and uplift the issues we have been hearing on the ground to drive policy and programs.",83,,

462,0.97,3213.043,3241.037,"As we know, the Covid-19 pandemic made the Vulnerabilities of Bipoc small businesses more visible and in working with businesses during the pandemic, I witnessed the most effective strategies to build equitable economic practices have developed out of Collaborations, alliances, and, most importantly, the strength of Community-Based practices.",84,,
463,0.97,3241.037,3248.812,"For example, the collective that was built during the pandemic.",84,,
464,0.97,3248.812,3254.317,"That alliance and many others, just picking the ones that I know.",84,,
465,0.97,3254.317,3256.553,And the Bipoc spring Cohort that I was part of.,84,,
466,0.97,3256.553,3260.991,This past spring.,84,,
467,0.97,3260.991,3272.802,"In these Collaborations, community members identify specific and collective challenges and work together to build focused strategies.",84,,
468,0.97,3272.802,3277.44,The Cohort provided space to learn from one another.,84,,
469,0.97,3277.44,3291.588,To honor the role that each community has played and continues to play in building our city and to build a vision in which we are empowered participants in the present and future of a rapidly changing city.,84,,

471,0.97,3315.111,3315.445,Thank you.,84,,
472,0.97,3315.445,3318.281,Hi everyone.,85,,
473,0.97,3318.281,3319.916,My name is Maria Vargas.,85,,
474,0.97,3319.916,3325.655,I am a community development manager at Homesight.,85,,
475,0.97,3325.655,3334.998,I first want to take a moment to show gratitude for the Bipoc Cohort and the space it provided.,85,,
476,0.97,3334.998,3344.307,"I think a major take away we all experienced was collaboration, but in addition it was a sense of relief and a sense of having an open and welcoming space for all of us.",85,,
477,0.97,3344.307,3364.994,"I think it can be challenging to continue to support and hear the grievances of businesses and do all we can, but it was refreshing to collaborate and share ideas and that the end of the day we all left the room more energized and ready to tackle more challenges and help more people.",85,,
478,0.97,3364.994,3373.803,"But, yes, in my specific district, one of the most diverse communities.",85,,
479,0.97,3373.803,3378.842,"Over 30 languages are spoken and I definitely agree, the pandemic has Wreaked havoc on small businesses.",85,,
480,0.97,3378.842,3384.981,"But you know they continue to open every day, despite Break- INS, despite everything.",85,,
481,0.97,3384.981,3398.361,They show their grit and determination and I think we all have such appreciation and admiration for the small businesses and what they go through.,85,,

485,0.97,3412.742,3418.414,The first one is from Hayward Watson from the central area collaborative.,86,,
486,0.97,3418.414,3433.096,He says the Bipoc Cohort process is important to me because it has allowed me to put words to my experiences of working in a historically excluded community and vocalize those experiences in a way that is understood by the people in Oed.,86,,
487,0.97,3433.096,3438.334,"I will close with this response from Anthony Johnson, from chief Seattle club.",86,,
488,0.97,3438.334,3448.912,"From an indigenous and native perspective, what we know to be true is that the native peoples in the Puget sound have never had agency over the future of their land, people, or economy.",86,,

656,0.97,4399.528,4409.004,"However, we are required to communicate any breakdown in internal controls that are deemed to be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies.",115,,
657,0.97,4409.004,4416.245,"So, the profession requires us to categorize any control deficiencies we identify in order of severity.",115,,
658,0.97,4416.245,4419.515,The most severe would be a material weakness.,115,,
659,0.97,4419.515,4434.096,That is any breakdown of controls or combination of controls that could lead to a more than reasonable possibility that the breakdown would result in a material Misstatement your financial statement.,115,,
660,0.97,4434.096,4436.598,"Again, that is the most severe and we did not identify material weaknesses.",115,,
661,0.97,4436.598,4440.903,The next is what we call significant deficiency.,115,,
662,0.97,4440.903,4448.61,"Less severe, but large enough deficiency that it would warrant attention with Governance.",115,,
663,0.97,4448.61,4451.113,I am pleased to report we did not identify any significant deficiencies.,115,,
664,0.97,4451.113,4461.123,"Now as part of any audit, we will always have minor control deficiencies, industry best practice recommendations, things to that extent.",115,,
665,0.97,4461.123,4469.565,"Those are things we communicate with management at the end of the audit, but none of those rows to your attention being a material weakness or significant deficiency.",115,,
666,0.97,4469.565,4470.466,"Next slide, please.",115,,
667,0.97,4470.466,4479.007,One of the documents you received was the audit results letter.,115,,
668,0.97,4479.007,4484.079,A couple things I want to call attention to.,115,,
669,0.97,4484.079,4487.749,It does include a section for required communication.,115,,
670,0.97,4487.749,4494.022,"I will go through these items in detail, but a couple of things I wanted to highlight quickly.",115,,
671,0.97,4494.022,4499.928,One of the items as all of the significant accounting policies can be found in the notes to your financial statements.,115,,
672,0.97,4499.928,4502.798,An example of which would be the capitalization policy.,115,,
673,0.97,4502.798,4513.609,"What we do is review that policy, make sure it complies with generally accepted accounting principal and also that you are following those policies.",115,,
674,0.97,4513.609,4522.084,"If we had any difficulties encountered during our audit or any significant issues or findings, we would be required to communicate those.",115,,
675,0.97,4522.084,4526.355,We did not identify anything like that.,115,,
676,0.97,4526.355,4531.86,Just know that if we did this would not be the first time you would be hearing about that.,115,,
677,0.97,4531.86,4535.097,I would reach out to the chair to have those discussions on a timely basis.,115,,
678,0.97,4535.097,4539.568,The last thing you want are any surprises when you get to the presentation.,115,,
679,0.97,4539.568,4549.545,"If we had any misstatements we would be required to disclose those to you and if you look at the audit results letter, you will see that we have those summarized again.",115,,
680,0.97,4549.545,4559.021,"Those are immaterial and insignificant, but what we are required to do is keep track of them.",115,,
681,0.97,4559.021,4562.224,"We find these with many clients, just in order to close the books.",115,,
682,0.97,4562.224,4565.56,Oftentimes management may find an entry that could potentially be posted.,115,,
683,0.97,4565.56,4578.34,"Because it is immaterial and insignificant, they are choosing not to, just to continue to be able to close the books and move forward to the next year.",115,,
684,0.97,4578.34,4582.177,We just need to keep track of that and you can find that in this document as well.,115,,
685,0.97,4582.177,4584.813,"The other item I mentioned, we did not have any material corrected statements.",115,,
686,0.97,4584.813,4591.486,One item we include in this letter is what we call her management representation letter.,115,,
687,0.97,4591.486,4596.591,It includes all of the representations management makes as part of the audit process.,115,,
688,0.97,4596.591,4604.333,"You can find things relative to their thoughts on the accounting policies, internal controls, fraud, things to that extent.",115,,
689,0.97,4604.333,4617.312,"So if you have not, I would urge you to take a look at that letter to see what types of representation the management team makes as part of the audit process.",115,,
690,0.97,4617.312,4618.981,And I just wanted to touch on independence.,115,,
691,0.97,4618.981,4629.524,"Independence is a significant issue relative to the audit and I am here to say that not only our firm, but every individual on your audit engagement is independent with your organization in fact and appearance.",115,,
692,0.97,4629.524,4638.1,"To wrap up again, I would like to thank the entire management team.",115,,
693,0.97,4638.1,4643.105,"Christie, Natalie, Julia, and also Jeff and their entire team.",115,,
694,0.97,4643.105,4645.874,A lot of people put a lot of work and effort into this.,115,,
695,0.97,4645.874,4649.511,"Not only accounting transactions throughout the year, but also assisting with this audit process.",115,,
696,0.97,4649.511,4659.988,With that we are extremely thankful and I will open it up to any questions anyone might have.,115,,
697,0.97,4659.988,4660.589,Thank you.,116,,
698,0.97,4660.589,4676.038,"I have to say, and item that was not on the long list that was referred to, however, was that a half-hour of those 1400 hours was spent in a meeting with me to surface any concerns I might have and I had none.",116,,
699,0.97,4676.038,4678.874,"You will read that in the letter, maybe.",116,,
700,0.97,4678.874,4684.212,So I just want to say thank you for this exhaustive body of work.,116,,

820,0.97,5340.234,5352.814,"The first is a gradual increase in fixed basic service charges for residential customers, which is similar to other major utilities across the country.",155,,
821,0.97,5352.814,5355.95,The second is the introduction of a fixed basic service charge for nonresidential customers.,155,,
822,0.97,5355.95,5368.296,The intent on the basic service charge is really designed to cover the cost that it takes to have a customer.,155,,
823,0.97,5368.296,5374.702,Things like billing cost and meter reading and customer service.,155,,
824,0.97,5374.702,5378.84,These are all overhead charges previously embedded in the rate.,155,,
825,0.97,5378.84,5381.042,This is a great move toward a more transparent approach.,155,,
826,0.97,5381.042,5399.794,I would also like to point out that the tools city light has for the discount programs are some of the most robust in the country and those remain in place for anybody that needs financial assistance.,155,,
827,0.97,5399.794,5408.936,The third point is the introduction of a voluntary time of day or TOD rates for residential and commercial customers.,155,,
828,0.97,5408.936,5414.842,This gives customers greater control over the billing rate by time of day.,155,,
829,0.97,5414.842,5433.494,And if enough customers embrace it that will reduce the overall peak demand and allow city light to save on the cost of purchasing additional peak power.,155,,
830,0.97,5433.494,5438.132,"As is noted in our letter, this proposal is not intended to increase the overall amount of revenue collected.",155,,
831,0.97,5438.132,5443.471,It is about a policy choice on how the revenue is collected.,155,,
832,0.97,5443.471,5454.816,In 2019 the review panel sent a very intensive six-month study and rate design at the city council's request.,155,,
833,0.97,5454.816,5469.263,"We engaged dozens of Stakeholders in that effort and ultimately submitted a report to the city Council, which had eight overall policy goals.",155,,
834,0.97,5469.263,5476.938,This proposal in front of you tackle several of those policy goals that we identify in this report and I will just quickly mention a few of those.,155,,
835,0.97,5476.938,5479.841,The first was transparency of rates.,155,,
836,0.97,5479.841,5486.914,This allows customers to see what the basic service rate is.,155,,
837,0.97,5486.914,5487.982,So it answers that question.,155,,
838,0.97,5487.982,5491.752,I think it is a great first step.,155,,
839,0.97,5491.752,5507.235,Revenue sufficiency was another one of the Keystones and we have a good fix on the amount of revenue required and the ability to collect that is not impacted by this proposal.,155,,
840,0.97,5507.235,5507.635,Efficiency.,155,,
841,0.97,5507.635,5526.754,"The proposal creates financial incentives for customers to save money on electric power and to use it at a time when there is less demand and, therefore, as I said before, reduces utilities cost on the open market.",155,,
842,0.97,5526.754,5531.192,The Carbonization was another element.,155,,
843,0.97,5531.192,5548.042,"The Electrification of Transportation will advance the climate agenda and one of the outcomes we hope that people adopt, the time of day option, will help offset that growing electric need from transportation.",155,,
844,0.97,5548.042,5552.747,The last I would like to mention is customer choice.,155,,
845,0.97,5552.747,5559.02,We heard loud and clear that customers wanted choice in how they purchase electricity and this time of day option will provide that.,155,,
846,0.97,5559.02,5574.468,So Additionally we have endorsed a rigorous outreach and education effort to explain the new opportunities and those advantages to the customers across all classes.,155,,
847,0.97,5574.468,5584.412,The panel will monitor the impacts of these changes to ensure the desired outcomes are achieved.,155,,
848,0.97,5584.412,5591.953,"From this policy perspective, the panel supports the rate design proposal.",155,,
849,0.97,5591.953,5606.334,I am glad to see this proposal before you after the major effort we undertook in 2019 and the review panel is unanimously recommending that the city council give a favorable consideration to city light's request on this proposal.,155,,
850,0.97,5606.334,5620.815,"Finally I would like you to know, how professional and patient Debra Smith and her entire staff have been throughout our work and my time over the last three years.",155,,
851,0.97,5620.815,5628.889,You have an absolutely terrific team in place at Seattle city light and you should be very proud of what they've done.,155,,
852,0.97,5628.889,5631.726,Thank you and I would be happy to answer any questions anybody might have.,155,,
853,0.97,5631.726,5632.994,Thank you for that.,156,,
854,0.97,5632.994,5633.761,Colleagues?,156,,
855,0.97,5633.761,5640.901,Are there any questions before going on to Eric Mcconaghy?,156,,
856,0.97,5640.901,5641.736,No?,156,,
857,0.97,5641.736,5649.61,"Okay, I will turn it over to Eric to touch on some brief points.",156,,
858,0.97,5649.61,5651.345,"Although that was a great set up, right?",156,,
859,0.97,5651.345,5655.916,"So go ahead, we do have a central staff memo, so the floor is yours.",156,,
860,0.97,5655.916,5660.121,Thank you very much.,157,,
861,0.97,5660.121,5661.789,That was a great introduction and I appreciate that.,157,,
862,0.97,5661.789,5666.06,I appreciate his work and all the work of the folks on the panel.,157,,
863,0.97,5666.06,5676.437,I have the good fortune of sitting in on those meetings and the support from staff and the general manager is great.,157,,
864,0.97,5676.437,5682.309,It is a good working system.,157,,
865,0.97,5682.309,5689.25,"That being said, much of the ordinance we covered in the previous meeting and today we covered in the presentation before me.",157,,
866,0.97,5689.25,5693.621,"I will quickly sketch the key Takeaways, things to note for the public.",157,,
867,0.97,5693.621,5696.957,About the bill.,157,,
868,0.97,5696.957,5701.195,And leave a little bit of space for questions.,157,,
869,0.97,5701.195,5710.137,"As you have heard, this bill would codify the new rates.",157,,
870,0.97,5710.137,5714.442,It would establish a new base charge for residential customers beginning in 2023.,157,,
871,0.97,5714.442,5731.058,"It SETS up optional time of day rates beginning in 2024 for residential, small customers--that would include charging electric vehicles for medium and large general service customers.",157,,
872,0.97,5731.058,5737.364,It updates the large customer solar export rate as well and there are tactical changes as well.,157,,
873,0.97,5737.364,5741.635,It Reorganizes rate schedules for Non-City customers for eligibility.,157,,
874,0.97,5741.635,5754.248,"It updates the 2022 rates to reflect the actual effective rates, based on reduction of the rate that comes from a viable power pass through.",157,,
875,0.97,5754.248,5758.085,And then it makes technical changes to definitions that correspond to the updates I just mentioned.,157,,
876,0.97,5758.085,5760.421,So it is a quick rundown for the record.,157,,
877,0.97,5760.421,5776.37,Overall the bill does stick to what was approved for the adoption of the strategic plan and the rate path and an increase on average of 4.5% in 2023 and 2024.,157,,
878,0.97,5776.37,5777.171,That is my rundown.,157,,
879,0.97,5777.171,5788.749,I am happy to answer any questions and also happy to yield space for Carsten Croff to answer questions or offer any pieces that I missed.,157,,
880,0.97,5788.749,5789.75,"Thank you, Eric.",158,,
881,0.97,5789.75,5796.857,I do want to touch on something that Mister Hanson referred to as customer choice.,158,,
882,0.97,5796.857,5803.364,"You know, we heard news reports this past week, maybe the week before.",158,,
883,0.97,5803.364,5815.009,The extreme heat in California led utilities to urge electric vehicle owners to charge their cars at night to reduce demand during peak hours.,158,,
884,0.97,5815.009,5822.65,"When these rates are implemented, not only will the time of day option provide relief to our grid, customers will also pay less.",158,,
885,0.97,5822.65,5830.391,So that is a great innovation that came out of that work.,158,,
886,0.97,5830.391,5840.434,"I know that that has been a priority for a long time with my colleagues, and I think it is doing right by our Ratepayers and constituents, so thank you.",158,,
887,0.97,5840.434,5847.241,"By the way, what position do you hold on the review panel?",158,,
888,0.97,5847.241,5848.475,I am currently the chair.,159,,
889,0.97,5848.475,5849.076,"Oh, no.",160,,
890,0.97,5849.076,5851.245,My job?,161,,
891,0.97,5851.245,5854.515,I am commercial customer representative.,161,,
892,0.97,5854.515,5858.819,"Sorry I did not say that, it must have slipped my mind.",161,,
893,0.97,5858.819,5861.322,I probably missed it.,162,,
894,0.97,5861.322,5870.664,"Okay colleagues, I see that Councilmember Herbold has her hand up.",163,,
895,0.97,5870.664,5873.1,"Go ahead and then I will get to you, Councilmember Strauss.",163,,
896,0.97,5873.1,5885.713,I really appreciate the customer review panel guidance and comprehensive review of this proposal.,164,,
897,0.97,5885.713,5892.353,I don't have as much experience working with the city light customer review panel.,164,,
898,0.97,5892.353,5899.827,I did have a lot of experience working with the utility's review panel and I really relied on them.,164,,
899,0.97,5899.827,5922.216,"Not just for guidance on Seattle public utilities rate proposal, but also looking at ways to innovate and push the utility, much like I see the review panel is doing in this instance.",164,,
900,0.97,5922.216,5928.122,I am very interested in the voluntary program.,164,,
901,0.97,5928.122,5949.843,That allows the optional end of day rates and appreciate there are some criteria that customers must adhere to in order to opt into that program.,164,,
902,0.97,5949.843,5954.081,It seems like a fairly low bar.,164,,
903,0.97,5954.081,5963.857,"This ability to opt into these rates, I think are potentially of great benefit.",164,,
904,0.97,5963.857,5997.391,"I am wondering, our representative from the customer review panel can tell us, because I know one of the recommendations relates to public information and communication about rates and I am just wondering, what can we do to let the public know about the option and the criteria to opt in and how it might benefit them?",164,,
905,0.97,5997.391,5998.625,"Certainly, I can address that.",165,,
906,0.97,5998.625,6003.297,"Again my name is Carsten Croff, I am the manager of the financial planning and rates team.",165,,
907,0.97,6003.297,6011.839,Customer communication is going to be a huge part of these time of day rates.,165,,
908,0.97,6011.839,6019.68,"I'm excited to have them and design them, but a lot of people--work in terms of implementation.",165,,
909,0.97,6019.68,6029.256,Being able to reach out to customers and let customers Kow if they will be a good candidate for potential savings.,165,,
910,0.97,6029.256,6034.461,And to shift consumption to be able to save on their electricity bills.,165,,
911,0.97,6034.461,6043.871,So that customer outreach is work that will be ongoing next year and certainly a very high profile with utility.,165,,
912,0.97,6043.871,6046.707,Any follow-ups there?,166,,
913,0.97,6046.707,6062.356,It was not clear to me on the opt in to the time of day rates for vehicle charging.,167,,
914,0.97,6062.356,6063.19,I may have misread.,167,,
915,0.97,6063.19,6064.425,I looked at the memo quickly.,167,,
916,0.97,6064.425,6079.239,Is that only commercial vehicles or is there an ability for personal vehicle charging to take advantage of the time of day rates as well?,167,,
917,0.97,6079.239,6090.784,"You know, residential customers will be able to time into the rates and --",168,,
918,0.97,6090.784,6091.585,Including the car.,169,,
919,0.97,6091.585,6096.89,"If they have an electric vehicle, they will be able to take advantage of that as well.",170,,
920,0.97,6096.89,6097.291,Thank you.,171,,
921,0.97,6097.291,6103.397,"For my information, customers can opt in at any point.",172,,
922,0.97,6103.397,6104.932,They don't have to commit right away.,172,,
923,0.97,6104.932,6111.572,"They are not going to Miss the boat if they don't get the memo, as we try to do this outreach.",172,,
924,0.97,6111.572,6113.14,They can switch over.,172,,
925,0.97,6113.14,6114.308,It will be ongoing.,173,,
926,0.97,6114.308,6118.612,This is the first phase of introducing time of day rates.,173,,
927,0.97,6118.612,6126.82,We expect to continue to evolve as time goes out and be able to potentially provide more options.,173,,
928,0.97,6126.82,6132.226,But the enrollment will be ongoing with customers.,173,,
929,0.97,6132.226,6139.399,"So, just to Weigh-In, thank you, Carsten, and thank you, chair.",174,,
930,0.97,6139.399,6153.38,"The rate will be available beginning 2024 and the code does provide for opting in for a certain amount of time, but there is not a narrow window where everyone has to get in otherwise you can't get in.",174,,
931,0.97,6153.38,6166.193,"My understanding, maybe this is a question for you, once folks opt in, they stay within that rate structure for a while.",174,,
932,0.97,6166.193,6167.561,They don't bounce in and out.,174,,
933,0.97,6167.561,6170.03,Maybe you can say a couple words about that if you don't mind.,174,,
934,0.97,6170.03,6174.902,There will be a provision where the customer Opts into time of day rates.,175,,
935,0.97,6174.902,6181.008,They can opt out at any time if they are not seeing the savings they want or they want to opt out for any other reason.,175,,
936,0.97,6181.008,6184.244,One thing is they will not be able to Re-Opt in for one year.,175,,
937,0.97,6184.244,6193.854,This is to protect against people changing for seasonal variations and seasonal consumption changes.,175,,
938,0.97,6193.854,6194.955,Thank you.,176,,
939,0.97,6194.955,6199.726,"Okay, Councilmember Strauss.",177,,
940,0.97,6199.726,6200.661,You have a hand up.,177,,
941,0.97,6200.661,6203.53,"Thank you, chair Nelson.",178,,
942,0.97,6203.53,6204.565,"Carsten, great to see you.",178,,
943,0.97,6204.565,6208.402,"Great to see you, sir.",178,,
944,0.97,6208.402,6210.037,My questions will be Rhetorical in nature.,178,,
945,0.97,6210.037,6216.51,Never mind what the rate increases were during 2020 and 2021.,178,,
946,0.97,6216.51,6220.247,"2020, we did not have an effective rate change.",179,,
947,0.97,6220.247,6238.899,"2021, we had come I believe, 3.9% adopted great change, but that was offset by a Bpa Pass- through, so the effective rate change was over 2%.",179,,
948,0.97,6238.899,6254.047,"Okay, so no rate change in 2020 and a 2.1% rate increase in 2021, which was less than the adopted increase that city light could have taken.",180,,
949,0.97,6254.047,6257.384,Correct.,181,,
950,0.97,6257.384,6272.032,"Then in 2022, I noticed lied to from your presentation, you state that the 2022 increase was 2.1%, which was less than the 3.9% increase approved by the former strategic plan.",182,,
951,0.97,6272.032,6273.2,Is that an accurate understanding?,182,,
952,0.97,6273.2,6277.738,That is correct.,183,,
953,0.97,6277.738,6280.607,Can you remind me of the rate increase we are talking about today?,184,,
954,0.97,6280.607,6285.912,We have an average increase of 4.5% for 2023 and 2024.,185,,
955,0.97,6285.912,6289.483,"Again, through the strategic plan.",185,,
956,0.97,6289.483,6303.33,"I will add, this is something Debra mentioned last month, that preliminary information in terms of rates for 2024, looked very optimistic.",185,,
957,0.97,6303.33,6304.131,For city light.,185,,
958,0.97,6304.131,6307.801,Our bills will be lower than planned.,185,,
959,0.97,6307.801,6313.073,Those savings would be able to be passed through to the customers.,185,,
960,0.97,6313.073,6316.543,"So, things are very uncertain, but at this point it looks like the rates will be lower.",185,,
961,0.97,6316.543,6323.317,The effective rate increase will be lower than 4.5% in 2024.,185,,
962,0.97,6323.317,6324.151,Thank you.,186,,
963,0.97,6324.151,6339.666,"So the effective increases at most 4.5% and I see from slide 10 on your presentation that the current 2022 outlook for inflation is 4.8%, 5.1%, and 3.1% in 2023.",186,,
964,0.97,6339.666,6350.477,So I guess what I am getting at is you are asking to raise the rates lower than the inflationary costs that you are taking on.,186,,
965,0.97,6350.477,6351.478,Is that a correct assessment?,186,,
966,0.97,6351.478,6357.551,That is correct and I will note that those were inflation numbers from the end of 2021.,187,,
967,0.97,6357.551,6365.459,"As you know since then, inflation for 2022 has continued to grow.",187,,
968,0.97,6365.459,6367.36,So that would be an underestimate of the installation.,187,,
969,0.97,6367.36,6373.6,I have to say I am someone who does not like to increase the rates to our customers.,188,,
970,0.97,6373.6,6381.942,I ask these questions because I think your Department is done a good job in keeping rates as low as possible.,188,,
971,0.97,6381.942,6388.682,Right now you are not even asking to raise the rates as much as the inflation you are experiencing.,188,,
972,0.97,6388.682,6396.39,I wanted to know that while I vote yes today.,188,,
973,0.97,6396.39,6396.69,Thank you.,188,,
974,0.97,6396.69,6397.424,"Thank you, sir.",189,,
975,0.97,6397.424,6408.769,"I am not seeing any other questions, so I am going to move this legislation and I have some closing remarks.",190,,
976,0.97,6408.769,6411.805,I move that the committee recommends passage of Council bill 120411.,190,,
977,0.97,6411.805,6413.206,Is there a second?,190,,
978,0.97,6413.206,6416.309,Second.,191,,
979,0.97,6416.309,6419.88,It has been moved and Seconded to recommend passage of Council bill 120411.,192,,
