8,0.97,300.633,325.758,"Last week we had the final meeting of the process and I think going into the meeting, everyone was holding their breath because I do not believe we thought we'd reach 80% consensus among the group.",1,,

39,0.97,671.771,684.683,"I would say as a reminder, if there's a criminal act or Life- threatening incident occurring, call 911.",1,,
40,0.97,684.683,696.762,"For everyone else, a behavioral call or mental health, those are not calls that the police Department should be fielding because they have other higher priorities.",1,,

58,0.97,813.445,828.427,"So, moving onto my Committee report, let's just start things off with recognition that June is pride month for folks.",3,,
59,0.97,828.427,833.232,I know we'll have more to say as the month goes on.,3,,
60,0.97,833.232,836.869,Nothing on the full council agenda today.,3,,
61,0.97,836.869,842.074,We have bill 119981 regarding the Seattle police Department's budget.,3,,
62,0.97,842.074,849.849,Just want to quickly give an overview about the origins of the legislation and how it evolved.,3,,
63,0.97,849.849,857.423,"First of all, this legislation is not about the Seattle police Department budget for officer hiring.",3,,
64,0.97,857.423,863.495,The budget for officer hiring was fully funded in the 2021 budget adopted in November.,3,,
65,0.97,863.495,870.202,"Secondly, the city of Seattle, as we all know, is under a consent decree with the U.S.",3,,
66,0.97,870.202,871.27,Department of justice.,3,,
67,0.97,871.27,882.681,So any items covered under the consent decree require review and approval by the judge.,3,,
68,0.97,882.681,890.222,And a court-appointed monitor has a role in that process.,3,,
69,0.97,890.222,901.4,"So developments were not only driven by public input, council member input, SPD input, and also the Consen decree process.",3,,
70,0.97,901.4,923.355,"In August of 2020, you recall that the Council adopted resolution 31962, which stated that the city council will not support any budget amendments to increase the budget, to offset overtime expenditures above the budget for 2020 or 2021.",3,,
71,0.97,923.355,929.695,"Despite that resolution, that's not what occurred in 2020.",3,,
72,0.97,929.695,942.541,"An additional $5.4 million spending request from SPD late in the year did not align with that resolution, and Council voted to add those funds, contrary to our policy not to do so.",3,,
73,0.97,942.541,958.857,The Council stated our intent at that time to propose legislation reduced the 2021 budget by $5.4 million in order to make sure that our actions were consistent with the spirit of the resolution.,3,,
74,0.97,958.857,973.405,"After this was introduced, we heard from the judge overseeing the consent decree and he stated sharp criticism of the Council on budget issues, emphasizing that the consent decree is mandatory.",3,,
75,0.97,973.405,995.527,"The monitor noted that meeting the requirements in the decree and plan require an adequate resource for the police Department and concerns were raised over various cuts to the budget, Impacting the city's able to comply with a range of requirements in the future.",3,,
76,0.97,995.527,1016.248,"So in response, and because I'd originally stated when we introduced that $5.4 million cut legislation that I would not be rigid about the dollar amount, the Council action in my mind is not about a dollar amount.",3,,
77,0.97,1016.248,1029.194,It's about a culture of accountability and ensuring that it is understood that it is the Council who budgets for the executive departments.,3,,
78,0.97,1029.194,1042.975,"So I sponsored a revised version of the bill on March 23rd, because my objective all along has been to try to put together something that would pass the Council.",3,,
79,0.97,1042.975,1059.024,That version included $3 million in cuts to the police Department's budget with $2 million going toward budgeting and $1 million moved from SPD to other departments.,3,,
80,0.97,1059.024,1066.498,The committee acted in majority to place this version of the bill before the committee.,3,,
81,0.97,1066.498,1076.075,The bill allows for funding for civilian positions and technology requests made at the March 9th meeting.,3,,
82,0.97,1076.075,1098.597,"I also proposed additional staffing for public disclosure requests as recommended by the city auditor in the 2015 report, which has been extensively reported on by the Seattle times and called out by the Washington state public disclosure committee as problematic if left Unaddressed.",3,,
83,0.97,1098.597,1105.337,I also included funding for additional evidence storage as recommended by the inspector general.,3,,
84,0.97,1105.337,1109.908,The majority of committee members voted to substance abuse the bill with the new version.,3,,
85,0.97,1109.908,1123.422,"Soon after that, the monitor asked a series of questions of the police Department and upon receiving the reply, went to emphasize that funding levels and that funding be available for training and patrol.",3,,
86,0.97,1123.422,1131.263,"I think the comment at the time was something along the lines of, now is not the time to cut the police Department's budget.",3,,
87,0.97,1131.263,1142.708,"So in response to try and address these ongoing concerns from the monitor, I further proposed amending the bill.",3,,
88,0.97,1142.708,1175.641,"Again, we reduced the size of the cut in previous discussions and in this last round of amendments, I proposed we release a $2.5 million spending proviso for sustained misconduct of police officers, because it's not possible at this time to do out of order layoffs because of the intersection of the public civil safety service rules and state law.",3,,
89,0.97,1175.641,1183.882,So the bill indicates additional funds could be set for training and patrol as identified by the monitor.,3,,
90,0.97,1183.882,1227.259,"At the end of the day, this is a tough compromise that allows for additional spending, as the monitor emphasized, but still maintains a $3 million cut to the Seattle police Department's budget, again with the overall policy goal that we are trying to foster a culture of accountability in the police Department and a culture of fiscal oversight, as well as ensuring that it is the Council that's in the driver's seat for making budget decisions around executive departments.",3,,
91,0.97,1227.259,1244.176,"Lastly, the bill was voted out of committee with a do not pass recommendation, despite the fact that a majority of Council members, three members voted in favor of the amendment in the last committee meeting and in favor of the substitute bill.",3,,
92,0.97,1244.176,1260.659,"Because there was a do not pass recommendation from members with support, the reduction of the police Department's budget was voted.",3,,
93,0.97,1260.659,1275.273,"Moving onto other items, public health update, I'm sure folks know that in King County, public health leaders have issued a mask mandate, that everyone should wear masks indoors.",3,,
94,0.97,1275.273,1285.117,The directive will be in place until 70% of residents 18 and older are fully Vaccinated and protected.,3,,
95,0.97,1285.117,1288.153,Currently 65% of residents have received all their vaccination shots.,3,,
96,0.97,1288.153,1299.398,"If you know anyone 12 and over who's interested in getting Vaccinated, help by offering a ride, helping them find an appointment or just encouraging them to take the first step.",3,,
97,0.97,1299.398,1313.045,"Because Seattle residents have done a great job with Vaccinations, the city announced changes are coming to several sites over the month of June, winding down Vaccinations.",3,,
98,0.97,1313.045,1316.448,The first to close will be West Seattle on June 9th.,3,,
99,0.97,1316.448,1320.052,"If you have not yet been Vaccinated, now is the time.",3,,
100,0.97,1320.052,1327.659,Take advantage of free and easy City-Run vaccination sites while they're still providing vaccines.,3,,
101,0.97,1327.659,1341.106,You can walk up or make an appointment at Seattle.Gov/Vaccine or (206) 684- 2489.,3,,
102,0.97,1341.106,1345.21,"There's a Drive-Through site open Monday through Saturday, 9:00 A.M.",3,,
103,0.97,1345.21,1346.144,To 5:00 P.M.,3,,
104,0.97,1346.144,1355.087,"Throughout the summer, and the West Seattle sites will convert back to Covid testing.",3,,
105,0.97,1355.087,1365.464,"The city will continue to provide Vaccinations through the fire Department mobile vaccination teams, providing Popup clinics throughout the summer.",3,,
106,0.97,1365.464,1370.469,We're so close to reaching our 70% goal of vaccination.,3,,
107,0.97,1370.469,1376.174,Please encourage your friends and loved ones to get Vaccinated if they have not already.,3,,
108,0.97,1376.174,1384.816,"Meetings this week, I have the regional water quality committee meeting coming up this week.",3,,
109,0.97,1384.816,1409.241,"Also we'll be attending a meeting organized by community members in South ridge, and talk about the changes that Colead has driven with the help of city partners and community members around and encampment located at that site.",3,,
110,0.97,1409.241,1415.046,So looking forward to reflecting on what's been successful around that engagement on Tuesday evening.,3,,
111,0.97,1415.046,1430.195,"Lastly, just want to lift up that we have a proclamation signed today for observation of national violence awareness day.",3,,
112,0.97,1430.195,1433.365,June4Th is gun violence awareness day.,3,,
113,0.97,1433.365,1448.98,"Council member Morales last week mentioned the wear orange campaign beginning June 4TH through 6th, and the greater Seattle Moms demand action will join the city council meeting at 2:00 P.M.",3,,

161,0.97,1680.712,1692.691,"I wanted to double check about the Provisos, and if they are currently in place and the bill passes, they will all be lifted?",27,,
162,0.97,1692.691,1706.071,"Is that accurate, including the $5 million to Council President included in our proposal from last year?",27,,
163,0.97,1706.071,1709.34,"Effectively, the Provisos will be lifted.",28,,
164,0.97,1709.34,1716.047,The $5 million included on salary savings is effectively lifted.,28,,
165,0.97,1716.047,1721.186,I'll go into more in a second.,28,,
166,0.97,1721.186,1732.13,Also the $2.5 million proviso held for out of order layoffs is lifted.,28,,
167,0.97,1732.13,1760.492,Replacing Council member Gonzalez's proviso is a new one that still holds $5 million of salary savings but releases it on a monthly basis as the Department provides the Council with staffing reports.,28,,
168,0.97,1760.492,1773.538,So it would be automatically released by the end of the year be entirely in the Council's possession.,28,,
169,0.97,1773.538,1777.142,Hopefully I haven't made that too confusing.,28,,
170,0.97,1777.142,1781.312,Can I ask a follow-up question?,29,,
171,0.97,1781.312,1781.746,Sure.,30,,
172,0.97,1781.746,1794.192,I appreciate these times to ask the detailed questions.,31,,
173,0.97,1794.192,1799.831,This is helpful so thank you for making this available in committee.,31,,
174,0.97,1799.831,1803.234,"Greg, I appreciate the memos that you have sent.",31,,
175,0.97,1803.234,1810.742,I think what I'm struggling with a little bit is about the $13 million projected Underspend.,31,,
176,0.97,1810.742,1820.852,I agree with the chair that investments and making sure the public records requests that are requested of SPD need to be answered appropriately.,31,,
177,0.97,1820.852,1837.802,I also agree we need to have folks who are community resource officers to have the resources they need and there's a need for the evidence storage to be updated.,31,,
178,0.97,1837.802,1876.541,"I guess just break it down here, if they are anticipating $13 million in Underspend this year and that has nothing to do with any additional restrictions on their hiring plan, why can't they redirect that?",31,,
179,0.97,1876.541,1881.446,"I see, and no need to apologize, council member Mosqueda.",32,,
180,0.97,1881.446,1895.593,We had Greg join us in case there were questions and we recognize this is an important bill that not all Council members have had an opportunity to dive into like we have on the committee.,32,,
181,0.97,1895.593,1896.961,Go ahead.,32,,
182,0.97,1896.961,1908.273,"Those investments that you Referenced, those are investments coming from the SPD cut, going to other departments.",33,,
183,0.97,1908.273,1923.154,"Some dollars are going to Seattle I.T., and some dollars are still within the Department but being put into the office of professional police accountability.",33,,
184,0.97,1923.154,1934.999,"Much like the rest of what we maintain, what we don't cut, we are directing those dollars to be spent in those ways.",33,,
185,0.97,1934.999,1953.651,"Of the dollars related to disclosure requests, within the police Department we can direct dollars like we are proposing to direct dollars for the things in the bill that we have agreement on.",33,,
186,0.97,1953.651,1996.994,"So whether or not that comes from the big $13 million Underspend or whether or not it comes from this bill as proposed, I think it's the same outcome, because again, these are the--the $13 million Underspend is from the fewer positions than anticipated that funds are needed for.",33,,
187,0.97,1996.994,2010.475,And the $5 million proviso is also from that same source.,33,,
188,0.97,2010.475,2016.013,"Greg, you could probably clean this up for me.",33,,
189,0.97,2016.013,2027.625,At least for the Oig recommendations because those dollars go to FAS from SPD to FAS.,33,,
190,0.97,2027.625,2029.56,Some go to Seattle I.T.,33,,
191,0.97,2029.56,2032.864,And some go to the office police accountability.,33,,
192,0.97,2032.864,2047.912,"Those are not all funds that we can direct SPD to spend a particular way, because they need to go out of SPD's budget, and that's what they're proposed to do.",33,,
193,0.97,2047.912,2071.736,"Just a little bit of further explanation here, the money is their cut and sent to other departments for additional evidence space and obviously that will be something they have to spend that money on.",34,,
194,0.97,2071.736,2088.252,"The money retained in SPD, the Council bill does ask that SPD spend that money on essentially their own priorities, separation pay, technology investments and other emerging issues.",34,,
195,0.97,2088.252,2098.262,"It doesn't require that that spending happen, but it does request that SPD spend the money on things that they identify.",34,,
196,0.97,2098.262,2106.671,That's all I have.,34,,
197,0.97,2106.671,2112.643,Any other questions for Greg or Council member Herbold?,35,,
198,0.97,2112.643,2115.847,Looks like there are no other questions.,35,,
199,0.97,2115.847,2120.117,"Again, thanks Greg for being with us.",35,,
200,0.97,2120.117,2120.485,Appreciate it.,35,,
201,0.97,2120.485,2126.491,We're going to go ahead and go to Council member Juarez.,35,,
202,0.97,2126.491,2126.824,Good morning.,35,,
203,0.97,2126.824,2129.126,"Good morning, Council President.",36,,
204,0.97,2129.126,2129.961,"Good morning, colleagues.",36,,
205,0.97,2129.961,2136.934,"I want to start out and say it's good to have you back, Council President.",36,,
206,0.97,2136.934,2146.377,"Certainly send our prayers and offerings from the Indian country for you and your family, what we call not just healing but good medicine.",36,,
207,0.97,2146.377,2150.882,I want you to know that you have been in our prayers.,36,,
208,0.97,2150.882,2162.193,"I had an opportunity to do that for you in Navajo country at the grand canyon, so I just wanted you to know that.",36,,
209,0.97,2162.193,2162.393,Okay.,36,,
210,0.97,2162.393,2163.895,Let me move on here.,36,,
211,0.97,2163.895,2172.37,I want to thank Council member Pedersen for reading my notes while I was gone.,36,,
212,0.97,2172.37,2180.745,"Thank you, and I'll Venmo you what I owe you.",36,,

216,0.97,2200.831,2213.311,The agenda has been published and I encourage my colleagues to review the agenda and items corresponding.,36,,
217,0.97,2213.311,2225.089,"Item one, bill 120051, related to Seattle center sign code legislation.",36,,
218,0.97,2225.089,2232.73,Agenda item two allows for a land swap from Seattle parks and recreation to the Seattle Department of transportation.,36,,
219,0.97,2232.73,2255.853,It would transfer 3 feet of land from Seattle parks along East green Lake way and green Lake to S-Dot.,36,,
220,0.97,2255.853,2259.657,This clarifies the land is property of S-Dot.,36,,
221,0.97,2259.657,2264.161,"Then the last two, this has been going on a long time but we're getting closer.",36,,

224,0.97,2299.096,2313.577,Item three is subject to rules so I ask you to continue to refrain from engaging on anyone with individual amendments on the waterfront.,36,,
225,0.97,2313.577,2320.217,I invite everyone to learn more before the legislation moves to full council.,36,,

265,0.97,2617.881,2618.215,Good morning.,37,,
266,0.97,2618.215,2621.285,"Thank you, Madame President.",38,,
267,0.97,2621.285,2628.525,There are no items on today's agenda from my office or the select Committee on homelessness strategies and investment.,38,,
268,0.97,2628.525,2654.084,"I want to begin just by reporting back on the great community meeting that we had last week, on the work that just care, the Consrtium of providers activated in the Chinatown and Pioneer square area to address the housing, public health and public safety crises associated with Encampments in the city of Seattle.",38,,
269,0.97,2654.084,2670.401,"I want to report back on a couple of my observations, and I'm sure committee members made some as well that I would be interested in discussing over the course of this year in the Leadup to our budget conversations.",38,,
270,0.97,2670.401,2716.28,"But the cornerstone of a successful strategy for addressing sanctions on the Encampments were all provided in the presentation we have heard and the activities of just care, interpreted as a Six- month pilot program, indicating how if these practices are leaned into and expanded, we have a national best practice right in front of us to address humanely and Proactively the crisis that's affecting so many cities around Unsanctioned Encampments and the massive proliferation of homelessness, which becomes a public health, public safety and public housing problem.",38,,
271,0.97,2716.28,2723.32,I want to go through some of those corner stones.,38,,
272,0.97,2723.32,2743.14,"First, culturally competent outreach that the providers with just care were careful to select and build a perfect team to come together and really try and solve for what they can do in terms of resource delivery to help every person they conduct outreach with.",38,,
273,0.97,2743.14,2757.721,"That occurred over a period of weeks, not merely a period of days to make sure the needs of individuals can be addressed.",38,,
274,0.97,2757.721,2775.606,"Then instead of being displaced and continuing to be homelessness, people are given resources and are able to get into a place they can live with dignity and they will no longer be in a situation where they need to be camping in public.",38,,
275,0.97,2775.606,2785.682,To make sure that we have shelters that are then Resourced and meet the needs of the client.,38,,
276,0.97,2785.682,2804.902,"Ingmar Guandique this is important and has led to a lot of problems as we as a region have tried to address chronic homelessness, making sure we have resources to help with the needs people are presenting with.",38,,
277,0.97,2804.902,2831.962,"Make sure you have a Proactive Neighborhood-Based model of outreach, that it's not just a first response kind of system, but a Proactive neighborhood based Hub, where business owners in the neighborhood know who the outreach workers are, and it's based on constant communication and trust and physical Deliverables.",38,,
278,0.97,2831.962,2841.572,"People know that when you call the just care team, someone will be out there and meet with you, talk to you about the situation.",38,,
279,0.97,2841.572,2849.413,People will go and actually address the underlying issue in the encampment.,38,,
280,0.97,2849.413,2873.103,"We have heard this feedback several times from people on the panel, that in a lot of occasions there was very deep gratitude, being in a position where you could call out to the group and they would show up quickly.",38,,
281,0.97,2873.103,2883.046,"Even if they couldn't immediately resolve the problem, people felt heard and felt like there was Problem- solving to get to the bottom of the problems in the neighborhood.",38,,
282,0.97,2883.046,2889.62,I want to share a couple of the numbers.,38,,
283,0.97,2889.62,2904.534,We know it's important that one of the components that we analyze is not just the efficacy of the programs but also the cost.,38,,
284,0.97,2904.534,2922.853,"The $49,000 cost at scale, essentially under the just care model we should say the number is favorable with alternative approaches based in the traditional legal system that drive considerable costs.",38,,
285,0.97,2922.853,2947.945,"I would also note, as Victor shared with us on the provider panel, that that number does not include the estimated average savings of $27,000 per person across other emergency response systems and emergency care facilities.",38,,
286,0.97,2947.945,2963.126,So that number realizes other system savings across a variety of governments and case load counts.,38,,
287,0.97,2963.126,2980.644,"It's important to note that only about 13% of people going into the shelters were not a good fit and eventually left those shelters, roughly one in ten of the people on the case load.",38,,
288,0.97,2980.644,2997.694,"During the period monitored by Dr. Beckett, only four out of the hundreds of people here kind of service . or have any I really think we as a Council should continue our support.",38,,
289,0.97,2997.694,3025.021,"I know that everybody here has been supportive of this model and expanding this model, that we really lean in to the work that just care is doing to be responsive to the crisis we see every day in the Unaddressed public health and public safety issues with Unsanctioned Encampments in the city.",38,,
290,0.97,3025.021,3027.958,I think it's our duty to address it.,38,,
291,0.97,3027.958,3042.005,We are going to do that with the American recovery resources that will be a big part of this requisition to keep this program going to the summer of 2022 and expand it.,38,,
292,0.97,3042.005,3069.633,I think we should continue to lean into this and look at dedicated revenue streams as part of our budget process so that everybody in the city has somebody they can call and know that there will be a response to these communities who need our assistance.,38,,
293,0.97,3069.633,3083.78,"Moving on, I do want to appreciate Council member Juarez's invitation to the public to discuss several matters related to the waterfront lid, as this is something in my district.",38,,
294,0.97,3083.78,3090.587,I will accept that invitation and look forward to attending that Committee on Friday.,38,,
295,0.97,3090.587,3104.301,I appreciate the invitation because I'm not a member of that committee but those discussions have big implications for district 7. so I will be attending and look forward to that discussion.,38,,
296,0.97,3104.301,3113.543,"Finally, I want to flag that I will be at the queen Ann farmers market this week, meeting on Thursday afternoon.",38,,
297,0.97,3113.543,3124.488,"It's good to get back into farmers market season, and I know a number of my colleagues here have already been attending farmers markets in their neighborhoods.",38,,
298,0.97,3124.488,3135.632,"Just a Shoutout to the general public, I'm happy to answer any questions you may have at the farmers market, and I'll try and attend that on a regular basis.",38,,
299,0.97,3135.632,3147.511,"With that, Madame President, I don't have any additional updates.",38,,
300,0.97,3147.511,3150.747,"Thank you, council member Lewis.",39,,
301,0.97,3150.747,3156.62,Next up is Council member Morales then Council member Mosqueda.,39,,

304,0.97,3184.614,3216.646,"There is one amendment I've added this afternoon, advocating the three positions and we just want to give the Council the latitude to discuss the best way to proceed with budgeting once this is underway and investments are being made.",40,,
305,0.97,3216.646,3222.953,We have six appointments to the Lbgtq Commission and five to the music Commission.,40,,

455,0.97,5025.353,5038.767,"In last week's meeting, Councilmember Pedersen proposed four amendments to the legislation banning school year Evictions of school children and their families and educators.",50,,
456,0.97,5038.767,5060.221,"If passed, that would divide educators, excluding the lowest paid teachers from Eviction and remove the protections from school children if their landlord owns fewer than five homes.",50,,
457,0.97,5060.221,5067.762,We know bigger landlords use Llcs to hide the fact that they own many properties.,50,,
458,0.97,5067.762,5084.479,"None of the amendments were passed in Committee, and I appreciate Councilmembers Lewis and Morales.",50,,
459,0.97,5084.479,5089.851,"For the committee, the members of the public had barely any notice at all.",50,,
460,0.97,5089.851,5103.298,"So Renters can let the city council know what they feel about the amendments, both from my office and many activists on the ground.",50,,
461,0.97,5103.298,5112.273,We urge Councilmembers to vote against all these amendments.,50,,
462,0.97,5112.273,5121.449,"As I mentioned before, the Union passed a nearly unanimous resolution in support of this legislation.",50,,
463,0.97,5121.449,5131.326,"The next vote will be at the regularly scheduled time at the end of the month, June 22nd at 2:00 P.M.",50,,
464,0.97,5131.326,5157.986,"The full agenda is still being developed but it will discuss Renters' rights legislation, and requiring landlords to pay relocation assistance if they economically force tenants out with unconscionable reasons, and give Renters six months notices for rent increases.",50,,
465,0.97,5157.986,5172.967,I want to thank the work of the Seattle Renters Commission on the work they have done as well.,50,,
466,0.97,5172.967,5188.85,"As I've explained in the past, my office has sent rent control legislation to the city attorney's office for review and introduction.",50,,
467,0.97,5188.85,5220.348,"This is a very strong bill, allowing rent only to be increased by the inflation rate and eliminate serious problems in places like we have seen in California, deadly loopholes like once and existing tenant Vacates a unit and it's vacant, then the rent spikes up to at market or near market levels.",50,,
468,0.97,5220.348,5230.058,So the legislation that we have proposed that the city attorney will be reviewing includes any such loopholes.,50,,
469,0.97,5230.058,5239.334,They are also preparing legislation for commercial rent control to allow struggling small businesses to have rent control and address the problem.,50,,
470,0.97,5239.334,5256.951,"As I've said before, this would be part two of the legislation that we brought forward to the city Council and city council passed recently, to be sure that all Renters facing Evictions have the right to a lawyer to defend them in court.",50,,
471,0.97,5256.951,5292.987,"We know this is a huge problem and we need to address this to create transferable Renter history, limiting credit checks in rental histories, and this is something the Renters Commission also talked about, and to create standard lease terms to prevent abuse in leases.",50,,
472,0.97,5292.987,5298.626,Of course this is all around the movement to cancel rent and mortgage debt.,50,,
473,0.97,5298.626,5304.866,"The average debt is $4,000 or so, and the numbers keep changing over the several months.",50,,
474,0.97,5304.866,5310.571,But it's thousands of dollars for millions of renting households throughout the nation.,50,,
475,0.97,5310.571,5334.328,"So we have to make sure that working people, union members, socialists build a bill of rights including canceling rent and mortgage debt to be sure big banks, corporate landlords and property development corporations pay for the crisis, not working people.",50,,
476,0.97,5334.328,5349.477,"So the legislation that will come to the city council on June 7th, including the resolution to urge the Mayor and governor to extend the Eviction moratoriums to the end of the year is just the beginning.",50,,
477,0.97,5349.477,5369.63,We need a full bill of rights for Renters.,50,,
478,0.97,5369.63,5384.679,"And also, to be clear, these bills are not just meant as fixes to patch over temporary challenges but to address the long standing crisis.",50,,
479,0.97,5384.679,5413.674,"We know for Seattle Renters, the Affordability crisis was bad even before Covid, and now Statistics released from corporate landlord Websites show they are seeing rents shoot up even more so than they--it's even better for corporate landlords and property management than before the pandemic.",50,,
480,0.97,5413.674,5423.885,Thank you.,50,,
481,0.97,5443.738,5450.545,This is a resolution to the Mayor asking she extend the moratorium?,51,,
482,0.97,5450.545,5450.812,It is.,52,,
483,0.97,5450.812,5457.285,It's addressing both the governor and the Mayor.,52,,
484,0.97,5457.285,5491.452,Has anybody given any thought to looking at potentially very narrow language to address the fact that I think we all are hearing increasingly from small landlords around Obligatons that they have around purchase and sale agreements that they are looking to effectuate.,53,,
485,0.97,5491.452,5513.741,"I've got one small landlord that's been under a purchase and sale agreement for the sale of his home that's being rented, and he's under financial penalty for not completing it because of the inability to require the tenant to leave.",53,,
486,0.97,5513.741,5537.064,"So I'm hearing more from small landlords who are seeking to sell their properties, some that are actually like a legal agreement to sell the property and they are being penalized for not being able to execute, and others with different circumstances.",53,,
487,0.97,5537.064,5556.25,"I'm wondering whether or not, without getting specific in the resolution, there's any thought to recognizing these rather unique and specific situations that some small number of landlords are dealing with?",53,,
488,0.97,5556.25,5577.138,"I don't want to blow a hole in the Eviction moratorium, but just want to recognize that people do have individual situations and circumstances that I'm interested in trying to figure out if there's a way to consider them.",53,,
489,0.97,5577.138,5580.808,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold, for mentioning that.",54,,
490,0.97,5580.808,5584.111,This of course is just a resolution.,54,,
491,0.97,5584.111,5587.515,It's not a legal policy.,54,,
492,0.97,5587.515,5603.531,"I would say before responding directly, there might be some policies we'll need to cover the needs of genuine small landlords without putting the penalty on Renters.",54,,
493,0.97,5603.531,5635.93,"I want to signal my interest in looking at that as well, with the caveat that whatever we do has to be on the basis of actually protecting small landlords, not corporations like wind mere because during public comment, we did research on people who spoke and they were Spokespersons for huge Llcs.",54,,
494,0.97,5635.93,5645.272,"My point is as long as we make sure the policies are protecting genuinely small landlords, we actually should do that.",54,,
495,0.97,5645.272,5655.85,"Also many of them are struggling and we should make sure they are not penalized either, but it should not come at the expense of Renters.",54,,
496,0.97,5655.85,5665.926,"If you wanted to propose some language and send it to us or discuss it, I'm absolutely open to looking at that.",54,,
497,0.97,5665.926,5673.934,"As you said, without blowing a hole in the Eviction moratorium.",54,,
498,0.97,5673.934,5674.335,Okay.,55,,
499,0.97,5674.335,5680.408,Any other comments or questions on that report?,56,,
500,0.97,5680.408,5680.608,Okay.,56,,
501,0.97,5680.608,5688.249,"Hearing none, I'll go ahead and conclude this section of the report with my own briefing on the agenda.",56,,
502,0.97,5688.249,5694.255,I'll have two items on the introduction referral calendar.,56,,
503,0.97,5694.255,5705.833,"One is an appointment to the preschool committee and second was Referenced in an earlier report, legislation to be discussed on June 3RD.",56,,
504,0.97,5705.833,5724.385,"This piece of legislation is modeled after California's fair food delivery act, requiring written agreements between restaurants and bars with third- party App delivery platforms.",56,,
505,0.97,5724.385,5738.399,"We are working up this policy and doing an immense amount of stake holder engagement in advance of the introduction of this bill, and look forward to the conversation in the community economic development Committee on June 3RD.",56,,
506,0.97,5738.399,5746.674,"If you have questions about the bill, reach out to my office or directly to me.",56,,
507,0.97,5746.674,5751.145,Happy to have conversations with you about that piece of legislation.,56,,
508,0.97,5751.145,5758.552,The next meeting of the governor's education Committee is June 8th at 2:00 P.M.,56,,
509,0.97,5758.552,5764.291,"We'll have four items, including the preschool and families oversight committee.",56,,
510,0.97,5764.291,5772.933,We'll also hear and discuss appointments for the city's redistricting Commission.,56,,
511,0.97,5772.933,5792.62,And we'll have a discussion with the immigrant and refugee members then talk about K through 12 learning and Seattle promise investments in the 2019- 20 school year we missed due to the pandemic.,56,,
512,0.97,5792.62,5800.895,"If you have any questions about these, reach out to my clerk.",56,,
513,0.97,5800.895,5812.339,I don't have anything else to report relevant to my committee work but I'm happy to take any questions if there are any.,56,,
514,0.97,5812.339,5812.64,All right.,56,,
515,0.97,5812.64,5815.91,"Hearing no, colleagues, anything else?",56,,
516,0.97,5815.91,5824.084,"Seeing there are no other items of business on this morning's Council briefing agenda, we are now adjourned.",56,,
517,0.97,5824.084,5826.287,Look forward to seeing you all at 2:00.,56,,
