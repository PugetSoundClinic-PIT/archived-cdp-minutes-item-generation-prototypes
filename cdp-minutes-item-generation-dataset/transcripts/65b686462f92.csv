22,0.97,201.601,212.579,"Secondly, since this Committee is digging deeply into the process of fair elections, we might Backtrack and include the democracy vouchers.",1,,
23,0.97,212.579,228.861,"It was very Disheartening to some of the members, the voters in particular because when a council member running would not use the democracy voucher system, those were available and then they were targeted to different districts.",1,,
24,0.97,228.861,235.702,"With districts elections going on, it turns out that some of the candidates Haveed majority of their money coming from a different district.",1,,

26,0.97,236.636,244.444,I don't know if this committee can address that but I think that is a reform or something to look into that is meaningful.,1,,
27,0.97,244.444,269.836,"And then Lastly whatever legislation takes place, you guys are smart and many of you are attorneys and to make sure that these laws are Compliant with the election laws which are technical sometimes to be sure that whatever you pass actually will get enacted without any challenges, ACLU et cetera.",1,,

35,0.97,297.297,300.166,I worked on four city council campaigns.,3,,
36,0.97,300.166,306.939,I can attest the most stressful times during the candidate's race is the money.,3,,

38,0.97,311.911,314.914,With limits we can fix this.,3,,
39,0.97,314.914,320.52,"The whole process, initiative voucher program was drafted on was to get money out of politics.",3,,
40,0.97,320.52,324.957,This does the exact opposite.,3,,
41,0.97,324.957,326.759,It favors a very specific group.,3,,
42,0.97,326.759,347.613,"In 2011 ""New York times"" Op-Ed said we should in terms of curbing the democracy--citizens United, the only way that the money candidates would except to finance his or her campaign would be democracy vouchers or contributions capped at $100, no PAC money, no $2,500 checks.",3,,
43,0.97,347.613,348.181,Small contributions only.,3,,
44,0.97,348.181,355.588,If the voter didn't use the voucher the money passed to his or her party or independent back to the public funding system.,3,,
45,0.97,355.588,359.759,That is setting up a bold firm limits.,3,,
46,0.97,359.759,360.226,That is Progressive.,3,,
47,0.97,360.226,363.362,This legislation being discussed today while amended could be so much better.,3,,

59,0.97,420.019,456.022,"This is one of the ways you can fix it is to deal with campaign contribution, making it easier for people that don't have big money and don't have big money supporters to run for election having been a candidate myself I know how difficult it is to spend all your time raising money trying to be competitive with those who have more money than you do and I just am very thankful that this new Council is taking this up as one of their very first priorities.",6,,

64,0.97,475.208,498.531,"The plan was that a super PAC can be ten people and of the 10 people they can donate no more than $5,000 and I know Uber and--Uber and Airbnb have ties to foreign companies like less than 1% or whatever and they were donating to the elections.",9,,
65,0.97,498.531,520.82,"Just the fact that anybody would want to donate over 5,000 to an election and that would ultimately force their win because people would be inundated with waves of, like, commercials that will brain wash them to vote for somebody that will not be in their best interest ultimately if they are of the working class.",9,,
66,0.97,520.82,529.161,"It's a really good idea to limit it to $5,000 per person in a super PAC of 10.",9,,
67,0.97,529.161,544.477,"I know Shauna couldn't take democracy vouchers because she had to take money from other people in the country who aligned with her ideas and, so, that Nullifies democracy vouchers and makes them inept.",9,,
68,0.97,544.477,561.16,"To flex your must ask you La tore by using outlandish amounts of money from somebody who--Amazon when the workers walked out because they were protesting the climate policies, they were disciplined in a way that said reread the policy.",9,,
69,0.97,561.16,573.272,"If their policy isn't for a green economy, then I think people should walk out every Friday against them and their workers in factories.",9,,
70,0.97,573.272,576.943,What is somebody like that trying to buy our elections.,9,,
71,0.97,576.943,580.78,How would society be shaped in the laws.,9,,

79,0.97,618.651,641.841,"I have a feeling and my question is, is this more reaction to Amazon and the great amount of money they spent which my first thought was never has anybody spent so much money and got so little then I remembered some other elections in Seattle where similar things have happened before.",14,,
80,0.97,641.841,660.259,"Until you start getting the Feds, the lawyers embarrassed and the state embarrassed about the allowing of outright corruption if when this country, in other words, Shell corporations, people are not allowed to know who owns things, who really spent the money, this might be an exercise in futility.",14,,
81,0.97,660.259,671.103,I would hope that you would at least start and try to go the next step of the embarrassment that has to go further.,14,,
82,0.97,671.103,680.88,I have been most unhappy about the lowering of the degree of respect nor citizens in this city.,14,,
83,0.97,680.88,682.515,Look at the three ordinance.,14,,
84,0.97,682.515,690.923,We almost got one for the last Council but the big hold up was you didn't want developers to be subject to it.,14,,
85,0.97,690.923,697.263,I need you to stay focused on the items on the agenda --,15,,
86,0.97,697.263,698.164,Money and actions.,16,,
87,0.97,698.164,711.944,"If you don't think money and actions are tied together, then I think this is a waste of time because money seems to be very close to the actions of this Council.",16,,
88,0.97,711.944,721.253,Any entity that has zoning power typically gets the biggest amount of campaign contributions from the development industry.,16,,

96,0.97,738.604,758.023,We are a Nonpark at the San pro democracy organization that works on local and state pro democracy Agendas and legislation and we want to first of all thank Councilmember Gonzalez and their staff for all the work they have done in Championing this legislation.,18,,
97,0.97,758.023,776.842,The main reason we wanted to bring this forward is because we saw the impact of independent expenditures long before this election cycle and realize that we need to defend democracy and be at the forefront in setting limits to independent expenditures and not be afraid do this.,18,,
98,0.97,776.842,780.679,We advocated for the vouchers for a long time.,18,,
99,0.97,780.679,784.884,"In fact, fix democracy first used to be Washington public campaigns.",18,,
100,0.97,784.884,791.157,We worked to overturn the law to allow for public funding opening the door for the Seattle vouchers.,18,,
101,0.97,791.157,792.491,Public funding of campaigns is important to us.,18,,
102,0.97,792.491,796.595,We want to make sure that we defend that.,18,,
103,0.97,796.595,800.432,Independent expenditures we need to address that.,18,,
104,0.97,800.432,805.204,The vouchers were never meant to address the independent ex pen Di terse.,18,,
105,0.97,805.204,808.04,We need a separate bill.,18,,
106,0.97,808.04,818.517,We think the legislation with limits on independent expenditures and expanding discloses sure is very important to elections.,18,,
107,0.97,818.517,820.419,We know the people are behind it.,18,,
108,0.97,820.419,828.561,"When we do polling on these numbers, over 70 to 80% of the people are behind these type of--this type of legislation.",18,,
109,0.97,828.561,842.074,"So, we urge the Council to put it forward out of committee and up for a vote next week and hopefully we can be, as always, seat Abe a leader and hopefully continue to do that.",18,,

116,0.97,851.383,858.09,I am with fixed democracy first and I want to thank the Council and Councilmember Gonzalez for leadership on this.,20,,
117,0.97,858.09,879.612,"The one thing you will find agreement upon across the political spectrum in our country today is that money plays too great a role in the political system and that super PACS that can receive unlimited amounts of money, which is what makes them super have become the Achilles heel of our Dem mock I can't see.",20,,
118,0.97,879.612,880.813,Today I think--democracy.,20,,
119,0.97,880.813,889.889,Today you will hear from free speech for people who have discovered that super PACS themselves have an Achilles heel.,20,,
120,0.97,889.889,919.618,"Thanks to groups like free speech for people, League of women voters and fixed democracy Firsted, you have an opportunity to be among the first in the country to strike a blow at that Achilles heel Bypassing legislation that Limitsthe Amont that can be given to super PACS and precipitating a Supreme Court hearing on this issue which to my knowledge they have never addressed directly.",20,,
121,0.97,919.618,929.028,Association I would like you to think of this as the other half of--fixed democracy uses tools.,20,,
122,0.97,929.028,935.534,This is the other half of a pair of pliers.,20,,
123,0.97,935.534,936.835,Public funding is one side.,20,,
124,0.97,936.835,942.875,Eliminating easy ways to go around the reasonable rules for contribution limits is the other.,20,,
125,0.97,942.875,943.342,That's what this is.,20,,
126,0.97,943.342,947.78,I urge you not to pass up this opportunity.,20,,
127,0.97,947.78,948.48,It's too important.,20,,
128,0.97,948.48,956.455,It has too much potential to have national impact and what we need now really is national leadership.,20,,
129,0.97,956.455,959.425,You guys are in the position to do it.,20,,
130,0.97,959.425,961.593,"Don't hesitate, don't pass it down the road.",20,,

136,0.97,971.603,979.545,Is there any one in the audience that intended to sign up and provide public testimony but didn't have an opportunity to do so?,21,,
137,0.97,979.545,996.261,"Seeing no one, we will go ahead and close out the period of public comment and we will go ahead and move into the items of business on our agenda which are the aforementioned three bills.",21,,
138,0.97,996.261,1003.869,I will ask Vie to read the short titles of all three bills into the record for discussion.,21,,
139,0.97,1003.869,1013.545,"Agenda item one, council 11730, ordinance related to elections limiting contributions to independent expenditure for briefing and discussion.",22,,

141,0.97,1025.557,1029.528,[inaudible] or contributing to campaigns.,22,,
142,0.97,1029.528,1031.263,And--sorry.,22,,
143,0.97,1031.263,1047.146,"Agenda item 3, council bill 119732 ordinance related to political advertising and qualified public communication expanding commercial advertisers duty to maintain records regarding political advertising and qualified public communication.",22,,

145,0.97,1049.581,1055.821,We will go ahead kick off the discussion here.,24,,
146,0.97,1055.821,1057.656,We have a presentation and memo.,24,,
147,0.97,1057.656,1066.532,Introduce yourself and then we will start going through the presentation.,24,,
148,0.97,1066.532,1067.099,All right.,25,,
149,0.97,1067.099,1068.167,Council central staff.,25,,
150,0.97,1068.167,1070.736,"As mentioned, we are discussing thigh separate bills.",25,,
151,0.97,1070.736,1081.48,They were previously all part of one bill and in between the last committee meeting in December they have been split into thigh bills to be acted on separately.,25,,
152,0.97,1081.48,1085.818,I am going to talk about existing conditions.,25,,
153,0.97,1085.818,1093.959,And some of this will be familiar to Council members who were at the meeting in December.,25,,
154,0.97,1093.959,1103.402,"But spending in Seattle's elections, summary of the current campaign finance regulations and then talk about the bills individually.",25,,
155,0.97,1103.402,1113.412,There has been a significant increase in the amount of independent expenditure contribution over the last 10 years.,25,,
156,0.97,1113.412,1117.449,In 2011 there were no independent expenditures.,25,,
157,0.97,1117.449,1123.755,This past year we saw over $4 million in independent expenditures.,25,,
158,0.97,1123.755,1139.104,At the same time we have decreased contribution limits--direct contribution limits to Council members and added the democracy voucher program.,25,,
159,0.97,1139.104,1148.18,Overall the 2019 race set a record for how much was spent on Council campaigns.,25,,
160,0.97,1148.18,1159.191,And almost half of those funds were contributed to independent expenditure committees rather than to direct contributions to Council members.,25,,
161,0.97,1159.191,1168.667,"In terms of this particular slide, the data that is here is just for the city council races.",26,,
162,0.97,1168.667,1177.109,It does not include at this juncture data on the city attorney's race or the Mayoral race.,26,,
163,0.97,1177.109,1183.549,Is that information that is available to us that you could compile and create a similar chart for.,26,,
164,0.97,1183.549,1183.782,Yes.,27,,
165,0.97,1183.782,1195.027,"I was trying to keep things as simple as possible, given the change in configuration every campaign cycle of the city council races, it's difficult.",27,,
166,0.97,1195.027,1197.863,I was trying to limit the number of variables.,27,,
167,0.97,1197.863,1213.912,I would ask that you compile that information for all of the campaigns that we have seen independent expenditures for and that the democracy program applies to.,28,,
168,0.97,1213.912,1237.803,The Mayoral race isn't going to be subject Toped democracy voucher program until 2021 but I think there is data that would be helpful to the legislative record and to our thinking as policymakers particularly as the relates to bill . dependent expenditure,28,,
169,0.97,1237.803,1252.417,There--a large chunk of the independent expenditures were provided to civic Alliance for sound economy which is the PAC for the Seattle Chamber of Commerce.,29,,
170,0.97,1252.417,1276.608,"But a number of other PACS received significant funding and there are a range of different interests represented by the PACs, both business, Union, and then smaller PACS like neighborhoods for smart streets or district one neighbors for small business have localized or specific interests in the election.",29,,
171,0.97,1276.608,1293.592,"On this particular slide, is there data available from the Seattle ethics and elect Commission that tells us Whated average contribution amount is for these donations that we see to these different interests?",30,,
172,0.97,1293.592,1294.926,Yeah.,31,,
173,0.97,1294.926,1300.866,Number of contributions and the average amount of the contribution?,32,,
174,0.97,1300.866,1301.133,Yeah.,33,,
175,0.97,1301.133,1309.207,Overall--I was looking at this data.,33,,
176,0.97,1309.207,1315.414,There were 1901 contributions to PACS in 2019.,33,,
177,0.97,1315.414,1318.784,"And 95 of those were over $5,000.",33,,
178,0.97,1318.784,1319.017,Wow.,34,,
179,0.97,1319.017,1323.722,"So, 5% of them were over $5,000 and the rest under 5,000.",35,,
180,0.97,1323.722,1325.824,"The rest were under 5,000.",36,,
181,0.97,1325.824,1326.291,"5,000 or less.",37,,
182,0.97,1326.291,1326.558,Yeah.,38,,
183,0.97,1326.558,1353.218,"And then I think it would be helpful to get even more granular detail particularly those under 5,000 and if there is a way for us to analyze and evaluate if there is a correlation between volume of number of contributions and the amount of the contribution across that spectrum that would be helpful.",38,,
184,0.97,1353.218,1353.485,Yeah.,39,,
185,0.97,1353.485,1357.289,"Colleagues, feel free to signal if you have other requests for information.",39,,
186,0.97,1357.289,1391.723,"Again, when we are talking about the independent expenditure pieces in particular, we have ongoing work to do in this space so this is a good opportunity to flag some additional data or analysis that you would--as we continue to build the select Tur as to why it's important for us to implement reasonable contribution limits.",39,,
187,0.97,1391.723,1393.392,Could you repeat that STAT again.,40,,
188,0.97,1393.392,1403.435,"My staff asked you for that, too.",40,,
189,0.97,1403.435,1404.236,"What percentage were above 5,000.",40,,
190,0.97,1404.236,1407.672,"5% above 5,000.",41,,
191,0.97,1407.672,1408.874,Which is what you estimated.,42,,
192,0.97,1408.874,1433.365,"I think one of the things I would like to mention here, I am just really fully understanding is that large corporations, even Underpass Sage of this law will still be able to engage in big money spending to support candidates?",42,,
193,0.97,1433.365,1441.573,"They will still be able to make Million-Dollar political expenditures, they just won't be able to give to a PAC.",42,,
194,0.97,1441.573,1453.151,That helps me understand that this legislation is about addressing Quid pro quo corruption and the threat of it.,42,,
195,0.97,1453.151,1482.881,"We shouldn't kid ourselves that it's going to, quote, get big money out of politics because with the passage of a bill like this it's likely that we will see some of that shift where large corporations will directly Finance election activities but what we are really trying to get at is making sure that in doing so that they aren't extracting commitments from people running for office.",42,,
196,0.97,1482.881,1483.148,Right.,43,,
197,0.97,1483.148,1510.342,Strong component of transparency that I think from a policy perspective works against the appearance or the perception and actual corruption within campaigns either through independent expenditure activity or through direct contributions to campaigns and so I think that is an important point to make.,43,,
198,0.97,1510.342,1510.942,Okay.,44,,
199,0.97,1510.942,1528.293,"Of those contributions, the largest by far was the contribution by Amazon which listed national news and denunciation from candidates for President.",45,,
200,0.97,1528.293,1540.071,But we saw other organizations make large independent expenditures particularly Sciu and Nike here.,45,,
201,0.97,1540.071,1604.235,"But, again, when we go back to the total contributions of 2019 political committees, that's the slide three, if Western to dig into, for example, the contributions and the source of contributions forecast and people for Seattle which are the two big numbers on that chart, is there--is there a way for us to do that and be able to sort of get that granular detail about who those contributors are in because I think that that is a good layer of information over the second--the next slide which is would give us a better picture of who is--the actual who in terms of contributors are making the donations as opposed to organizationally who is making contributions to political expenditure activities.",46,,
202,0.97,1604.235,1611.71,"So, I have started to pull that out for these top contributors.",47,,
203,0.97,1611.71,1627.225,"Amazon, Vulcan and the Washington Association of realtors, Expedia, nap, R.C.Hendron and Hendron Holdings contributing to case.",47,,
204,0.97,1627.225,1627.926,Ufcw PAC --,47,,
205,0.97,1627.926,1631.196,That's what the color coding is.,48,,
206,0.97,1631.196,1631.429,Got it.,48,,
207,0.97,1631.429,1646.845,"And, so, when I look at this and see all the dark blue, maybe we can come up with more than just blue.",49,,
208,0.97,1646.845,1666.197,"So, the darkest blue shade, all of those donations were made to Cape and then--as it gets--the grade Yags of color changes that indicates which of those contributions is going to which political action committee.",49,,
209,0.97,1666.197,1666.464,Right.,50,,
210,0.97,1666.464,1666.731,Okay.,51,,
211,0.97,1666.731,1677.609,"But, one of the great things about Seattle's election laws, we require full disclosure of contribution to independent expenditure committees.",52,,
212,0.97,1677.609,1683.815,"We know $30 contributors to an independent expenditure Committee, we know who those contributors are.",52,,
213,0.97,1683.815,1707.205,"If I look at the Amazon.Com number of $1.5 million, are they required under current code--is Amazon under current code to disclose who contributed the $1.5 million, if it's multiple people as opposed to just the corporate entity.",53,,
214,0.97,1707.205,1715.046,The corporate entity is contributing as a corporation.,54,,
215,0.97,1715.046,1723.321,Individual executives from the corporation would be individual contributors and listed separately.,54,,
216,0.97,1723.321,1723.588,Okay.,55,,
217,0.97,1723.588,1729.561,"I probably can't identify--well, we do have some information about where contributors work.",56,,
218,0.97,1729.561,1741.606,"So, we may be able to dig down and identify where particular individual contributors are working for Amazon or not, for example.",56,,
219,0.97,1741.606,1750.548,As it Relatesto particular contributors making contributions to PACS as opposed directly to campaigns?,57,,
220,0.97,1750.548,1750.815,Right.,58,,
221,0.97,1750.815,1756.121,And we have that information for direct contributions to campaigns.,58,,
222,0.97,1756.121,1767.799,"In that 5% of giving that is above $5,000, is that by number of colors or number of contributions?",59,,
223,0.97,1767.799,1768.967,Number of dollars.,60,,
224,0.97,1768.967,1769.601,Thank you.,61,,
225,0.97,1769.601,1775.974,Can we do number of contributions as well?,62,,
226,0.97,1775.974,1776.241,Maybe.,63,,
227,0.97,1776.241,1790.321,"I think if--most contributors to independent expenditure committees make a single contribution, Amazon made three contributions over the course of the campaign cycle but generally one, maybe 2.",63,,
228,0.97,1814.212,1818.716,Individual but it can be a corporation . a Union.,63,,
229,0.97,1818.716,1821.019,A political party.,63,,
230,0.97,1821.019,1823.054,Almost anything.,63,,
231,0.97,1823.054,1834.465,"Contribution is giving something and not expect being a return for it, basically.",63,,
232,0.97,1834.465,1848.012,Political Committee is a group that intends to receive contributions or make expenditures in support of or opposition to a candidate or ballot proposition.,64,,
233,0.97,1848.012,1867.198,"There are political committees that are not super PACS that do coordinate with candidates, but a super pack or what this legislation would define as an independent expenditure Committee is one that does not coordinate with a campaign.",64,,
234,0.97,1867.198,1882.38,"And then, independent expenditure is a expenditure on behalf of or opposing a campaign when it's completely independent of the campaign and is not a contribution to that campaign.",64,,
235,0.97,1882.38,1898.229,Seattle's contribution campaign limits were adopted in 20 - 2015 with the honest elections initiative.,65,,
236,0.97,1898.229,1907.205,"For candidates that choose to participate in the democracy voucher program, the limit is $250.",65,,
237,0.97,1907.205,1908.606,"For candidates not participating, it is $500.",65,,
238,0.97,1908.606,1915.713,There are no limits on contributions to political committees under current law.,65,,
239,0.97,1915.713,1925.456,Contributions to both candidates and political committees must be disclosed and campaigns may not participate in independent expenditures.,65,,
240,0.97,1925.456,1933.364,"Seattle currently has no regulations regarding foreign contributions, but they are limited under national law.",65,,
241,0.97,1933.364,1941.272,Federal law prohibits contributions from foreign nationals and foreign principals in connection with any election.,65,,
242,0.97,1941.272,1947.378,Domestic subsidiaries of foreign contributions are eligible to contribute if the foreign parent doesn't finance election related expenditures.,65,,
243,0.97,1947.378,1957.689,"Again, there are some ways that foreign owned corporations residing in the United States can contribute to campaigns.",65,,
244,0.97,1957.689,1963.061,Or independent expenditures.,65,,
245,0.97,1963.061,1965.296,"Again, I want to go back to the slide.",66,,
246,0.97,1965.296,1968.066,I think it's really important.,66,,
247,0.97,1968.066,1982.347,"What we are, I think the nuance here is that there is existing Federal law that regulates in this space that applies to Federal election, electoral activity.",66,,
248,0.97,1982.347,1984.382,It also applies to local elections.,67,,
249,0.97,1984.382,1997.762,"But, we do not have currently in Seattle, a mechanism by which to effectively investigate and enforce whether or not those Federal laws are being upheld.",68,,
250,0.97,1997.762,1998.029,Correct?,68,,
251,0.97,1998.029,1999.197,Correct.,69,,
252,0.97,1999.197,2000.064,Okay.,70,,
253,0.97,2000.064,2026.357,"Of the really, what we are trying to do through this particular, one of the Council bills is effectively import existing prohibitions and Federal law to provide our Seattle ethics and elections Commission the tools they need to be able to both understand, investigate, and enforce current Federal law in our local elections.",70,,
254,0.97,2026.357,2026.624,Yeah.,71,,
255,0.97,2026.624,2035.166,It also goes more broadly and touches more types of foreign influence in campaigns and contributions.,71,,
256,0.97,2035.166,2050.782,By defining a percentage of how we believe foreign influence might seep into decision-making related to making electoral contribution decisions.,72,,
257,0.97,2050.782,2051.582,Right.,73,,
258,0.97,2051.582,2058.689,"Just a follow-up question Councilmember Gonzales, going on the same thing.",74,,
259,0.97,2058.689,2061.159,Just so I understand correctly as well.,74,,
260,0.97,2061.159,2081.679,"My understanding is that there is still at the Federal level, a loophole where a Federal, where a pack that is mostly funded by a company that may be owned by a foreign company can still, under federal law and that is allowed, have a pack.",74,,
261,0.97,2081.679,2083.147,And this ordinance would close that loophole.,74,,
262,0.97,2083.147,2086.317,Is that a correct understanding?,74,,
263,0.97,2086.317,2088.586,"Yeah, I think that's correct.",75,,
264,0.97,2088.586,2098.896,"In that respect, it would also broaden the prohibitions on the foreign influence's corporation, interfering in local politics through a PAC?",76,,
265,0.97,2098.896,2099.097,Okay.,76,,
266,0.97,2099.097,2101.933,Thank you.,76,,
267,0.97,2101.933,2104.735,Wish?,77,,
268,0.97,2104.735,2132.463,"In terms of - advertising, commercial advertisers, companies that accept money to advertise in the political realm, required to maintain documents and books of account under current city law . It needs to include names and addresses of persons Lacing an advertisement.",78,,
269,0.97,2132.463,2134.866,"The nature and extent of the advertisement, cost and method of payment.",78,,
270,0.97,2134.866,2143.841,"These regulations only apply to campaigns, not legislative activity or anything that happens outside of sort of two years of the campaign period.",78,,
271,0.97,2143.841,2156.787,"They must be open for public inspection during normal business hours . and, during the election and for at least 3 years after the election.",78,,
272,0.97,2156.787,2169.8,"As you may have read, there has been difficulty actually seeing those records for some organization, companies, accepting political advertising over the last couple of years.",78,,
273,0.97,2169.8,2171.869,"So, this is a existing framework.",79,,
274,0.97,2171.869,2172.77,Right.,80,,
275,0.97,2172.77,2173.271,Okay.,81,,
276,0.97,2173.271,2184.215,"And then, moving to penalties for breaking these laws.",82,,
277,0.97,2184.215,2190.288,The ethics and elections Commission has the authority to levy civil penalties.,82,,
278,0.97,2190.288,2209.006,"Up to $5000, and return of the contribution . for an illegal contribution, the penalty can be the greater of either two times a contribution amount, or $5000 and return of the contribution.",82,,
279,0.97,2209.006,2209.473,Illegal contribution.,82,,
280,0.97,2209.473,2212.71,Councilman her bold?,83,,
281,0.97,2212.71,2213.311,Thank you.,84,,
282,0.97,2213.311,2233.164,"You mentioned just a moment ago that there has been some difficulty in confirming compliance with the transparency part of this, of current regulations, and being able to review the books.",84,,
283,0.97,2233.164,2241.472,"Given that there are civil penalties, already in the existing law, can you just talk a little bit more about why that is?",84,,
284,0.97,2241.472,2248.379,I'm not sure why the companies like Facebook have had a hard time -,85,,
285,0.97,2248.379,2254.552,"I mean, why have we not enforce those regulations.",86,,
286,0.97,2254.552,2256.787,"So, our laws mirrors state laws on this issue.",87,,
287,0.97,2256.787,2268.099,"And, the state has been enforcing the regulations on those and has brought those companies to court.",87,,
288,0.97,2268.099,2275.473,"So, it has been proceeded at the state level rather than the local level.",87,,
289,0.97,2275.473,2276.674,I have a follow-up question.,88,,
290,0.97,2276.674,2277.308,Councilmember Lewis.,89,,
291,0.97,2277.308,2281.178,"With this new ordinance, how big is our departure from that state regulatory framework?",90,,
292,0.97,2281.178,2296.127,In would would be in a space where there is things that only we can enforced under the municipal code now and that we can't rely on the state to enforce?,90,,
293,0.97,2296.127,2296.594,Yeah.,91,,
294,0.97,2296.594,2303.634,"So, the proposed commercial advertising bill would divide more detail about what needs to be retained.",91,,
295,0.97,2303.634,2339.27,"So, if a commercial Advertiser retains something is in compliance with the more general regulations that we just talked about, the names and addresses of the persons placing an advertisement, nature and extent of advertising, cost and method of payment, but for example, does not include a copy of the advertisement, which is one of the things that would be required under the legislation, then they would be in violation of the city law and not the state law.",91,,
296,0.97,2339.27,2339.837,Thank you.,92,,
297,0.97,2339.837,2355.286,"And I think just to put a finer point on that, nothing in this bill would preclude the state from doing their own investigation on either parallel or subsequent track, correct?",93,,
298,0.97,2355.286,2355.686,Correct.,94,,
299,0.97,2355.686,2356.287,Okay.,95,,
300,0.97,2356.287,2368.833,"So, our proposal in this ordinance would simply create stricter requirements than what currently exists under state law?",95,,
301,0.97,2368.833,2369.767,Right.,96,,
302,0.97,2369.767,2373.371,Councilmember Herbold.,97,,
303,0.97,2373.371,2403.033,"Given that ethics and elections is currently using its authority to enforce and is instead deferring to the state's ability to enforce, I would love, wish, if you can get more information from ethics and elections about whether these changes would result in their being more active in enforcement, rather than deferring to the state.",98,,
304,0.97,2403.033,2412.777,"One thing we have not heard from the ethics and elections Commission, and it is reflected in the fiscal NOTE for at least a couple of the bills, is that in order to enforce these bills, they probably will need more investigators.",99,,
305,0.97,2412.777,2413.511,"That, too.",100,,
306,0.97,2413.511,2425.256,"So, you should consider potentially adding another position there to help to enforce these legislation.",101,,
307,0.97,2425.256,2429.727,In addition to what's already listed in the fiscal NOTE?,102,,
308,0.97,2429.727,2431.862,No.,103,,
309,0.97,2431.862,2433.464,At the level listed in the fiscal no.,103,,
310,0.97,2433.464,2434.532,That's what I thought.,104,,
311,0.97,2434.532,2443.274,My recollection was that the fiscal NOTE takes into account the expressed need by the Commission for additional resources for investigations.,104,,
312,0.97,2443.274,2449.947,"So, sounds like we don't need to add more than what is currently there at this point.",104,,
313,0.97,2449.947,2450.848,Right.,105,,
314,0.97,2450.848,2451.148,Right.,105,,
315,0.97,2451.148,2451.982,Okay.,106,,
316,0.97,2451.982,2452.383,Okay.,107,,
317,0.97,2452.383,2456.987,"So, moving on to the three campaigns acts.",107,,
318,0.97,2456.987,2469.2,The first one - 119730 addresses independent expenditures.,107,,
319,0.97,2469.2,2475.472,"It defines independent expenditure committee as a political committee that intends to make, or that does make independent expenditures.",107,,
320,0.97,2475.472,2485.382,And it places a limit on contributions to independent expenditure committees of $5000.,107,,
321,0.97,2485.382,2492.923,It also creates a new category of clinical committee called the limited contributor committee.,107,,
322,0.97,2492.923,2503.534,These are committees that receive a large number of small dollar contributions.,107,,
323,0.97,2503.534,2505.97,"Less than $500, or from another limited contributor committee.",107,,
324,0.97,2505.97,2513.777,"And, from a larger number of persons.",107,,
325,0.97,2513.777,2523.654,"So, at least 150 persons for a district Council race and up to 600 persons for limited contributor committees that want to make a contribution in the context of a Mayoral race.",107,,
326,0.97,2523.654,2539.136,"And, there would be no limits contributions from these Lcc's to other monocle committees.",107,,
327,0.97,2539.136,2544.074,"At the last committee meeting, we discussed incentive amendments to the limited contributor committee idea.",108,,
328,0.97,2544.074,2576.106,"Setting a limit on contributions from Lcc sent $10,000, compared to the $5000 that other persons would be held to, required requiring limited contributor committees that meet the definition and lowering both the monetary amount and the number of persons contributing to the committee that defined the committee.",108,,
329,0.97,2576.106,2581.312,Any questions about the proposed amendment colleagues?,109,,
330,0.97,2581.312,2581.579,Okay.,109,,
331,0.97,2581.579,2595.726,"So, this is an amendment that we need to make a motion and a second to adopt and include in the base legislation correct, Lish?",109,,
332,0.97,2595.726,2596.06,Correct.,110,,
333,0.97,2596.06,2607.738,"Colleagues, I will just say on this particular amendment, we had a pretty robust conversation about it at the December 16 meeting of my committee last year.",111,,
334,0.97,2607.738,2611.408,I recognize that some of you were not here for that.,111,,
335,0.97,2611.408,2616.213,"But, effectively, what we are trying to do here from a policy perspective is twofold.",111,,
336,0.97,2616.213,2651.448,"One is create an opportunity to recognize that when we are talking about the appearance of corruption, or the perception of corruption, it is important for us to acknowledge that there is at least nationally, information that tells us that when the contributions are large from a small volume of people, that that does have a negative impact, in terms of people believing that corruption has seeped into the electoral democratic process.",111,,
337,0.97,2651.448,2673.804,"So, the theory behind the limited contributor Committee is to recognize that if the true intent here is to address the parents and appearance of corruption we need to provide a model by which large volume of donors at a small dollar amount are still allowed to engage in this political activity.",111,,
338,0.97,2673.804,2677.307,"But, in a manner that doesn't create that perception of corruption.",111,,
339,0.97,2677.307,2689.219,"So, I have really sort of struggled with where to set the number, in terms of how to qualify for limited contributor committee.",111,,
340,0.97,2689.219,2710.541,"And to have landed on thinking that instead of having a $500 or less contribution, that it would be wiser for us, in terms of addressing that appearance of corruption, concern, to lower the contribution amount to $100 or less for each person who is contributing.",111,,
341,0.97,2710.541,2736.967,"Likewise, making sure that we can see from Lcc's that they are supported by a larger volume of people is important, so, we have set the number at 100 and have standardized that number for all of the races it would apply to.",111,,
342,0.97,2736.967,2741.171,"So, District Council races, At- large Council races, city attorney races and Mayoral races would all be under the same standard.",111,,
343,0.97,2741.171,2758.288,I think that will help to bolster the Commission's ability to just standardize how they are going to enforce and investigate this particular component of the legislation.,111,,
344,0.97,2758.288,2777.508,"And it will also, again, meet the policy demands of wanting to really make sure that we are still acknowledging that there is a lesser concern as it relates to the appearance of corruption when we are talking about political activity that is being fueled by small dollar donations from a large number, large volume of people.",111,,
345,0.97,2777.508,2785.282,"So, that is where the 100 by 100 model came from, from my perspective, to be able to do this.",111,,
346,0.97,2785.282,2797.027,"The second component that I would say is motivating this particular amendment is around, you will notice that there is a limit on contributions from Lcc's.",111,,
347,0.97,2797.027,2797.494,"To $10,000.",111,,
348,0.97,2797.494,2818.348,"Originally we had introduced a bill that would, once you qualify as an Lcc, there would be no limits to the Lcc, and terms of contributions at Lcc's could make other political committees who are engaging in independent expenditures.",111,,
349,0.97,2818.348,2845.842,"We had heard concerns from ethics and election Commission as well as advocates in this campaign finance reform space, that that could be an exception that swallowed the rule and the intent that we were trying to get at, which was again, limiting political committee contributions in a way that would truly and meaningfully address the Quid pro quo corruption concerns and appearance of corruption.",111,,
350,0.97,2845.842,2864.895,"So, as a result of that, I have moved from having no limits, once you qualify as an Lcc, to having a limit, but the limit would be at $10,000, as opposed to the $5000 limit that would apply to Non-Lcc qualified committees.",111,,
351,0.97,2864.895,2893.624,"So, that is in a nutshell, the motivation, the intent behind this particular amendment, counsel the 119730, and Lish was nodding as I was speaking, so I assume I have accurately described the policy as it is reflected in the amendment, but Lish, let me know if I have Mischaracterized anything.",112,,
352,0.97,2893.624,2904.868,The only other thing to add is that requiring the committees to certify that they meet the definition will make it much easier for the ethics and elections Commission to enforce the regulations.,113,,
353,0.97,2904.868,2918.715,"So, similar to some obligations that exist in other places in legislation, particularly around the foreign influence operations, we are shift in the burden to the people engaging in the political activity to provide us with the certification under the penalty of perjury.",114,,
354,0.97,2918.715,2941.271,"That they in fact meet the definitions here, I think really cleans up the ability for the Commission to be able to do enforcement without potentially stepping into other privacy concerns that will exist from a very diverse set of Stakeholders.",114,,
355,0.97,2941.271,2944.675,"Any questions, comments, concerns?",115,,
356,0.97,2944.675,2950.447,Councilmember Herbold.,115,,
357,0.97,2950.447,2995.125,"I was a person who at the last committee meeting needed some time with this amendment after receiving several briefings on the intent, and the you know, the wisdom really of lowering the contribution limit in order to ensure that these limited contributor committees are entities that aren't able to basically create a new loophole . I am much more comfortable with this proposed change to the legislation that I was last time.",116,,
358,0.97,2995.125,2999.996,"I believe we are not going to vote this bill out of committee, but is it your intent to vote on the amendments?",116,,
359,0.97,2999.996,3013.81,"Yeah, I would like to have the amendment incorporated into the base legislation, even though I won't be moving at this point to vote this particular bill out of committee today.",117,,
360,0.97,3013.81,3014.211,Okay.,118,,
361,0.97,3014.211,3023.754,Any other questions or concerns for us to address before I move the amendment?,118,,
362,0.97,3023.754,3024.087,Okay.,118,,
363,0.97,3024.087,3028.058,I'm going to move amendment 1 to cancel the 119730 as described.,118,,
364,0.97,3028.058,3028.458,Second.,119,,
365,0.97,3028.458,3029.926,It has been moved and Seconded.,120,,
366,0.97,3029.926,3032.462,All those in favor say aye.,120,,
367,0.97,3032.462,3032.729,Aye.,121,,
368,0.97,3032.729,3033.83,Any opposed?,122,,
369,0.97,3033.83,3035.332,No opposition.,122,,
370,0.97,3035.332,3046.209,"So, the motion carries, and the amendment 1 to counsel bill 9730 passes and will be incorporated into the base legislation.",122,,
371,0.97,3046.209,3054.251,"So, before we moved, I know we are getting set to shift gears into the next counsel bill.",122,,
372,0.97,3054.251,3076.773,"Again, I just really want to clarify that we have some additional work to do, to be able to continue to develop the legislative record as it relates to this particular counsel bill 119730, which specifically relates to political committee activity or super PACS as we have been commonly referring to them.",122,,
373,0.97,3076.773,3084.081,I was hoping that we would be able to have that legislative record much better built by now.,122,,
374,0.97,3084.081,3087.517,"But Unfortunately, a lot more questions have come up.",122,,
375,0.97,3087.517,3128.992,"And, including by some of our newest Councilmembers, and really appreciate the immediate engagement on the policy issues here, and I think we would all benefit from having just a little bit more time to develop that legislative record to make sure that we have any pending legal questions answered, and then Lastly, to continue to engage in some Stakeholder engage - additional Stakeholder engagement with, particularly with individuals who are going to be directly impacted by this new framework of laws, once a pass.",122,,
376,0.97,3128.992,3168.198,"So, I am hoping that, for the first quarter of this year, we will be able to do all of those three things and be able to build the legislative record, make sure that we have all those legal questions answered for us as policymakers, and then complete Stakeholder engagement so that first thing in quarter 2, we are all in a position to feel extremely comfortable about the Defensibility of what we are doing and why we are doing it and that we have a clear, Statures established legislative record of facts that support a policy making decisions.",122,,
377,0.97,3168.198,3184.481,"So, we know that any time we challenge the status quo, and power, and the systems of power, there will be individuals who will react negatively to that, so, we want to be in the best position to defend our actions.",122,,
378,0.97,3184.481,3200.597,"And I believe that the evidence exists and the record will be able to be built to really hit the nail on the head that what we are doing here is addressing corruption, and the appearance and perception of current corruption in our here are elections.",122,,
379,0.97,3200.597,3204.167,And that is a worthy challenge to take up at the city council.,122,,
380,0.97,3204.167,3208.104,"So, we will not be voting this bill out.",122,,
381,0.97,3208.104,3208.838,It has been amended.,122,,
382,0.97,3208.838,3215.478,I am extremely grateful to Councilmember Herbold who will continue this work in the first quarter.,122,,
383,0.97,3215.478,3223.853,"To, along with my staff, to accomplish all of those things I am out of maternity leave.",122,,
384,0.97,3223.853,3224.854,Today is my last day.,122,,
385,0.97,3224.854,3229.326,In the office before I head out and have a baby.,122,,
386,0.97,3229.326,3238.868,"So, I am really appreciative to you, Councilmember Herbold for agreeing to see this piece of the work over the finish line.",122,,
387,0.97,3238.868,3244.541,"So, with that being said, are there any questions about the process related to this particular counsel bill?",122,,
388,0.97,3244.541,3245.308,Great.,122,,
389,0.97,3245.308,3253.416,"So, we will move now into the second counsel bill, which is 119731 related to foreign's influence corporations.",122,,
390,0.97,3253.416,3261.591,I do intend to call this one to vote and vote it out of committee for consideration by full Council on Monday.,122,,
391,0.97,3261.591,3263.26,Lish?,122,,
392,0.97,3263.26,3264.461,All right.,123,,
393,0.97,3264.461,3283.58,"So, counsel bill 119731 addresses corporations that have significant foreign ownership that is at a level where it could influence decisions about political contributions.",123,,
394,0.97,3283.58,3296.126,And the key definition is in the middle of the page foreign influence corporation is defined as having a single foreign owner that owns 1% or more of the corporation.,123,,
395,0.97,3296.126,3301.564,Two or more foreign owners that include 5% or more of the corporation.,123,,
396,0.97,3301.564,3308.505,And/or a foreign owner that participates directly or indirectly in corporate decision-making regarding political activities.,123,,
397,0.97,3308.505,3342.672,"I should mention that the December, I think 3RD meeting of the gender equity Committee, we heard expert testimony from Ellen WEintraub, from the Federal elections Commission, and Harvard professor who indicated that these were appropriate limits in terms of threshold where a corporation is being influenced by an owner.",124,,
398,0.97,3342.672,3354.05,"So, the bill would state that foreign influenced corporations would not be permitted to contribute to campaigns for elected office.",125,,
399,0.97,3354.05,3360.356,"Make independent expenditures, or contribute to independent expenditure committees.",125,,
400,0.97,3360.356,3372.469,"Corporations that do want to make a contribution to a campaign, make it independent expenditure or contribute to an independent expenditure committee would be required to certify that they are not foreign influence.",125,,
401,0.97,3372.469,3384.714,"Lish, have we done any sort of look back analysis of the corporations that have contributed to political campaigns? What percentage of them would be impacted by a bill like this?",126,,
402,0.97,3384.714,3385.115,No.,127,,
403,0.97,3385.115,3391.387,Is that something that is possible to do before full council?,128,,
404,0.97,3391.387,3394.324,"Or, would that just be too exhaustive of a task?",128,,
405,0.97,3394.324,3403.199,"So, that -",129,,
406,0.97,3403.199,3404.868,Over just don't have that information?,130,,
407,0.97,3404.868,3406.269,"Yeah, we probably could find the information.",131,,
408,0.97,3406.269,3414.344,"But, it is a whole new area of disclosure that I probably couldn't get that done this week.",131,,
409,0.97,3414.344,3414.944,All right.,132,,
410,0.97,3414.944,3423.52,"Just given, I don't know how ownership records for corporations are -",133,,
411,0.97,3423.52,3423.987,Understood.,134,,
412,0.97,3423.987,3424.354,Understood.,134,,
413,0.97,3424.354,3424.721,Constructed.,135,,
414,0.97,3424.721,3425.755,May I ask a question?,136,,
415,0.97,3425.755,3431.427,This applies also to ballot measures.,136,,
416,0.97,3431.427,3432.362,No.,137,,
417,0.97,3432.362,3433.363,Okay.,138,,
418,0.97,3433.363,3435.031,Thank you.,138,,
419,0.97,3435.031,3449.879,"That is a good question, Councilmember Peterson, that none of the three bills would apply to ballot measures.",139,,
420,0.97,3449.879,3472.702,"Foreign influenced corporations, you will see that there is, there was some language included that would, that would apply here in the foreign influence corporation space that would say that foreign influenced corporations just can't make contributions directly to campaigns, just like independent expenditure contributions.",139,,
421,0.97,3472.702,3473.67,"So, that would be new.",139,,
422,0.97,3473.67,3480.076,We are seeing a way for ballot initiatives at this juncture.,140,,
423,0.97,3480.076,3501.931,"Vedral courts have determined that, while a foreign person can't participate through direct contributions or independent expenditures, or through direct contributions, they may make statements on issues of political interest.",141,,
424,0.97,3501.931,3505.835,"So, we are trying to avoid any issue like that.",141,,
425,0.97,3505.835,3511.808,Thank you.,142,,
426,0.97,3511.808,3517.747,All right.,143,,
427,0.97,3517.747,3518.548,Was or just -,143,,
428,0.97,3518.548,3519.148,That's it.,144,,
429,0.97,3519.148,3520.75,There was just one there.,145,,
430,0.97,3520.75,3521.651,All right.,145,,
431,0.97,3521.651,3523.786,Catching up after stepping out for just a minute.,145,,
432,0.97,3523.786,3524.988,Okay.,145,,
433,0.97,3524.988,3535.031,"So, any other questions or concerns colleagues about the foreign's influence corporations bill?",145,,
434,0.97,3535.031,3535.431,All right.,145,,
435,0.97,3535.431,3537.467,"So, I am going to call this one to vote.",145,,
436,0.97,3537.467,3542.138,"So, I will move that the committee recommends passage of counsel bill 119731.",145,,
437,0.97,3542.138,3542.572,Second.,146,,
438,0.97,3542.572,3544.04,It has been moved and Seconded.,147,,
439,0.97,3544.04,3547.377,Are there any further comments or discussion?,147,,
440,0.97,3547.377,3547.644,Okay.,147,,
441,0.97,3547.644,3551.247,"So, hearing none, those in favor of the committee recommending passage of the bill vote aye",147,,
442,0.97,3551.247,3553.082,Aye.,148,,
443,0.97,3553.082,3554.284,Any opposed?,149,,
444,0.97,3554.284,3554.651,Any extensions?,149,,
445,0.97,3554.651,3564.594,Motion carries and the committee will recommend passage of counsel bill 119731 for this January 13 at the full city council meeting.,149,,
446,0.97,3564.594,3568.498,Thank you.,149,,
447,0.97,3568.498,3576.472,"And, we will now move to the next bill, which is regarding political advertising 119732.",150,,
448,0.97,3576.472,3584.614,"So, this bill also introduces a new term, qualified public communication.",151,,
449,0.97,3584.614,3589.585,It is defined as a paid advertisement that is intended to influence political decisions.,151,,
450,0.97,3589.585,3595.024,"In relation to a statement I just made, it is not prohibiting those paid advertisements.",151,,
451,0.97,3595.024,3605.335,"It is just requiring that a, that advertisers keep information on the books about who is making the statements.",151,,
452,0.97,3605.335,3609.606,"So, it is requiring some disclosure regarding the statements, but not providing any limits on them.",151,,
453,0.97,3609.606,3623.753,Commercial advertisers would be required to maintain documents and books of account for qualified public communications for four years after the communication occurs.,152,,

458,0.97,3649.646,3665.595,"So, accept this sort of listed here, these requirements apply for commercial advertising, both for campaigns and for qualified public communications related to legislative act's.",152,,
459,0.97,3665.595,3667.63,Outside the campaign.,152,,
460,0.97,3667.63,3669.298,Councilmember Herbold.,153,,
461,0.97,3669.298,3685.581,"So, under the 2008 lobbyist registration law, there are some disclosure related requirements related to legislative actions of the Council, and I believe of the executive as well.",154,,
462,0.97,3685.581,3699.729,"So, this bill enhances some of the requirements around issue based legislative lobbying.",154,,
463,0.97,3699.729,3702.799,"But, as I understand it, it is only during an election.",154,,
464,0.97,3702.799,3710.94,"So, why would we not want to have those enhanced transparency requirements year round?",154,,
465,0.97,3710.94,3713.476,Specifically for the issue based legislative lobbying?,154,,
466,0.97,3713.476,3732.261,"What this bill does, is it actually does apply regulations that we currently apply during the election process to other types of political advertising outside the election process.",155,,
467,0.97,3732.261,3746.476,"So, I think it does exactly what you suggested, that the qualified communication is not in election related activity is an activity all the rest of the four year cycle, when our two year cycle -",155,,
468,0.97,3746.476,3749.579,"So, that requirement is Year- round?",156,,
469,0.97,3749.579,3758.721,"It is not triggered for issue based lobbying, legislative lobbying during an election cycle?",156,,
470,0.97,3758.721,3759.088,Right.,157,,
471,0.97,3759.088,3759.489,Okay.,158,,
472,0.97,3759.489,3760.69,I Miss read an earlier memo.,158,,
473,0.97,3760.69,3761.19,Appreciate that.,158,,
474,0.97,3761.19,3761.757,Tank you.,158,,
475,0.97,3761.757,3839.268,"And that is a big shift, both in the sense that it would apply to issue related advocacy, and that it is, a change around it applying year-round are two significant changes in this space in addition to requiring some additional information be retained by the commercial Advertiser for purposes of understanding what their activity is to bolster transparency in this space . I felt that it was really important to make sure to include all of those three components . particularly the one around issue related lobbying we saw during the debate around the employee hours tax in particular, if you recall Councilmember Herbold, that there were some mollified public - would have been considered qualified public communications and paid advertisement to influence political opinion around that policy that were being posted pretty actively on line and through other Digital social media platforms with no disclosures to tell people who was funding them.",159,,
476,0.97,3839.268,3851.614,"And, ultimately, very little requirement to disclose to the Commission, much less to the public, who was funding them, at what level they were being funded, and why.",159,,
477,0.97,3851.614,3881.978,"So, I felt it was really important to make sure that if that activity was going to occur, which I expect it will continue to occur, that in the minimum, we are requiring a level of transparency that really allows the person who is receiving the message and being targeted by the message to understand who they are being targeted by.",159,,
478,0.97,3881.978,3885.815,And to require them to retain information in a way that will really promote transparency in our electoral process.,159,,
479,0.97,3885.815,3915.044,"So, that's the motivation behind this change, which seems small in the grand scheme and scale of things, but really will go a long way towards adding transparency to how political advertisements communicate information to the general public . not only about candidates and campaigns, but also about legislative priorities that the city is advancing through its legislative process.",159,,
480,0.97,3915.044,3925.221,Any questions or comments on this one?,159,,
481,0.97,3925.221,3925.721,All right.,159,,
482,0.97,3925.721,3928.658,"So, seeing none, I do intend to move this one out of committee as well.",159,,
483,0.97,3928.658,3930.293,There are no amendments for us to consider.,159,,
484,0.97,3930.293,3933.162,"So, I will move the committee recommend passage of counsel bill 119732.",159,,
485,0.97,3933.162,3933.562,Second.,160,,
486,0.97,3933.562,3935.164,It has been moved and Seconded.,161,,
487,0.97,3935.164,3938.868,Other any other further comments on the bill?,161,,
488,0.97,3938.868,3942.204,"Hearing none, those in favor of the committee recommending passage of the bill vote aye",161,,
489,0.97,3942.204,3943.072,Aye,162,,
490,0.97,3943.072,3947.777,Those opposed vote no.,163,,
491,0.97,3947.777,3948.611,And there are no Abstentions.,163,,
492,0.97,3948.611,3961.19,The motion carried to the city will recommend passage of counsel the 119732 to be considered at the January 13 city council meeting.,163,,
493,0.97,3961.19,3961.691,"Okay, colleagues.",163,,
494,0.97,3961.691,3963.259,That was the last item on our Genda.,163,,
495,0.97,3963.259,3963.793,Look at that.,163,,
496,0.97,3963.793,3964.794,Record time.,163,,
497,0.97,3964.794,3969.098,It is only 10:36.,163,,
498,0.97,3969.098,3973.402,I am just Flabbergasted at how quickly that went.,163,,
499,0.97,3973.402,3979.041,"So, I really want to thank you all for your engagement, particularly the newer Councilmembers.",163,,
500,0.97,3979.041,3988.818,I know that you all are jumping in and really sort of grappling with the policy issues here.,163,,
501,0.97,3988.818,4014.91,"I do believe that the two counsel bills that we voted out of committee today are pretty straightforward and simple, and have a broad consensus and support, both among Stakeholders and here in city council . I do think that the first counsel bill related to independent expenditures while in theory and principle, there is loss of support for it, there are still some unanswered questions, as I summarized moments ago.",163,,
502,0.97,4014.91,4022.918,"And, believe that we could benefit from a little bit more time and hope that you all agreed with that.",163,,
503,0.97,4022.918,4032.161,"So, I do want to apologize to my friends over at fixed democracy for not being able to get that out of committee now.",163,,
504,0.97,4032.161,4040.169,"But, I think that again, we want to, it is more important to get it right then to just get it done.",163,,
505,0.97,4040.169,4041.17,And we will get it done.,163,,
506,0.97,4041.17,4054.216,"And when we get it done, we will feel very, very strongly about the work product that comes out of this Committee.",163,,
507,0.97,4054.216,4060.89,"So, really appreciate your all's flexibility and willingness to continue to work with us and to understand what we are trying to ultimately accomplish and appreciate the ongoing support and engagement with us.",163,,
