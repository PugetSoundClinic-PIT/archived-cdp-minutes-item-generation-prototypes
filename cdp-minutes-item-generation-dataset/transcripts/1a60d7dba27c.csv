53,0.97,188.888,210.543,The ordinance itself is something that will strip grocery workers of hazard pay three years earlier than was determined by the ordinance that offered hazard pay to grocery workers last year.,29,,
54,0.97,210.543,221.354,Hazard pay ordinance the council passed last year required big grocery workers to pay workers an additional $4.00 an hour in hazard pay for the dangers they undertake doing essential work during the pandemic.,29,,
55,0.97,221.354,228.261,Their work brings them into contact with so many people throughout the day every day.,29,,
56,0.97,228.261,236.235,The hazard pay ordinance lasted three years until the end of the public health emergency.,29,,
57,0.97,236.235,247.547,"The public health emergency is not over yet and I think it is absolutely premature to talk about stripping the hazard pay, or stripping is essential workers of their hazard pay.",29,,
58,0.97,247.547,250.383,I do not agree with that.,29,,
59,0.97,250.383,256.089,I don't think it is late enough in August either.,29,,
60,0.97,256.089,262.595,I would like to tell members of the public what my position is.,29,,
61,0.97,262.595,270.903,Holding it is the least thing that should be done . We should at least maintain the hazard pay for the originally determined three years.,29,,
62,0.97,270.903,283.816,"If Councilmembers agree with me, we can just vote no on stripping grocery workers of hazard pay altogether and keep the original three here requirement.",29,,
63,0.97,283.816,287.587,Thank you.,29,,

132,0.97,645.077,648.314,Last year we have seen the repeated failures of every aspect of our police accountability system.,64,,
133,0.97,648.314,658.024,They held a rare once in six years public forum in February to solicit input on how police complaints should be investigated and promptly voted not to do with the community demanded.,64,,
134,0.97,658.024,671.103,We have seen police accountability Handout meaningless discipline in over 99% of the police abuse cases in the last year.,64,,
135,0.97,671.103,693.826,"Last year we witness the latest failure of the system as the officer of Inspector General released their first findings on police abuse from a 12 member panel that included 7 people that are part of the system including five SPD officers, four of whom had decades of questionable claims against them and only one member that identified as a Protester.",64,,
136,0.97,693.826,700.533,It is as if the city held a piece circle for domestic violence victims.,64,,
137,0.97,700.533,703.769,"This demonstrates the need for full community control over police policy, misconduct, and discipline.",64,,
138,0.97,703.769,705.237,Go to Seattle stop --,64,,
139,0.97,705.237,710.643,"Next up, Shelby Handler.",65,,

142,0.97,717.016,717.416,Hi there.,65,,
143,0.97,717.416,737.269,"My name is Shelby Handler and I am a Jewish resident calling from district to, calling in strong support of CB 12142, calling on city Council to support legislation to prohibit SPD from training with all countries that are committing grave, ongoing human rights abuses.",65,,
144,0.97,737.269,752.151,Our city needs to stop spending resources on supporting violations of international law and instead we should put our investments in black led solutions for safety.,65,,
145,0.97,752.151,756.489,"As a Jewish resident, I really want to say this loud and clear.",65,,
146,0.97,756.489,759.225,When we resist white supremacy we are resisting anti-Semitism.,65,,
147,0.97,759.225,782.815,"Don't let anyone tell you otherwise . I know I feel deep in my body when we invest in communities that are most impacted by these systems it makes all of us more safe, including Jewish folks of all races . We need to stop investing in racist and Militarized policing . Thank you so much.",65,,

149,0.97,783.616,788.621,Up next is life Serrano.,66,,
150,0.97,788.621,791.123,Hi.,67,,
151,0.97,791.123,804.17,I am calling to support the upcoming piece of legislation from Councilmember Sawant's office on police accountability.,67,,
152,0.97,804.17,819.151,This piece of legislation will provide findings who we can support the affordable housing project and require landlords to provide relocation when they displace tenants.,67,,
153,0.97,819.151,832.965,The SPD should not have any connection with countries that violate human rights.,67,,
154,0.97,832.965,838.037,This was a huge victory but our community needs much more.,67,,
155,0.97,838.037,851.784,The city council must condemn the community and commit to funding a new hope of family affordable housing projects.,67,,
156,0.97,851.784,854.687,"Again, I --",67,,
157,0.97,854.687,856.755,Thank you.,68,,

160,0.97,879.678,879.945,Hi.,69,,
161,0.97,879.945,881.714,I have a lived experience with a deadly exchange.,69,,
162,0.97,881.714,883.415,"It passed in my town, Durham, North Carolina.",69,,
163,0.97,883.415,884.783,It claimed Israeli and hurt black Americans.,69,,
164,0.97,884.783,885.584,It is a lie.,69,,
165,0.97,885.584,886.185,It is sick.,69,,
166,0.97,886.185,894.526,It is dangerous . false narrative like deadly exchange are making our lives hell.,69,,
167,0.97,894.526,904.036,"Jews are getting beaten up, bullied into closing businesses.",69,,
168,0.97,904.036,918.05,"After deadly exchange passed in my town, we try to convince our black neighbors that Jews are not out to get them . Then came posters of Jews with tentacles, Swastikas, Blistering . durum is broken, but Seattle stands a chance.",69,,
169,0.97,918.05,920.452,We get false narratives.,69,,
170,0.97,920.452,926.992,Reject hatred . reject deadly exchange.,69,,
171,0.97,926.992,928.46,Thank you.,69,,
172,0.97,928.46,934.133,"Up next is Hannah, followed by Monty and we will hear from Zachary Andrews.",70,,
173,0.97,934.133,935.334,"Hannah, welcome.",70,,
174,0.97,935.334,956.889,"Hi, I am a Renter in district 3. I think we had the opportunity to pass a bunch of really exciting crucially needed new Legislations in the coming weeks and months I am calling it to urge the city Council to vote yes on five bills and amendments from Councilmember Sawant's office.",71,,
175,0.97,956.889,961.961,This is on the city council.,71,,
176,0.97,961.961,978.844,The resolution to fully fund the new hope affordable housing project which was raised by Swats office and they will create 90 affordable homes and families with historic roots can stay or return to a neighborhood.,71,,
177,0.97,978.844,993.158,Also incredibly important is the bill from Sawant's office to ban the PD from having relations with nations that violate internationally acceptable standards of human rights.,71,,
178,0.97,993.158,1000.532,There are two Renters bills providing relocation assistance for tenants displaced due to rent increases.,71,,
179,0.97,1000.532,1012.444,Next up is Mary and then we will hear from Michael grant.,72,,
180,0.97,1012.444,1032.03,I am a resident of Seattle and the son of a holocaust survivor and I am Council bill 120142 . Please do not think that blaming foreign government for SPD's racism will solve those problems.,73,,
181,0.97,1032.03,1035.667,These are American problems and it doesn't make any sense to start looking for another country to blame.,73,,
182,0.97,1035.667,1037.002,It is potentially quite harmful.,73,,
183,0.97,1037.002,1045.177,Trump has repeatedly blamed China for Covid and has led to an Uptick in Anti-Asian hate crime.,73,,

210,0.97,1264.963,1287.019,I am speaking in favor of legislation to stop our police from training with countries that consistently violate human rights .

725,0.97,4839.835,4884.512,"We received analysis from central staff . The analysis shows that the facial recognition technology is currently within the jurisdiction and Purview of the surveillance ordinance, meaning the use of the technology is currently Pivoted unless reviewed and approved as described in the graphic, or as described in the ordinance itself . In order to eliminate any confusion in the future, whether facial recognition technology is covered by the surveillance ordinance, council central staff recommended we use the clerk file as the mechanism for the particular clarification.",248,,
726,0.97,4884.512,4896.625,We also sort of heard a differing opinions from chief Diaz in the Seattle police Department back in November of 2020 when this issue was first brought to public awareness.,248,,

1004,0.97,6452.179,6490.016,"I do support the legislation and I think it is important we have a strategy around the finite parking supply in the uptown neighborhood and how the coming significantly large events at the climate pledge arena will affect that parking supply . I do want to put on the record for folks watching and this will probably be redundant to the discourse in the transportation committee but for the first hour or first two hours of parking, the rate will be assessed at $3.00 an hour.",396,,
1005,0.97,6490.016,6496.489,For the second period it will be assessed at $8.00 an hour with the director discretion to increase to $12.00 an hour.,396,,

I think it is important to acknowledge that the uptown neighborhood has considerable additional demands as a neighborhood with a number of small businesses with additional arts and entertainment facilities in the region, all of which will be competing for limited parking supply . I do want to go on the record and say I think it is important that when we are planning moving several thousand people into a discrete area, we provide incentives to take advantage of the multitude of direct bus routes to go to the campus from all over the city of Seattle that we take advantage of the souped-up Monorail transfer that is going to be available to visitors on game days to transfer from the lightning rail at Westlake to the Monorail in order to get to the center campus .
