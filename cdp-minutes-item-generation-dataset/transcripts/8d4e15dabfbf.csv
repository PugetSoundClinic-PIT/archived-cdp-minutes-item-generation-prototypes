239,0.97,1086.118,1089.221,I have been a builder and an affordable housing provider in Seattle for over 50 years.,75,,
240,0.97,1089.221,1092.691,Over that time I have been watching the regulatory burden the housing providers steadily increase.,75,,
241,0.97,1092.691,1101.099,It's becoming more adversarial and downright hostile to small people like myself.,75,,
242,0.97,1101.099,1103.502,While watching Affordability become nothing more than a Catchphrase.,75,,
243,0.97,1103.502,1127.559,"While the aim of this is to align the current plan with the state plan, changing the timing from the ending of the States emergency declaration to six months after the city's declaration creates not only confusion but also additional hardship on local mom and pop housing providers like myself.",75,,
244,0.97,1127.559,1133.699,Regardless of your best intentions Seattle is currently hemorrhaging rental housing units.,75,,
245,0.97,1133.699,1146.245,"As you know Seattle's rental registration rolls have dropped by almost 10,000 units between may 1ST, 2021, and January 1st, 2022.",75,,
246,0.97,1146.245,1149.381,"That's 10,000 rental units gone from Seattle in just seven months.",75,,
247,0.97,1149.381,1156.054,"About 12.7% of those are Single- family units, most likely converting from rental to owner occupied.",75,,
248,0.97,1156.054,1172.771,The remainder duplex and more likely go to developers who Demolish the older affordable housing and replace with more expensive and profitable units.,75,,
249,0.97,1172.771,1180.712,Small mom and pop housing providers like myself are being forced to get out.,75,,
250,0.97,1180.712,1183.649,Thank you.,76,,

255,0.97,1199.932,1204.369,I'm here to urge you to amend CB 120305.,77,,
256,0.97,1204.369,1228.827,"We would like to bring--this ordinance references the requirement for payment plans but it ties the city repayment plan to the city emergency, not the state emergency.",77,,
257,0.97,1228.827,1231.997,"This is unnecessary, confusing, and leaves Seattle housing providers guessing which laws apply to them.",77,,
258,0.97,1231.997,1235.3,Making it more difficult to ensure they are fully in compliance with city and state law.,77,,
259,0.97,1235.3,1245.978,Rha urges the Council to change the ordinance proclaimed by the governor's proclamation 20-05.,77,,
260,0.97,1245.978,1252.317,"The state already provides ample protection for tenants facing ongoing financial difficulties resulting from the Covid pandemic, including the state wide requirement for repayment plan already applies to Seattle.",77,,
261,0.97,1252.317,1265.063,We must prevent further isolation of Seattle's rental housing policy that is forcing small housing providers out of the city at an unprecedented rate.,77,,
262,0.97,1265.063,1271.203,We would like to see future housing policy have a more robust Stakeholder process where all voices are brought to the table.,77,,
263,0.97,1271.203,1275.54,We must work together if we are going to pass policy that will actually address the housing crisis present in Seattle.,77,,

270,0.97,1292.824,1307.005,I'm a Renter in district 6. a city Councilmember recently stated that the proposed Covid rent repayment plan came about because they listened.,81,,
271,0.97,1307.005,1310.676,Who did you listen to?,81,,
272,0.97,1310.676,1335.701,"I haven't seen any panel discussions, zoom meetings, or reports from the meetings that might have been held with the promised legislation that you are going to stand up for small landlord Commission for small property owners.",81,,
273,0.97,1335.701,1346.778,There is a Plethora of timely data available in the city pertaining to a vast number of important issues.,81,,
274,0.97,1346.778,1365.097,It seems the city council is not interested in listening to data from the our I/O Database that tracks the number of available rental units.,81,,
275,0.97,1365.097,1373.105,This legislation will just escalate the decline of affordable rental housing.,81,,
276,0.97,1373.105,1376.341,As the small landlords continue to flee the market.,81,,
277,0.97,1376.341,1382.848,Thank you.,81,,

291,0.97,1469.434,1474.005,I was president of the Washington state labor Council.,86,,
292,0.97,1474.005,1488.32,Now I am Copresident for advocates of retirement . never has the Medicare system been under such a threat.,86,,
293,0.97,1488.32,1498.296,"We have partnered with the physicians for the national health plan, social security, and--profiting off of our Medicare system.",86,,
294,0.97,1498.296,1501.399,For four decades Wall Street has tried and failed to privatize social security.,86,,
295,0.97,1501.399,1504.469,Now they have set their target on the Medicare system.,86,,
296,0.97,1504.469,1508.406,It doesn't take a mathematician to figure out why.,86,,
297,0.97,1508.406,1526.958,It's expected that by 2028 $1.6 trillion a year of annual Medicare expenditures will happen . This is the proverbial goose that lays the golden egg.,86,,
298,0.97,1526.958,1530.061,"For seniors it is our health, quality life, and actual lives that are at stake.",86,,
299,0.97,1530.061,1541.573,Public health experts predict that if Wall Street firms are allowed to skim profits off of the Medicare system it will result in a demeaning issue of quality and quantity of Healthcare services and benefits.,86,,
300,0.97,1541.573,1553.018,"There will be a drawdown of the Medicaid trust fund which will result in either further custom Medicare benefits or increase in Medicare taxes and premiums, or both.",86,,
301,0.97,1553.018,1557.222,"To spin a phrase, what is good for the Wall Street goose is not good for the Medicare recipient.",86,,
302,0.97,1557.222,1567.832,"Please stand with the seniors, disabled, and passive to say no to privatizing the Medicare system . Thank you for your consideration.",86,,

307,0.97,1581.813,1584.082,I am a small landlord in Seattle.,89,,

309,0.97,1585.717,1590.655,I am calling in regard to counsel bill 120305.,89,,
310,0.97,1590.655,1608.239,It's very disturbing to me that the city is switching the laws around--for a payment.,89,,
311,0.97,1608.239,1616.047,Extending the time frames is confusing for the repayment program.,89,,
312,0.97,1616.047,1624.723,The state Legislature clearly States when these measures are needed.,89,,
313,0.97,1624.723,1630.462,"-- housing providers driving a small mom and pop landlords, like me.",89,,
314,0.97,1630.462,1632.53,We are the best low-cost housing providers in the city.,89,,
315,0.97,1632.53,1634.099,This is a real problem.,89,,
316,0.97,1634.099,1639.504,The goal should be to encourage mom and pop landlords.,89,,
317,0.97,1639.504,1656.721,People who are attentive to the tenants and keep the rents relatively low by comparison to what is often a replacement for modern construction.,89,,
318,0.97,1656.721,1664.496,The goal should be to make it as easy as possible to be a landlord rather than putting extra burdens on them.,89,,
319,0.97,1664.496,1673.304,As a result of the burdens that the city has put in place our people are selling their affordable housing units.,89,,
320,0.97,1673.304,1675.74,I get an offer at least every week.,89,,
321,0.97,1675.74,1682.08,Sometimes multiple offers come in the mail for people wanting to buy my rental property.,89,,
322,0.97,1682.08,1690.655,What they would do is tear it down and put up a single-family house.,89,,
323,0.97,1690.655,1697.228,I've got two affordable Single- family homes.,89,,
324,0.97,1697.228,1699.898,They would tear them down and put up a multimillion dollar properties.,89,,
325,0.97,1699.898,1702.167,That is not leading to what you really want in the city.,89,,
326,0.97,1702.167,1705.837,I thank you for this opportunity and encourage you to vote against counsel bill 120305.,89,,

333,0.97,1731.863,1741.94,A lot to speak in support of the resolution to stop the privatization of our Medicare system and I think Council member Mosqueda for sponsoring this resolution.,92,,
334,0.97,1741.94,1743.174,This issue is important to me.,92,,
335,0.97,1743.174,1748.68,Not only because it affects our general society but because is is personal to me.,92,,
336,0.97,1748.68,1753.384,I now depend on Medicare for my health.,92,,
337,0.97,1753.384,1758.99,"As a matter of fact we have many seniors in our family, including my husband, who have major health issues that depend on Medicare.",92,,
338,0.97,1758.99,1763.461,Working people fight for Medicare and other safety nets.,92,,
339,0.97,1763.461,1771.836,As a lifetime worker in the United States I paid for this system and I don't want any further privatization of it.,92,,
340,0.97,1771.836,1783.982,"I don't believe that the opening of doors to private corporations by implanting--will improve, enhance, or especially address inequities that already exist in our Healthcare system.",92,,
341,0.97,1783.982,1791.156,Equity is one of the principles with which the right to Healthcare is based on.,92,,
342,0.97,1791.156,1807.338,"We must ensure that seniors, people of color, people with disabilities, and poor people who have been denied many of their human rights have good quality Healthcare.",92,,
343,0.97,1808.139,1813.845,I demand our president and Congress act in the interest of all of our people and close the door on third-party entities in our Medicare system.,92,,

354,0.97,1874.339,1878.009,It's much more within your Purview and expertise than the privatization of Medicare.,95,,

371,0.97,1923.855,1931.095,Our first one up is out of the Finance and housing committee with Councilmember Mosqueda.,100,,

379,0.97,1951.049,1954.085,We bring to this piece of legislation that is about transparency and accountability.,103,,
380,0.97,1954.085,1961.492,"This is an update to the payment of claims template, a document that we see every week in full counsel.",103,,
381,0.97,1961.492,1964.128,However that document has not been updated for the last 20 years.,103,,
382,0.97,1964.128,1982.613,"It is an old document that references a defunct audit committee and it's an opportunity for us here, as we not only make technical corrections but really Recommit to making sure that us as Councilmembers, members of the C family, and partnerships with the executive and community are providing a transparent accounting of all of our payments and claims.",103,,
383,0.97,1982.613,1992.056,The template and the resolution in front of us is really the result of collaborative work between our city central staff.,103,,
384,0.97,1992.056,1994.859,And also the city budget office.,103,,
385,0.97,1994.859,2004.102,I want to thank director Julie and Glenn Lee for their contributions to updating this template in front of us today.,103,,
386,0.97,2004.102,2020.818,"Of course this work is only part of our overall process to provide greater transparency, accountability, and clarity, as we move forward with our budgeting efforts.",103,,
387,0.97,2020.818,2028.459,I'm proud to serve as the budget chair and look forward to having your support on this updated document so we can have greater clarity every week as we vote on the payments of claims.,103,,

420,0.97,2115.613,2117.048,The committee recommends that the bill passed.,123,,
421,0.97,2117.048,2117.648,In Queue.,124,,
422,0.97,2117.648,2120.318,Councilmember Strauss?,124,,
423,0.97,2120.318,2121.786,Thank you Council President.,125,,
424,0.97,2121.786,2124.589,I know the chair of the committee is not present with us today.,125,,
425,0.97,2124.589,2128.092,I appreciate the fact that we are able to bring my bill before us today.,125,,
426,0.97,2128.092,2128.392,Say again?,125,,
427,0.97,2128.392,2129.527,"I just said anytime, buddy.",126,,
428,0.97,2129.527,2130.128,Thank you.,127,,
429,0.97,2130.128,2131.095,Thank you.,127,,
430,0.97,2131.095,2132.33,I love this.,127,,
431,0.97,2132.33,2140.171,"Anyhow, I also appreciate the public Commenters today who have called in.",127,,
432,0.97,2140.171,2145.743,"Which is why I, along with Councilmember Lewis, created the small landlord work group.",127,,
433,0.97,2145.743,2147.578,There are some snags and getting that set up.,127,,
434,0.97,2147.578,2162.627,I can tell you we both met about it this week to get it moving faster and we both set up the rental market housing study to have that information for the first time since 2018 so that we can backup and have the data that is with us today.,127,,
435,0.97,2162.627,2174.572,"It's important for us to have this data so we can backup the stories of the mom and pop landlords who are selling their properties, with the data before us, so we can have all the information.",127,,
436,0.97,2174.572,2182.146,The bill before us today helps us ensure that landlords are made whole and tenants have a reasonable time to repay their debt.,127,,
437,0.97,2182.146,2186.517,The tenant does remain responsible for repaying any and all debt that they have incurred.,127,,
438,0.97,2186.517,2194.892,"This bill is a technical correction the legislation we passed in 2020, which was passed two months after the pandemic began.",127,,
439,0.97,2194.892,2212.176,"In May of 2020 the Council adopted ordinance 126081 so that payment plans were offered that lasted 3 to 6 months, depending on the amount of rent owed.",127,,
440,0.97,2212.176,2213.377,"Today is April 26th, 2022.",127,,
441,0.97,2213.377,2221.586,If this was 2020 the pandemic would have started last month and we would have passed the original bill next month.,127,,
442,0.97,2221.586,2226.757,"At that time we believed the pandemic would only last two weeks, and then two months.",127,,
443,0.97,2226.757,2229.226,We definitely did not for see it lasting two years or more.,127,,
444,0.97,2229.226,2239.237,"We did know then, when everything was shut and many people's line of work froze, that many people needed to address the debt incurred during the Closedown.",127,,
445,0.97,2239.237,2253.517,"The following legislative session, the first legislative session, once the pandemic began, the state passed a similar repayment legislation.",127,,
446,0.97,2253.517,2256.42,If we were in 2020 when this bill would have passed nine days ago.,127,,
447,0.97,2256.42,2262.159,That Legislature had the benefit of allowing a year longer to understand if the pandemic was going to last longer than two weeks or two months.,127,,
448,0.97,2262.159,2267.431,The reason I refer to this modest bill is a technical correction because the legislation before you today is a mirror of our States legislation.,127,,
449,0.97,2267.431,2280.311,There are some very small differences that come from the original bill and this bill requires a reasonable repayment plan for debt incurred during the Covid-19 state of emergency.,127,,
450,0.97,2280.311,2284.415,"Colleagues, I know I brought this up at the Council briefing before, or yesterday.",127,,
451,0.97,2284.415,2288.152,I'm happy to answer any questions.,127,,
452,0.97,2288.152,2293.157,Are there any questions for Councilmember Strauss?,128,,
453,0.97,2293.157,2293.557,All right.,128,,
454,0.97,2293.557,2294.725,I'm not seeing any.,128,,
455,0.97,2294.725,2298.663,"Madam clerk, please call the role.",128,,
456,0.97,2298.663,2300.331,"I'm sorry, Councilmember Nelson?",128,,
457,0.97,2300.331,2305.202,I can't hear you.,128,,
458,0.97,2305.202,2306.237,Upper right.,128,,
459,0.97,2306.237,2312.309,Yeah.,128,,
460,0.97,2312.309,2313.277,Go ahead.,128,,
461,0.97,2313.277,2321.652,"I have to say, thank you very much for bringing this forward because I do believe that clarity and repayment plans are necessary.",129,,
462,0.97,2321.652,2328.426,I will admit that I missed the conversation in the Sustainability and Renters rights committee.,129,,
463,0.97,2328.426,2330.394,That's on me.,129,,
464,0.97,2330.394,2341.305,However this legislation was heard in committee only days after introduction and we only had one eating to discuss and vote.,129,,
465,0.97,2341.305,2348.312,What's important to me is landlords have the of nullity to weigh in on this before we discuss it.,129,,
466,0.97,2348.312,2352.85,I'm told that was not the case.,129,,
467,0.97,2352.85,2357.922,Basically this bill is characterized as a technical fix to bring us into alignment with state statute.,129,,
468,0.97,2357.922,2380.277,"Digging into this, since then, I have learned it is not quite in perfect alignment and would likely lengthen the time the arrears specified in the repayment plans longer than the state statute provides for.",129,,
469,0.97,2380.277,2387.618,I will just read some comments from central staff when I asked about this.,129,,
470,0.97,2387.618,2395.793,"This bill is tied to the end of the city civil emergency, not the States public health emergency.",129,,
471,0.97,2395.793,2405.269,"It extends for six months after the end of the city civil emergency, where the state statute does not extend past the state public health emergency.",129,,
472,0.97,2405.269,2412.843,"The state ended its Eviction moratorium on June 30th, 2021.",129,,
473,0.97,2412.843,2433.497,"So ours has gone on much longer than that and this would cover arrears that are incurred during the six-month period after we ended the civil emergency, or at the end of the Eviction moratorium.",129,,
474,0.97,2433.497,2434.899,There's much more detail in here.,129,,
475,0.97,2434.899,2442.44,The bottom line is that I am concerned about losing rental housing stock.,129,,
476,0.97,2442.44,2448.612,Particularly that of small landlords who have less resources.,129,,
477,0.97,2448.612,2454.785,With the Eviction moratorium and the rent that is ongoing.,129,,
478,0.97,2454.785,2460.424,We require them to keep their properties in good condition.,129,,
479,0.97,2460.424,2481.612,I'm just concerned about prolonging the time that these small landlords will have to get that money to maintain their properties and add additional uncertainty about when that might happen.,129,,
480,0.97,2481.612,2492.456,I again apologize for bringing up these concerns at the last minute.,129,,
481,0.97,2492.456,2494.725,I will have to vote no on this piece of legislation.,129,,
482,0.97,2494.725,2495.793,"Thank you, Councilmember Nelson.",130,,
483,0.97,2495.793,2498.429,And thank you for sharing your policy reasons for your vote today.,130,,
484,0.97,2498.429,2499.029,Is there anyone else?,130,,

619,0.97,2863.16,2869.566,"Thank you very much, Madam president and colleagues.",203,,
620,0.97,2869.566,2883.814,I know there is a shared interest on Healthcare for all and I appreciate your interest in this and all of the ways in which we have continued to call for protection of social safety net services.,203,,
621,0.97,2883.814,2886.516,I want to thank you for considering this resolution in front of us today.,203,,
622,0.97,2886.516,2891.855,It follows devious efforts to support Medicare for all to support a strong call for social safety net programs at the National to local level.,203,,
623,0.97,2891.855,2906.236,"I want to thank all of the folks who called in this morning, or I should say this afternoon, to encourage us to support this resolution . The Washington state labor Council, former President Jeff Johnson and the Cochair are advocates for retirement action.",203,,
624,0.97,2906.236,2909.706,"We also heard from Cindy, a community advocate as well.",203,,
625,0.97,2909.706,2924.688,"We are here today to consider this resolution . that is a call to make sure we are continuing to defend Medicare services services for seniors, members of the community with disabilities, and other vulnerable populations who need Medicare now.",203,,
626,0.97,2924.688,2930.927,"And I think for all of us as well, who will need a strong public Medicare program in the future.",203,,
627,0.97,2930.927,2941.171,The resolution in front of us shows the city councils concern regarding repeated attempts to make and roads toward privatization of the Medicare system.,203,,
628,0.97,2941.171,2943.607,This isn't about attacking President Biden or his agencies.,203,,
629,0.97,2943.607,2950.514,This is about raising concerns about unintended consequences so we can steer the Federal administration towards a better path.,203,,
630,0.97,2950.514,2958.455,"We are sending a message, a call for action, in a respectful way to our president and the Federal agencies.",203,,
631,0.97,2958.455,2977.24,"Just like 50 other members of Congress did, who expressed their concern about the proposed effort to move toward privatizing Medicare and a pilot project when the administrator took over.",203,,
632,0.97,2977.24,2988.885,"At the heart of the concern, from the Healthcare community and from congressional members, is that under the previous title of Medicare direct contracting, and under the rib rated title of care organizations realizing equity, access, and community health.",203,,
633,0.97,2988.885,3002.265,"No matter the title the concern remains that CMS, centers for Medicaid and Medicare services, can contract with private entities to manage Medicare services.",203,,
634,0.97,3002.265,3003.934,Now these contracts could be with hospitals and clinics.,203,,
635,0.97,3003.934,3008.305,But they can also be with four profit investors.,203,,
636,0.97,3008.305,3021.284,"Like private equity firms, insurance companies, corporate Healthcare businesses . Under the initial pilot of direct contracting entities allowed for 75% of the Governance to be controlled by private insurers and other investment hackers.",203,,
637,0.97,3021.284,3033.764,So when the Congresswoman sent in her letter in late February she said direct contracting is a major threat to Medicare coverage.,203,,
638,0.97,3033.764,3034.765,It's hidden in the bureaucracy.,203,,
639,0.97,3034.765,3053.517,And while she's glad the administration is taking steps towards Transitioning away from some of the flawed programs waiting until next year's rollback of the program will only embolden the private investors that are already taking advantage of the system and more must be done to fight against this effort.,203,,
640,0.97,3053.517,3068.732,This echoes what you heard from Jeff Johnson as well and other public health advocates around the country who see no difference between the Aco reach pilot and the direct contracting pilot.,203,,
641,0.97,3068.732,3072.369,Since both programs allow for third-party and private entities to wedge themselves between patients and their Healthcare.,203,,
642,0.97,3072.369,3088.518,This is about making sure we are Reinstalling trust and stability into Medicare as a system and we need to ward off against any efforts to draw down the Medicare Trust Fund by making huge profits for corporation . including weakening services for beneficiaries.,203,,
643,0.97,3088.518,3096.126,"Beneficiaries who are Elders, committee members, and members of the community with other Vulnerabilities and disabilities.",203,,
644,0.97,3096.126,3107.938,There is no clear plan for the Aco reach pilot to address the fundamental inequities suffered by by individuals due to historic under Resourcing.,203,,
645,0.97,3107.938,3109.773,That's where we should be focusing our effort.,203,,
646,0.97,3109.773,3110.941,Thank you for considering this resolution.,203,,
647,0.97,3110.941,3114.544,This resolution that calls for the Council to send a United message to our representatives in Congress.,203,,
648,0.97,3114.544,3122.586,We stand with those who sent in messages and we ask for reconsideration of the pilot project in front of us.,203,,
649,0.97,3122.586,3141.505,Us and other jurisdiction around the country are sending a message to encourage President Biden and the Secretary of health human services to move away from this pilot effort because of the risk it creates to the Medicare system.,203,,
650,0.97,3141.505,3149.479,"Again, this is not about attacking President Biden or his agencies, this is about raising those concerns, the unintended consequences, so we can steer the Federal administration toward a better path for all of us.",203,,
651,0.97,3149.479,3152.649,Current Medicare beneficiaries and all of us as future beneficiaries.,203,,
652,0.97,3152.649,3165.495,"Thank you for consideration and there are other Council members that worked on this issue for a long time, including Council member Herbold.",203,,
653,0.97,3165.495,3169.432,I thank you for the opportunity to raise this for the Council today and I look for your support.,203,,
654,0.97,3169.432,3170.734,"Thank you, Councilmember Mosqueda.",204,,
655,0.97,3170.734,3174.571,"Madam clerk, was I supposed to move the adopt of the resolution or was Councilmember Mosqueda supposed to move?",204,,
656,0.97,3174.571,3176.039,I don't the guy moved.,204,,
657,0.97,3176.039,3176.706,You are correct.,205,,
658,0.97,3176.706,3178.875,It has not been moved at this point.,205,,
659,0.97,3178.875,3181.611,Either you or Council member Mosqueda can move at this point.,205,,
660,0.97,3181.611,3187.184,Will Councilmember Mosqueda movie adoption?,206,,
661,0.97,3187.184,3187.984,I would love to.,207,,
662,0.97,3187.984,3189.819,I'm so excited about this topic.,207,,
663,0.97,3189.819,3200.33,"Council colleagues, I move resolution 32052, which calls for stopping the privatization of the Medicare system.",207,,
664,0.97,3200.33,3202.632,Let's hear a second?,208,,
665,0.97,3202.632,3206.703,Do we have a second?,208,,
666,0.97,3206.703,3208.872,Council member Mosqueda has already introduced and moved to resolution.,208,,
667,0.97,3208.872,3211.408,Now we will open the floor.,208,,
668,0.97,3211.408,3214.511,Are there any Council members that would like to speak to the resolution?,208,,
669,0.97,3214.511,3215.345,I will speak last.,208,,
670,0.97,3215.345,3222.118,Before we do the roll call.,208,,
671,0.97,3222.118,3223.92,We have Council member Herbold and Councilmember Nelson.,208,,
672,0.97,3223.92,3224.421,Councilmember Herbold?,208,,
673,0.97,3224.421,3225.422,"Thank you, Madam President.",209,,
674,0.97,3225.422,3227.824,And thank you Councilmember Mosqueda for bringing this forward.,209,,
675,0.97,3227.824,3240.003,I have worked on Council resolutions in the past supporting Medicare for all.,209,,
676,0.97,3240.003,3244.074,"I have not worked on this particular issue and I'm so glad you have taken it up, Councilmember Mosqueda.",209,,
677,0.97,3244.074,3245.709,You may have mentioned this in your remarks.,209,,
678,0.97,3245.709,3251.815,One of the points that I really want to lift up is how well Medicare spends its dollars.,209,,
679,0.97,3251.815,3260.89,98% of its budget is spent on patient care.,209,,
680,0.97,3260.89,3263.26,That is tax dollars going to directly support patient care.,209,,
681,0.97,3263.26,3285.815,"Where as these direct contracting agencies reportedly spent 60% of their tax dollars, our tax dollars, on patient care . which makes it possible for up to 40% of tax revenues to be used for their own profit and overhead.",209,,
682,0.97,3285.815,3301.698,"Just from a fiscal responsibility standpoint, watching the taxpayer dollar as well as ensuring that those tax dollars go further to serve more people in our communities, this is a really important issue.",209,,
683,0.97,3301.698,3316.413,"Again, thank you for bringing it forward and thank you to the Congresswoman for wearing her organizing hat and getting so many members of Congress to sign on in support of this effort.",209,,
684,0.97,3316.413,3317.347,Thank you.,210,,
685,0.97,3317.347,3319.916,Council member Nelson?,210,,
686,0.97,3319.916,3323.687,And then Councilmember Pedersen.,210,,
687,0.97,3323.687,3324.487,Thank you very much.,211,,
688,0.97,3324.487,3329.859,"The title of this resolution is, stop the private citation of Medicare.",211,,
689,0.97,3329.859,3340.704,"I'm a lifelong Democrat, like President Biden, and I endorse the private Medicare . I--by slogan.",211,,
690,0.97,3340.704,3356.753,I appreciate the information that Council member Mosqueda provided yesterday in response to my question . There are still a lot of unanswered questions that I have about how this impacts our constituents.,211,,
691,0.97,3356.753,3374.237,"But first I must note that of the 50 people that signed that letter only Congresswoman, of all of our delegation, signed it.",211,,
692,0.97,3374.237,3386.216,I'm concerned about damaging our relationships with our Federal delegation by voting on this without knowing what their thoughts are.,211,,
693,0.97,3386.216,3389.185,"Like I said, I'm concerned about the impact to our constituents.",211,,
694,0.97,3389.185,3401.965,Yesterday I noted that I have no information about how calling for the cessation of this program would impact our residence.,211,,
695,0.97,3401.965,3403.366,Is there another program that would be better?,211,,
696,0.97,3403.366,3409.906,Does this program fill a need that Medicare simply cannot provide?,211,,
697,0.97,3409.906,3420.85,There was information provided in Councilmember Mosqueda's remarks and the information she sent yesterday.,211,,
698,0.97,3420.85,3432.629,"There's also information Online from the center for medical services, which talks about how this program is very different from trumps previous program.",211,,
699,0.97,3432.629,3438.968,So it's not necessarily on one's perspective simply a Rebranding of a Trump program.,211,,
700,0.97,3438.968,3447.477,In any case I don't have enough information on what would be the implications on our constituents.,211,,
701,0.97,3447.477,3448.845,That is why represent.,211,,
702,0.97,3448.845,3453.616,I don't represent advocates or medical service providers.,211,,
703,0.97,3453.616,3463.66,That is something that I think we need to keep in mind when we vote on something as extremely complex as Healthcare policy.,211,,
704,0.97,3463.66,3471.034,"Thank you, Councilmember Nelson.",212,,
705,0.97,3471.034,3471.734,Then Councilmember Pedersen.,212,,
706,0.97,3471.734,3475.772,If I don't see anyone else that I will make my last statements and we will go to a vote.,212,,
707,0.97,3475.772,3476.372,Councilmember Pedersen?,212,,
708,0.97,3476.372,3477.54,"Thank you, Council President.",213,,
709,0.97,3477.54,3482.879,I agree with the sponsor of this resolution that Medicare should not be privatized.,213,,
710,0.97,3482.879,3488.885,Thank you Council member Mosqueda for your Advocation of public health and representing us nationally.,213,,
711,0.97,3488.885,3496.96,"I also share some of the concerns raised by Councilmember Nelson . again, I oppose privatizing Medicare.",213,,
712,0.97,3496.96,3511.975,"This resolution does seem to contradict President Biden, regarding a specific complicated issue that would impact this complicated system.",213,,
713,0.97,3511.975,3513.81,President Biden was here in Seattle just last week.,213,,
714,0.97,3513.81,3521.017,I don't think our office was able to confer with the Biden administration about this.,213,,
715,0.97,3521.017,3535.465,"So even if this resolution about the Federal policy was not expedited on today's agenda I'm just not able to give this issue the time it deserves, being focused on some of the local issues in my Committee for example.",213,,
716,0.97,3535.465,3552.649,"I believe this is a good example of why it might be appropriate to provide us, as independently elected officials, with the option on a case-by-case basis for certain issues like this.",213,,
717,0.97,3552.649,3556.386,This is why I have been collaborating with the Council President on how best to update our policy.,213,,
718,0.97,3556.386,3559.322,That will be discussed in the Governance meeting this Thursday.,213,,
719,0.97,3559.322,3560.089,Thank you.,213,,
720,0.97,3560.089,3564.327,Thank you.,214,,
721,0.97,3564.327,3569.632,I want to think--make a few comments.,214,,
722,0.97,3569.632,3572.936,"First of all, thank you to Councilmember Mosqueda.",214,,
723,0.97,3572.936,3590.219,"Being on the Seattle city council sometimes, we all had prior lives, at some point all of us have subject matter expertise from our former lives.",214,,
724,0.97,3590.219,3592.922,I know that Council number Mosqueda has in-depth experience with Healthcare services.,214,,
725,0.97,3592.922,3599.195,I rely on that because that is her Committee and they have an understanding.,214,,
726,0.97,3599.195,3601.731,I trust her judgment that she would bring to a something that is important.,214,,
727,0.97,3601.731,3605.635,That being said I do understand what Councilmember Nelson and Councilmember Pedersen are saying.,214,,
728,0.97,3605.635,3619.816,I don't think we are in imminent danger of Medicare or Medicaid for that matter of being privatized . and we certainly don't want that.,214,,
729,0.97,3619.816,3620.65,So I understand that.,214,,
730,0.97,3620.65,3622.619,I also understand what Councilmember Nelson said about slogans.,214,,
731,0.97,3622.619,3624.587,I don't think she meant that in a negative manner.,214,,
732,0.97,3624.587,3626.255,More like we can't have a shorthand way.,214,,
733,0.97,3626.255,3627.49,Back to Council member Mosqueda.,214,,
734,0.97,3627.49,3631.394,I think we all have read the dangers.,214,,
735,0.97,3631.394,3634.43,That's not why we are here today.,214,,
736,0.97,3634.43,3649.445,I understand where everyone's intentions are in regards to this resolution and I'm glad Councilmember Pedersen brought up that at the Thursday committee we will be addressing and changing the rules.,214,,
737,0.97,3649.445,3653.349,Councilmembers can indeed abstain if they feel they need to on any particular resolutions.,214,,
738,0.97,3653.349,3655.485,"That being said, I will just leave it alone.",214,,
739,0.97,3655.485,3660.59,I want to make an offhand comment.,214,,
740,0.97,3660.59,3661.824,It probably wouldn't be funny right now.,214,,
741,0.97,3661.824,3663.326,I just want to say this.,214,,
742,0.97,3663.326,3675.071,"This elected body, this city Council has a long history of supporting, opposing, clarifying, educating, or addressing many issues and policies directed at Federal agencies.",214,,
743,0.97,3675.071,3685.581,"We do that most notably with the Department of interior, Department of justice, Department of homeland security.",214,,
744,0.97,3685.581,3688.351,We do it with health and human services.,214,,
745,0.97,3688.351,3705.468,"In short we don't need a direct regulatory authority or jurisdictional authority to have an opinion or to authorize or propose a Council resolution to address any of these issues, like what Councilmember Mosqueda brought us today.",214,,
746,0.97,3705.468,3729.592,"I will say, being on this Council for six years, there have been times where resolutions have come before us that, quite frankly, or in other countries and even though I understand the issue and I understand what Councilmember Nelson was getting at we have to be clear about what affects us.",214,,
747,0.97,3729.592,3731.194,Not only as Americans but what affects us regionally.,214,,
748,0.97,3731.194,3732.028,What affects us locally.,214,,
749,0.97,3732.028,3733.062,And also representing tribes.,214,,
750,0.97,3733.062,3745.875,"We have done many of these resolutions in letters to the congressional delegation in just about every federal agency, regarding everything from Healthcare to environmental issues.",214,,
751,0.97,3745.875,3746.843,So is not uncommon.,214,,
752,0.97,3746.843,3748.878,It's an elected tool and I think we use it well.,214,,
753,0.97,3748.878,3756.319,"But I think the point here is, at some point, we have to trust that our teammate may know a little bit more and therefore is bringing this forward in good faith.",214,,
754,0.97,3756.319,3760.356,I will be supporting Councilmember Mosqueda's resolution today.,214,,
755,0.97,3760.356,3775.571,I don't really care if the--Council number Mosqueda brings a wealth of knowledge and professional experience.,214,,
756,0.97,3775.571,3777.907,I believe she would not just put this in front of us.,214,,
757,0.97,3777.907,3786.182,"And some of the people that spoke, particularly Cindy and her family, they go way back and I understand the history.",214,,
758,0.97,3786.182,3786.816,I understand that.,214,,
759,0.97,3786.816,3789.585,I guess I have the added advantage of being the oldest person here.,214,,
760,0.97,3789.585,3796.526,With that I don't think that this is just a slogan but I do really respect what Council member Nelson said and I respect what Councilmember Pedersen said.,214,,
761,0.97,3796.526,3806.969,"Again, I want to thank Council member Mosqueda for bringing this forward.",214,,
762,0.97,3806.969,3808.404,With that I will be supporting this.,214,,
763,0.97,3808.404,3810.039,"Madam clerk, can you please call the role?",214,,
764,0.97,3810.039,3810.84,Councilmember Mosqueda?,215,,

783,0.97,3859.956,3860.156,Okay.,228,,
784,0.97,3860.156,3861.924,Let's keep going down today's agenda.,228,,

791,0.97,3875.171,3880.276,I'm sorry that Councilmember Nelson and Pedersen are not also here to hear this.,231,,
792,0.97,3880.276,3885.882,"I want to highlight my staff member, Amanda.",231,,
793,0.97,3885.882,3891.687,Today is her last day in the office and she served the office for over the last two years in an amazing and diligent way.,231,,

795,0.97,3899.528,3902.198,She is still going to be serving us.,231,,
