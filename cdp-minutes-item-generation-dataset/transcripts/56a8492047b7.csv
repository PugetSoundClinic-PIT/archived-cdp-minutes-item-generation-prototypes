242,0.97,2014.946,2019.15,I have sort of two reasons for interest in this particular committee.,57,,

246,0.97,2032.163,2060.825,"I believe in the power of collective action, and I also believe in the power of local government where you all work and local government is really closest to the people, and I love what I have done in my career, and I think the Federal Government has the power to do important, great things, but it's really the local government that is closest to the people, and I'm excited to have this opportunity for that, and the second motivation is around transportation, which is obviously the mandate for the committee.",57,,
247,0.97,2060.825,2079.777,"I have had a lifelong curiosity and interest in transportation and environments and especially sort of public transportation and infrastructure, and it's really what brings us together as a people and in urban environments, we all live a lot closer to each other than elsewhere, and I did grow up in Seattle.",57,,
248,0.97,2079.777,2088.186,"Moved away in the '90s, and came back to find a larger city than I left in the '90s, and I'm excited to sort of dive into the issues and see what they look like.",57,,

250,0.97,2088.92,2089.987,That's my opening statement.,59,,

252,0.97,2094.692,2106.003,"I attended the move Seattle levy oversight committee last night, and I know that they will appreciate, and they are excited about the prospect of having you there to bring that lens to it.",60,,
253,0.97,2106.003,2119.784,Obviously reducing and dealing with the crisis of climate change is paramount as we are dealing with it as Councilmembers.,60,,

263,0.97,2162.66,2169.433,"You know, in the '90s, it was a very different sized city than today.",63,,
264,0.97,2169.433,2172.77,"How has, in your opinion, transportation priorities shifted in that time?",63,,
265,0.97,2172.77,2203.234,"Well, that's great question, I think as you increase the density in the city, the need for public transportation and density of transportation certainly increases, and I certainly seen a lot of examples in Seattle of us doing that as a city, and for example, the Lightrail, and all of those really increasing in the density to transportation are important as the city increases in the density, and that's your second question.",64,,
266,0.97,2203.234,2211.809,"The first question on science, from my career, I would say the two animated things that I have really motivated me in my career.",64,,
267,0.97,2211.809,2216.781,"One the power of public service, and second the POW over science to make the world a better place.",64,,
268,0.97,2216.781,2238.502,"I think that's true across a whole bunch of disciplines and problems, my career is focused on environmental science and environmental problems, but I suspect that it's, you know, similarly true in transportation and many other fields that science can bring to the management problems, and I'm Suspecting I will learn that in this Committee.",64,,

304,0.97,2392.156,2392.656,That button.,91,,
305,0.97,2399.13,2401.632,"Of course, now the I.T.",91,,
306,0.97,2401.632,2402.199,Department just left.,91,,
307,0.97,2402.199,2402.933,"I know, seriously.",92,,
308,0.97,2402.933,2404.668,We are getting someone to help.,93,,
309,0.97,2422.286,2423.821,There we go.,94,,
310,0.97,2423.821,2436.667,"Let's start with introductions, appreciate everyone being here.",95,,
311,0.97,2436.667,2437.034,Absolutely.,96,,
312,0.97,2437.034,2438.936,Lorelei Williams.,96,,
313,0.97,2438.936,2444.475,"Rachel Mccoffrey again, levy manager.",97,,
314,0.97,2444.475,2448.212,And I'm Rachel Ben-Shmuel Coshare of the levy oversight committee.,98,,
315,0.97,2448.212,2457.288,"If you can pull the microphones close, that will help the millions of viewers at home right now.",99,,
316,0.97,2457.288,2462.226,I'm turning it over into the capability hands of Lorelei and Rachel.,99,,
317,0.97,2462.226,2473.571,It's our opportunity with new Council members here to reintroduce where we are on the levy to move Seattle.,99,,
318,0.97,2473.571,2493.991,"We have done a lot of work since the 2018 levy assessment, and a lot of hard work in terms of delivering promises and making sure we are clear and transparent and accountable to the committee and levy Overgiant committee.",99,,
319,0.97,2493.991,2501.498,We will be back in 2019 or 2020 with our 2019 full levy assessment and report.,99,,
320,0.97,2501.498,2505.035,That feeds then into our 2020 work plan.,99,,
321,0.97,2505.035,2513.744,It will be a little bit of both looking forward and looking back in this presentation today.,99,,
322,0.97,2513.744,2538.035,"All right, so and then starting with our vision and mission, and just calling attention to the fact that the levy itself allows us to pay particular attention to our safety, equity, Sustainability and mobility roles, particularly, and so, the levy itself is key to furthering our Commission and vision.",100,,
323,0.97,2538.035,2541.105,And then a short presentation overview.,100,,
324,0.97,2541.105,2555.286,"As Sam eluded to, part of what we wanted to do here today, just give some of the background on the levy, and there's quite a bit of it, back to when it was passed in 2015, and bringing you up to date with where we are now.",100,,
325,0.97,2555.286,2570.434,"We will start with an overview, and then talk about delivery highlights, about the approach we now take to progress reporting, and then as well as talk about the levy oversight committee role, and Rachel is here to help us present, too.",100,,
326,0.97,2572.636,2607.638,"So the overall levy to move Seattle, a $930 million levy, and that is just the base amount of the levy funds, and we have leveraged local funds we used to further advance and deliver with that $930 million, and within the levy program, we have 30 sub programs, and whenever you open a little part, Rachel will get in this later, but there's a lot of detail on each program, and the 30 programs are put in to three primary categories and programs, which is what we show on the slide.",100,,
327,0.97,2607.638,2610.374,"Safe routes, maintenance and repair, and congestion relief.",100,,
328,0.97,2610.374,2631.362,"We stay true to that frame work as we report, and the levy has--within the 30 programs, the large projects like the North gate bridge project that we are celebrating, actually, starting today, and just basic maintenance and repair, tree planting type of activities.",100,,
329,0.97,2631.362,2638.669,It's very broad for us in terms of what we deliver in terms of the levy.,100,,
330,0.97,2638.669,2652.783,"Along those lines what this represents, most of all, it's the size of the bridge in the gap levy, the 9 years prior to this levy, compared to our current move Seattle levy.",100,,
331,0.97,2652.783,2697.361,"It's about three times the size, and that is really great for the investments we can make in our city, and the challenge with that, and this is just walking us back a little bit to even 2015, and when the levy passed at the end of 2015, we were uncertain if it would pass, and Sdot as a Department was both preparing on some level for it to pass, but also preparing for it not to pass, and so when it did pass, which was a wonderful thing, it meant we had a lot of Rampup and development work we needed to do to be able to start being able to deliver on the levy.",100,,
332,0.97,2697.361,2734.731,"And moving to the next slide, Úand I will give just a little more background, and there was a lot of frustration from the public as far as even the oversight committee how quickly we were delivering on the levy, particularly the first couple of years, and the expectations for spending, put forth in the linear fashion, delivering a ninth of the program in the first year, and frankly we weren't Ramped up as staff and prepared for that level.",100,,
333,0.97,2734.731,2738.469,The way we are delivering is more of a Rampup than a peak.,100,,
334,0.97,2738.469,2754.551,"We are entering into the peak of delivery right now, and in addition to that, the design phase of the projects does not spend as much money as the construction phase, and that means it distributes to the curve as well.",100,,
335,0.97,2754.551,2814.511,"With that, after the levy passed in 2015, it was when inflation really started to take off, and so both the kind of broad, not always specific expectations that were in the original levy language, as well as cost explorations, they led the Mayor to challenge us to say, I want you to take a firm look at the levy program, and be really honest and transparent about what you can deliver with the money and funds you have, and that included changing expectations of grant and leverage opportunities as well as some of the changes in the transit modality program, and the expectations were rapid run on all 7-Quarters, and that didn't necessarily line up with the funding we had or even King County Metro's funding time line and plans.",100,,
336,0.97,2814.511,2872.803,"Those types of issues are what we did a full complete assessment of, and then published in November of 2018 the work plan that details where we are able to meet all of the original expectations, and that's the majority of the programs, as far as core number of programs, but also the places we feel as though we are expecting to fall short because of the funds that we have available to be able to do it, and so we did that in November 2018, and what we have been doing since, and Rachel will, you know give the summary update of details of that, working to rebuild the trust and transparency in both of what we share as well as prove our ability to deliver on the levy.",100,,
337,0.97,2872.803,2876.273,So 2019 was a rebuilding year for us for the levy.,100,,
338,0.97,2876.273,2882.713,"Taking over and a slight transition of moving on from the delivery, moving on from the background.",101,,
339,0.97,2882.713,2902.165,"Starting with I call them the three big levy bridges, some of the biggest investments in the portfolio, each unique in their own right, very Transformational, and this month and last month, all underway, and that's a big milestone for the portfolio.",101,,
340,0.97,2902.165,2907.738,First the land bridge that has about 19.5 levy funds.,101,,
341,0.97,2907.738,2916.213,It's building a new Overpass in Soto to connect people in all modes over the active rail tracks down there.,101,,
342,0.97,2916.213,2922.419,"That project has been in construction since 2018, and it will wrap up later this year.",101,,
343,0.97,2922.419,2931.929,Then the Fairview bridge we started construction on last year is replacing the last timber vehicle bridge in Seattle.,101,,
344,0.97,2931.929,2954.251,"That's over in the East Lake neighborhood, closing traffic in September of last year, pretty major milestone as well, and then third, the North gate head bridge, and we are celebrating later today with the Mayor and Councilmembers, it it's starting construction to build a new walking and Biking connection to connect the committees on both sides of the freeway into the Lightrail station coming up there.",101,,
345,0.97,2954.251,2960.857,"If you can believe it, I have been working on the North gate bridge since 2014, so job well done.",102,,
346,0.97,2960.857,2963.16,"Yeah, you're not alone.",103,,
347,0.97,2965.028,2966.363,It's very exciting.,103,,
348,0.97,2966.363,2981.645,"I eluded to earlier, the kind of process of design and Ramping up to these big steps, and the fact that the three major bridge projects are part of the levy are now all under construction Taxer huge thing for us.",103,,
349,0.97,2981.645,2983.313,Fulfilling on what we committed to.,103,,
350,0.97,2987.651,2994.624,Pivoting a little bit from the capital projects to the Nitty- gritty maintenance we mentioned.,103,,
351,0.97,2994.624,3023.487,"One slide is certainly not enough justice for these, but as an example, highlights, some maintenance programs, funded by the levy, including the paving programs, and both Sdot crew delivered work, and to date we have delivered a little over 34 miles, land miles, as well as the larger capital projects delivered by contractors, and to date we have delivered over 80 miles.",103,,
352,0.97,3023.487,3041.772,"We are also building new curb ramps, since 2016, about 540, Restriping the Crosswalks on a 4-year or better cycle and planting trees with the levy to date total of about 1500.",103,,
353,0.97,3041.772,3058.555,"Vision zero is another program we want to highlight, and this is obviously a very important program, and I should say throughout, we are giving highlights on a lot of things that represent a large amount of Sdot's work so the Department can can come back for further detail beyond this high level swath.",103,,
354,0.97,3058.555,3087.818,"The vision zero program does a lot of things, of course, as part of the levy specifically, safety corridor projects, large scale multimillion dollar investments like those on 65Th, northeast 65Th Street and Rainier Avenue South, and also smaller traditional projects including signal timing improvements, Crosswalks, and turn restrictions --",103,,
355,0.97,3087.818,3091.488,"I just want to Interject here, too.",104,,
356,0.97,3091.488,3135.465,"I think Rachel said this, but vision zero is the example of the program that crosses over from the levy to other funds and programs within Sdot, and so it's often a challenging communication piece for the Department to explain how all of these different complex moving parts fit together, and this is an example of how we make investments through the levy that advance the larger goal and program of vision zero that is also leveraged with other funds that are not necessarily capital infrastructure that are around education and sign replacement and things like that, they don't end up in the levy reporting, but part of the important vision zero reporting overall.",104,,
357,0.97,3137.701,3163.894,"All right, and next we have the new sidewalk and bike safety programs, and very important parts of the portfolio, showing some of the levy to date totals, and I should also mentioned, noted on the slide, but since we are ahead of putting together the 2019 comprehensive end of the year report, the levy totals are everything we have done so far through Q3 of last year.",105,,
358,0.97,3163.894,3170.333,We will have more on the 2019 year end in a few months.,105,,
359,0.97,3170.333,3188.652,"Sidewalks we have built over 100 blocks, and so far citywide since 2016, including both traditional, concrete curb and gutter sidewalks and cost effective walkways which are much less costly and carve out the pedestrian space with asphalt and curb stops and the like.",105,,
360,0.97,3188.652,3190.053,Do you have a question?,105,,
361,0.97,3190.053,3193.49,Just complimenting you on anything we can do to move faster.,106,,
362,0.97,3193.49,3204.568,"We have so many parts of our city North end and South end, and District 6, District 5, District 4, that still need sidewalks, so thank you.",106,,
363,0.97,3204.568,3205.101,Thank you.,107,,
364,0.97,3205.101,3237.467,"And also about 115 safe routes to school projects, of course, near schools doing similar work with the sidewalk segments and crossing improvements, and the bike program, combined between neighborhood Greenways, protected Bikeways, and regular bike lanes over 30 miles so far since 2016, and of course, earlier in 2019, the bike program put out the 2019-2020 implementation plan which outlines 50 more miles to be built with available funding through the remaining years of the levy.",108,,
365,0.97,3245.609,3267.964,"And then transit plus, another vision zero, huge aspect of the delivery we can come back to give more detail on, but these are the seven rapid ride and transit plus Multicorridor routes with the levy, and the status as of last year.",108,,
366,0.97,3267.964,3272.102,"Madison and Delridge being the Furthest along, looking for construction this year.",108,,
367,0.97,3272.102,3345.275,"Additional comments for that, the current state, in addition to the bridges, these corridor projects, they are the large projects that we are delivering with the levy, and seeing this move forward will also help us continue to spend and invest the money in the levy, and as far as the project specifically Dellridge is expected to go later this month for construction, and the expectation, and we are submitting a memo to Council before then that is in response to the proviso passed last year, and Bewill detail all the things we have done on the project between 90% to 100%, to answer questions we were asked by the Council the last time we presented on Delridge that is forth coming and something to look forward, and Madison, E.O.T., we continue to work with the F.T.A.",109,,
368,0.97,3345.275,3393.923,"To advance towards readiness, basically the point the FTA says yes, you done everything you need to do to show you can deliver this project, and we therefore will proceed with working to get you a grant agreement, so that is where we have been spending most of our efforts on that project recently, and again, the communication with the FTA and regularly providing them updated documents that respond to the comments we have received from them about the things they want to see us do to prove us ready for the project, and then, Roosevelt, and last but not least, is actually currently in Republished E.A., and it's--Council member Pedersen, you know, we have talked about it, but an E.A.",109,,
369,0.97,3393.923,3397.193,"Comment period, and the comment period for the E.A.",109,,
370,0.97,3397.193,3445.975,"Closes February 14th on Valentine's day, and so that is where that project is at, and we are definitely in advancement of the larger corridors, and we have begun design on the other four corridors, but our--a little different in that they are not the four rapid ride delivery, and they don't have FTA grants we are pursuing for them, but they are Corridorwide improvements, and things such as stop improvements, transit, signal priority, Cue jumps, sidewalk improvements, and all things that help with the speed and reliability of the transit systems and the corridor.",109,,
371,0.97,3445.975,3446.676,Councilmember Strauss.,110,,
372,0.97,3446.676,3456.886,"Since the levy reset, I have been very impressed with all the work that Sdot has done to allow reliable travel times.",111,,
373,0.97,3456.886,3461.591,"When you go to the bus, you know how long it will take you to get to where you're going.",111,,
374,0.97,3461.591,3463.993,I know there's a number of additional improvements.,111,,
375,0.97,3463.993,3472.836,"There was a spot I was on the bus this morning, and it's always in gridlock, and I know, and I am confident in your work to address this.",111,,
376,0.97,3472.836,3475.672,Thank you very much for all you're doing.,111,,
377,0.97,3475.672,3476.105,Definitely.,112,,
378,0.97,3476.105,3493.423,"This is not in the slides, but off the cuff comment, there has ban been a lot of effort and movement towards a very well evolved partnership with us and King County Metro.",113,,
379,0.97,3493.423,3506.236,"Something both teams have led, and it's been exciting to see, and these corridors are one way that has been highlighted how successful we can be when we work really well together with us and King County Metro.",113,,
380,0.97,3506.236,3515.411,"I'm making notes along the way, and maybe I will just lay them all out, and you can address them as appropriate.",114,,
381,0.97,3515.411,3519.516,"So district 2, obviously has the most dangerous street in the city.",114,,
382,0.97,3519.516,3527.857,"This continues to be the case, and we just had an accident in Columbia city two Fridays ago.",114,,
383,0.97,3527.857,3531.961,My questions are about safety.,114,,
384,0.97,3531.961,3567.964,"And I would like to know how this work--I don't see reference to the fact that we still have a serious problem on Rainier Avenue, so I would like to knowhow these projects and the delivery connects with the effort to actually reduce accidents, you know, incidents for pedestrians and cyclists, and what we are doing to make sure that folks on Rainier, and also or sorry Rainier Avenue, and across the city, know it's really a priority.",114,,
385,0.97,3567.964,3596.059,"I think, for me, the ability to increase reliable transit is key to making sure that we are able to get folks across the city a I cross town, not just commuters, but people are able to rely on public transportation to get around and do the Errands they need to do in their neighborhoods, whether they are on the bus or in my district, we have a lot of visual Impairments, and they use Wheelchairs.",114,,
386,0.97,3596.059,3599.495,"They need to get around too, and they need to do it safely.",114,,
387,0.97,3599.495,3629.759,"We need to slow traffic down on the major Arterials, and that's a challenge, but that's a huge issue in our district, and so I want to understand how crosswalk installation, not just maintenance, but installing new Crosswalks across some of the major Arterials is considered, and I want to know how kids can walk to school safety.",114,,
388,0.97,3629.759,3657.086,"I should know this, but I don't, the percentage of bike lanes relative to our bike master plan and what the plan is for increasing that, and then with regards to the rapid ride on the Southern, that is--you know, controversial, and the seven a huge--it has high Ridership, and people don't use it just to commute into downtown.",114,,
389,0.97,3657.086,3671.367,"People use it for the grocery store, go to day care and go to their doctor, and it's important we not lose stops.",114,,
390,0.97,3671.367,3673.97,People need to get off frequently.,114,,
391,0.97,3673.97,3691.788,"The question, is there can consideration to the local that will make more stops along the way if people are not just trying to get through quickly to come to work downtown, and those are the questions, and we can follow up on them, those are the things I'm thinking about as we think about making sure people get around their community safety.",114,,
392,0.97,3691.788,3703.032,"I think they are great questions, and some of them we may want to follow up at the committee or separately.",115,,
393,0.97,3703.032,3769.232,"I think you're highlights also where what we do through the levy is one set of activities, and it's about 30% of our overall budget through the levy, but there's a lot of other things that are going on in terms of how we use--how we Prioritize the levy funds and other investments around safety issues, we have developed the bicycle and pedestrian safety assessment which is a Proactive tool, one of only a couple of cities in the country, really the first to develop the tool to try to look at where crashes have happened across the city, and then use that to Proactively look at places that have the similar conditions, and there may not be reported crashes, and there may not be or may not have had crashes, but have the conditions that are likely to indicate crash in the future, and try to target and Prioritize our investments in safety for people walking and Biking in those places which highlights the investments we have and continue to make all along Rainier and broader Rainier Valley and overall.",115,,
394,0.97,3769.232,3783.112,"We have made consistent improvements, some happening through various different programs, and then we have additional major safety investments going on with Rainier over the course of the year.",115,,
395,0.97,3783.112,3789.619,"Some of the funds through the Seattle benefit transportation district, not the levy in Seattle.",115,,
396,0.97,3789.619,3799.729,"We are always managing the various buckets of funding that we are using, and then also trying to report on very clearly through the levy oversight committee and the reporting we do there.",115,,
397,0.97,3799.729,3800.429,Thank you.,116,,
398,0.97,3804.934,3805.067,.,116,,
399,0.97,3805.067,3807.87,Yeah that about says it all.,117,,
400,0.97,3807.87,3834.03,"[Laughter] just another couple of thoughts I had was accessibility, Baker is another area we are doing specific bicycle and pedestrian work funded through a program in the levy also to address some of that, and then, the levy regular reporting on both the bike master plan and implementation plan, and it overlaps with our levy reporting and what we plan to get done.",117,,
401,0.97,3834.03,3836.632,You will see it in both places and formats.,117,,
402,0.97,3836.632,3839.835,To make sure I don't Miss the slide I almost missed.,117,,
403,0.97,3839.835,3875.037,"Thank you, Rachel, and so this is an example of the type of information we share in our quarterly reports and the level of detail we have shifted to, and what you can can see on the left is our annual spending trend, and it speaks to what I was talking about earlier, how it started slower, and that's increasing, and through Q3 of 2019, we were at 556 million in total, and that's against the 1.8 that we had in the earlier slide, including leverage of local funds, not just the $930 million levy.",117,,
404,0.97,3875.037,3880.009,"On the right hand side, you can see the quarterly spend.",117,,
405,0.97,3880.009,3888.351,"What we do every year, and this is San interesting task, but we have definitely improved upon.",117,,
406,0.97,3888.351,3895.291,"Our projects don't just have one isolated specific year, but our fending plans do.",117,,
407,0.97,3895.291,3981.711,"Last year we went through the rigorous process to identify the spending plan and assess risk, so that if we have the risk of not spending the money, we shifted the money into later years, and we also represented our spend plan for 2019 with a range, and instead of just having one number, and the chances of us hitting like one single number, pretty much zero, and we Give190 to $218 million range for what we expected to spend for 2019, and we are still finalizing all of our 2019 numbers, and it will come out in the annual report, and that's why Q4 is not filled in here, but preliminary numbers, we exceeded the 73.7 Expeced, and that is in some ways the balance of what we didn't do in Q3, and we think we will be right about the higher end of the range, and so, and the good thing, spend is important, but spend without the Deliverables to back it up, it could mean you're spending too much, and so the good news is that our spend is in alignment with the deliverable projections and predictions we have, and we are feeling very good about what we did in 2019, and we are excited about the annual report and being able to present to you and the oversight committee with that, and looking to continue that effort in 2020 and beyond.",117,,
408,0.97,3981.711,3984.246,And then I have one more slide for Rachel.,117,,
409,0.97,3987.85,3990.319,So moving on to levy reporting.,118,,
410,0.97,3990.319,4005.701,"So as part of the feedback from the 2018 assessment, and this need to be more transparent, clearer, more consistent, and really accountable to what we are delivering and spending, we have a new report format, not so new anymore.",118,,
411,0.97,4005.701,4053.482,"I have been doing it a little over a year now, and I have a library of documents, and so it's a quarterly report that goes through some of the financials like Lorelei just went through and the deliverable progress, and put out quarterly on a regular schedule as noted here to get at the consistent and reliable expectation, and the quarterly reports are against the one year's deliverable and spend plan, and they are kind of a Snapshot in time against that amount, and the annual report, which is what we are working on for 2019 is a cumulative look at the levy totals since 2016, and so, the annual report should come out March 30th, and we will share with the oversight committee and here as well.",118,,
412,0.97,4053.482,4075.771,"Those are the two categories of progress, dock Mennation, documentation, and we have the remaining years of the levy, what is to be delivered, and we are looking at the performance status document update, a realistic look since 2 years have passed since the work plan.",118,,
413,0.97,4075.771,4076.539,Thank you.,119,,
414,0.97,4079.942,4089.218,"And then last but definitely not least, the levy oversight committee, which you're particular with Councilmember as a committee member now.",120,,
415,0.97,4089.218,4111.34,"The committee is a group of 16 members, including the chair of transportation Committee, city budget director, and Seattle the residents appointed by the city Council and Mayor, and they are an advisory body that reviews project implementation, Expenditureses and provides recommendations to the city Council and Mayor.",120,,
416,0.97,4111.34,4154.049,"As we have kind of talked about over the last 15 minute the or so, turned a leaf in 2019 to be working more closely with them, more often, and we meet about monthly, 10 time as year, and we meet with Subcommittees, prepare materials, and responses to information requests and Whatnot, and put out these reports on a more reliable schedule to be more in coordination with them, and I would like to reintroduce Rachel Ben Shmuel one of our Coshares Cochairs of the levy overnight committee.",120,,
417,0.97,4154.049,4154.884,"Good morning, Councilmembers.",120,,
418,0.97,4154.884,4169.498,"I have been on the committee since 2016 in its inception, and since the reset, there has been vast improvement in the levy oversight committee relationship with Sdot.",120,,
419,0.97,4169.498,4178.007,"It was kind of tough going at first, but particularly there's been improvements since 2019.",120,,
420,0.97,4178.007,4187.516,"Here are the steps we have taken, and there's a more stream lined review process.",120,,
421,0.97,4187.516,4228.023,"There's more consistent reporting from Sdot staff on projects and budgets, and the reporting format itself is more Comprehensible, and to accomplish this, both as Lorelei and Rachel said, we are meeting more frequently and setting up Subcommittees, and finally, you know, as a result of all of these steps, there's been I think considerable trust of Sdot by the levy oversight committee, a huge change since the reset.",120,,
422,0.97,4228.023,4246.942,"Thank you for your service, and it was great to be there last night and thank everyone there for their volunteering on this, and they had really great questions asked by the oversight committee members, and Sdot had answers, and it was great to see them functioning well last night.",121,,
423,0.97,4246.942,4249.345,"Rachel, I can't thank you enough.",122,,
424,0.97,4249.345,4260.623,"I share your thoughts and feelings about how things have changed since the reset, and the reset did come under our current director, possibly?",122,,
425,0.97,4262.324,4287.116,"And you know, the troubles that you and I had shared previous to this were under an Sdot director that is no longer here, and so I really want to compliment the director's leadership and the entire team's leadership in being able to communities the documents and create outcomes we can all see and enjoy.",122,,
426,0.97,4287.116,4287.516,Yeah.,123,,
427,0.97,4287.516,4288.217,Thank you.,124,,
428,0.97,4292.655,4292.821,.,124,,
429,0.97,4292.821,4317.246,"And just one other note, we tentatively plan to come talk to this committee every quart tore go flu the quarterly report, but I want to make sure each of you knew at any time, if you have a project or part of the levy that you want to spend time in and dig deeper with us, we are happy to meet with you at any point.",125,,
430,0.97,4317.246,4317.579,Thank you.,126,,
431,0.97,4317.579,4331.827,"You will receive a letter from the oversight Committee on reflecting in 2019, one of the issues raised last year was the previous city council adding projects and responsibilities to the oversight committee with the T.N.C.",127,,
432,0.97,4331.827,4352.147,"Funding and adding seven projects, and so, I think the levy oversight committee was getting a handle on those and appropriately asking a lot of questions those hoping the city council does not pile on projects but sticks to what the goals were from the actual move Seattle levy is what I was hearing last night.",127,,
433,0.97,4352.147,4355.317,We will see that formally in a letter that will be coming.,127,,
434,0.97,4355.317,4386.281,"I think it's important to keep the focus, and I mean we have added to the TNC, but there is so much to review at this point that it's really important that, you know, that the committee has a grasp on the range of everything that Sdot is doing, and so that it can report appropriately.",128,,
435,0.97,4386.281,4387.983,Thank you.,129,,

460,0.97,4499.027,4503.732,I'm Tom Deborn incoming manager at City light.,144,,
461,0.97,4503.732,4508.403,And I'm Kate Ingle.,145,,
462,0.97,4508.403,4517.846,And I'm Randall Strouted a adaptation adviser.,146,,
463,0.97,4517.846,4519.414,Thank you for being here.,147,,
464,0.97,4519.414,4523.752,I will turn to over to the meat of the presentation.,147,,
465,0.97,4523.752,4539.868,"Kate is the manager of the science policy group or science policy division that manages the science, deep science work, and one of the projects that came up is this climate assessment and adaptation project, and Rhonda is the scientist doing the world.",147,,
466,0.97,4539.868,4543.839,"I will turn it over to her, and she will go through the presentation.",147,,
467,0.97,4543.839,4544.206,Thank you.,148,,
468,0.97,4544.206,4546.141,Thank you very much for having me here.,149,,
469,0.97,4546.141,4561.189,I'm glad to be able to tell you about the Seattle city light efforts on addressing climate change from an adaptation Pespective rather than the greenhouse gas emission.,149,,
470,0.97,4561.189,4563.659,I will talk about the adaptation plan we developed.,149,,
471,0.97,4567.896,4602.097,"So in our 2013-2018 strategic plan, we launched a climate initiative, and in that climate initiative, we had three primary components to it, climate change adviser to staff the initiative, to identify a research program to research the climate change impacts on the utility, and also develop a Utilitywide adaptation plan.",149,,
472,0.97,4602.097,4615.31,"In 2017 we completed our plan, and this plan had three primary aspects to it, and first, identifying observed and potential changes in climate.",149,,
473,0.97,4615.31,4627.656,"Evaluating potential impacts and assessing the vulnerability of our utility to those impacts, and third to develop the a Deputation and strategies to help minimize the impacts.",149,,
474,0.97,4627.656,4634.296,So this figure will give you an overview and picture of what the vulnerability assessment is contained.,149,,
475,0.97,4634.296,4677.072,"At the bottom, five different business domains, or, like functions and assets that the city, Seattle city light owns and manages, and at the top, there's different climate stressors, and eight we focused on, and those are including the sea level rise and storm surge, warmer temperatures, and more frequent heat waves, and extreme weather patterns, and increases in wild fire risks, landslides and Erosions, and we also looked at reduction because of the warmer temperatures and how it may change the stream inflow to the reservoirs, and we looked at higher peak flows because of the increasing Downpours and how it can affect our flood risk.",149,,
476,0.97,4677.072,4690.152,"On the flip side during the summer, with the warmer temperatures, and drier, less precipitation, the summer, longer drought period, and how is that going to affect the stream flows and reservoirs?",149,,
477,0.97,4690.152,4700.762,"So we were on the bottom, the list, but there's the five domains we looked at.",149,,
478,0.97,4700.762,4712.174,"Shoreline infrastructure, electricity demand, hydroelectric projects, the fish has and restoration.",149,,
479,0.97,4712.174,4717.245,It was the impact Pathway we can address.,149,,
480,0.97,4717.245,4757.419,"So our approach to doing this assessment that the exposure for the different functions or domains and how sensitive they were to different climate stressors, and then we looked at--that gave us the idea of the potential impact, and then we looked at Adaptive capacity, and we looked at our business practices and operations and policies, things that can help to reduce the impacts from extreme weather events, and how can we potentially address those potential impacts already in our business, and that gave us an idea of what the vulnerability was, and we undertook this assessment looking, how is the climate change going to affect our mission?",149,,
481,0.97,4757.419,4763.191,"Our mission currently, although you heard from Debra Smith, I'm sorry she couldn't be here today.",149,,
482,0.97,4763.191,4775.904,"That's our general manager, and we will be updating our mission, but currently deliver affordable, reliable, and responsible electricity services to our customers.",149,,
483,0.97,4775.904,4787.415,"This is a very elaborate diagram, but it's extracted from our climate plan, available Online, a public document, and it gives you an idea of how we did the vulnerability assessment.",149,,
484,0.97,4787.415,4791.787,"For the interest of time, I'm going to go through one example on the table.",149,,
485,0.97,4791.787,4796.124,"We have different business domains, functions on the left, and this example.",149,,
486,0.97,4796.124,4825.554,"Transmission and distribution system, and really impact the pathways we observe the or identified as potential concern is more damaging in the interrupt of transmission and generation to the risk, and then we looked at what are the vulnerability, two different time frames of exposure because climate change is expected to worsen over time, and we are looking at a new term exposure.",149,,
487,0.97,4825.554,4831.359,We look at the how sensitive the transmission distributions are to those and what is our act of capacity.,149,,
488,0.97,4831.359,4836.231,"You see the different colored dots there, and those are like a traffic light.",149,,
489,0.97,4836.231,4858.153,"Green is we are looking good, low ranking for that vulnerability category, and yell slow moderate, and red is something we need to really pay attention to, it's a higher ranking, and then on the far right, those with the magnitude to the emission, and then we looked at financial costs, safety, reliability, and responsibility.",149,,
490,0.97,4858.153,4869.965,"In this case, for transmission or wild fire, something that looks like it's going to worsen, our exposure will worsen over time, and we have sensitivity to it, currently, and things can burn up.",149,,
491,0.97,4869.965,4879.574,And then we also have some Adaptive capacity in order to minimize that through some of our vegetation management actions.,149,,
492,0.97,4879.574,4889.351,"It could have potential for high cost, high safety issues, and on a moderate concern with reliability, and then in this case, not applicable for environmental responsibility.",149,,
493,0.97,4889.351,4904.699,"It gives you a Snapshot of how we go through the vulnerability assessment process, and in the interest of time, I'm not going to go through all of these in detail, but three examples of the key impacts to different domains.",149,,
494,0.97,4904.699,4913.908,"The Hydropower operations, really looking at how the changes look because of loss of snow pack and how it's going to change more in the winter and less in the summer.",149,,
495,0.97,4915.777,4924.519,Some of the key impacts for the electricity demand is really the shift in the Seasonality.,149,,
496,0.97,4924.519,4940.635,"Warmer, temperatures get warmer, and we expect to see more demand for electricity for cooling in the summer, and then less demand for heating in the winter, and some of the things we saw as an impact from climate change.",149,,
497,0.97,4940.635,4964.092,"And then the wild fire example, the transmission and distribution, and I'm not going through all of these, but we can be impacted by wild fires, landslides, changes in flooding because of the more intense rain fall, and these are some of the things that are the impact pathways we identify in the adaptation plan, and one thing we are very proud of.",149,,
498,0.97,4964.092,4971.9,The plan was the first in the nation to have developed such a comprehensive vulnerability assessment and adaptation plan.,149,,
499,0.97,4971.9,4986.481,Because of that we received an award in 2016 from a consortium of 12 different agencies from NOAA.,149,,
500,0.97,4986.481,4994.255,"We are very proud of that people have been using our adaptation plan, other utilities and agencies as a model.",149,,
501,0.97,4996.658,4999.627,"Given those impacts, and looking at, okay what is the actions?",149,,
502,0.97,4999.627,5003.231,What are things we are actually doing that people care about?,149,,
503,0.97,5003.231,5021.316,"Our implementation of the plan, it includes moving parts, collaboration because it's important to work together to solve the issues, and research, projects and actions, and education, and then we are talking more about the first three.",149,,
504,0.97,5021.316,5025.72,"Education is ongoing, like coming and giving this presentation.",149,,
505,0.97,5025.72,5030.325,"Collaboration, it's very important because climate change is something we need to work on together.",149,,
506,0.97,5030.325,5032.26,We can't just solve it independently.,149,,
507,0.97,5032.26,5056.718,"We are a member of multiple different organizations that are helping to work on this issue, and one is Department of energy's partnership for energy sector climate resilience, and the Federal effort with 16 or 18 other utilities participating, and trying to identify ways we can make our whole U.S. energy sector more secure for the changing climate.",149,,
508,0.97,5056.718,5065.794,We are also involved in Ceati.,149,,

510,0.97,5067.896,5076.371,"We are are looking at how we can adapt to climate change, focusing on the Hydropower operations.",149,,
511,0.97,5076.371,5094.189,"We are Partnering with other folks and research and adaptation, and it includes the Swinomish Indian dry ball community, the Sauk-Suiatte Indian tribe, and National Park service and Usgs and forest services.",149,,
512,0.97,5094.189,5098.793,We have a lot of partners in our implementation plan.,149,,
513,0.97,5098.793,5100.762,The other aspect is research.,149,,
514,0.97,5100.762,5107.368,"We lead it or support it Collaboratively, and Stuplo is very important.",149,,
515,0.97,5107.368,5128.323,"We have been modeling a few of those, and that information is helping with our Skagit hydroelectric plan, and the long-range plan for 20 years, balancing the energy load from customers, and that's the supply from generation or contracts.",149,,
516,0.97,5128.323,5137.732,"We are also doing research on water temperature modeling for reservoirs, and Landsliding in the futures, the hazards will change.",149,,
517,0.97,5137.732,5141.97,We are monitoring and doing research on the glaciers.,149,,

519,0.97,5146.14,5160.588,"We are looking at smoke events, and people have to close their windows and use air conditioners or air filters, and also looking at changes in extremes, temperatures cold or high, and wind, and lightning.",149,,
520,0.97,5160.588,5162.19,Some of the research we are doing.,149,,
521,0.97,5162.19,5167.896,I want to move on to some of the projects.,149,,
522,0.97,5167.896,5186.414,"So wild fire, wild fire is really a concern with wild fire, even before the terrible stories we have heard out of California, and so we have experienced wild fire at one of our facilities, the Skagit project you may have known.",149,,
523,0.97,5186.414,5245.506,"The Goodell Creek fire that threatened our company town and our gorge power house, and it damaged our transmission lines and shut our transmission lines down for about 9 days, and it also shut down highway 20, the access to our facilities, and we had to evacuate our company town of Diablo and the other two Powerhouses, and in the end cost us over $2.5 million in repairs, fire fighting, evacuation, and emergency management, plus an additional $1 million in energy purchases, and you get reimbursed about this, 87.5% from FEMA and the state, because it was an emergency situation, but that event really highlighted how glad we were that we are preparing, and there's more things we can do to secure the infrastructure, working with neighbors for vegetation control.",149,,
524,0.97,5245.506,5265.793,"If I may, I think while we are here in the city, and we have lights and cooling, and we have heating and the amenities of the urban environment, we often forget about the assets that we have throughout our region and in have intense wilderness places.",150,,
525,0.97,5265.793,5277.205,"I was on my way to backpack outside of Diablo, and the Goodell fire occurred it took the lives of a number of firefighters, is that correct?",150,,
526,0.97,5277.205,5278.039,That is correct.,151,,
527,0.97,5278.039,5279.173,I also.,152,,
528,0.97,5279.173,5285.48,To recognize and honor the lives of our firefighters.,152,,
529,0.97,5285.48,5324.986,"When I was AmeriCorps, I was red card certified, and when we look at the transmission line in the Skagit Valley, some are hung between cliffs, above the river, and so while we sit here in our urban environment, and we get to experience the benefits of our infrastructure, I think too often we forget the immense maintenance and operations and resiliency we need because these fires can really take on the infrastructure.",152,,
530,0.97,5324.986,5331.059,The lights stay on here because of the back end work you do at City light.,152,,
531,0.97,5331.059,5331.559,Thank you.,153,,
532,0.97,5331.559,5332.36,We appreciate that.,153,,
533,0.97,5332.36,5349.677,"-- we rely on the entire grid system of power, and all the facilities cutting across the state and passes, and it's just not city light facilities.",154,,
534,0.97,5349.677,5356.651,"Another part of the business is restoring fish habitat, and our Trout species.",155,,
535,0.97,5356.651,5363.391,We purchase the lands in our water sheds and restore them to be resilient today and in the future.,155,,
536,0.97,5363.391,5371.899,"It's our Spousal Creek project, and we are going to be doing the adaptation project on.",155,,
537,0.97,5371.899,5381.676,We will be replanting tree species Sourced from here locally and also from the conditions that are warmer and drier in California and northern California and Oregon.,155,,
538,0.97,5381.676,5383.945,So we will plant those in the next few weeks.,155,,
539,0.97,5383.945,5388.783,Stay tuned to hear more about that project.,155,,

541,0.97,5395.723,5408.403,It's really a good collaboration with universities and with tribes and Skagit science consortium.,155,,
542,0.97,5408.403,5429.023,"It's important to take the science information and put it into something people can use as a tool and to translate the number used in design and long- term planning, and there's two tools now Online, and it's publically available, and it's interactive, and it will give you an example of what to look at.",155,,
543,0.97,5429.023,5448.176,"You pull up the tool, select the reservoir site and look at how the monthly stream flow has looks in the future compared to historic, and you can also look at a different time in the future like later in the century to see if it's going to be the same, getting worse?",155,,
544,0.97,5448.176,5460.087,And we can use plants and an engineer can plant a Culvert from an access road to have it last into the the future flow change.,155,,
545,0.97,5460.087,5484.979,"So Lastly, this adaptation plan has been in place for about 5 years, implementing it, but it's about time to check on the information that is out there and update the plan, and this includes advancements in climate data and impacts and new strategies and priorities and action implementation plan portion of it, and then adding metric Baselines.",155,,
546,0.97,5484.979,5487.982,Stay tuned to hear more about that in the coming year.,155,,
547,0.97,5487.982,5489.217,"With that, any questions?",155,,

549,0.97,5491.886,5513.14,"I think Seattle city light is one of our best assets to be able to fight climate change and the climate crisis as we know we have about 10 years, maybe 12 years at most to make very large behavioral changes in how we operate and live, and otherwise, this world may not be habitable.",156,,
550,0.97,5513.14,5518.279,We are already 50 years past climate change being a known entity --,156,,

552,0.97,5518.913,5544.138,"And we have only really started to address it in a meaningful way in Maybe the last 5 years, and we have had many climate action plans that have missed the marks, Underperformed, and if we don't, that's because we have been Nipping and tucking around the edges, if we don't make large-scale, bold changes to the way we live, we will not be able to.",158,,
553,0.97,5544.138,5544.438,Right.,159,,
554,0.97,5544.438,5568.863,"And with the forest restoration, the salmon habitat restoration, the way we are able it to generate energy without creating carbon emissions, granted I have some other comments, but I will save that for another day, it really is the full Ecosystem we need to be looking at and the way, and I'm just so proud of city light for being the greenest utility in the nation, and I'm just really proud of your work.",160,,
555,0.97,5568.863,5579.64,I look forward to working with you because the city has to make some pretty whole scale changes to address the climate crisis.,160,,
556,0.97,5579.64,5579.907,Great.,161,,
557,0.97,5579.907,5581.208,Anything?,162,,

559,0.97,5583.11,5583.744,Okay.,164,,
560,0.97,5583.744,5616.677,"And then the city council is going to be doing, hopefully, while you're doing the ground breaking Wort work with city light, we are going to be looking at every piece of legislation, asking about emissions and climate a adaptation.",165,,
561,0.97,5616.677,5622.016,We will benefit from the work you're doing on the ground.,165,,

563,0.97,5630.524,5632.326,I'm interested in where our electricity comes from.,166,,

565,0.97,5640.468,5649.644,"Given the increased demand, can you talk about what the plan is for addressing that and what it means for where our electricity needs to come from, what the plans are for addressing that?",166,,
566,0.97,5649.644,5652.213,You want many to address that?,167,,
567,0.97,5652.213,5652.58,Go ahead.,168,,

570,0.97,5662.857,5677.004,"Generally speaking we are anticipating as transportation Electrifies our load, buildings, all Electrify cases will cause an increase in our load even though over the last few years because of conservation it's been decreasing.",169,,
571,0.97,5677.004,5681.375,"We are anticipating that growing, and the pace of growth is the question.",169,,
572,0.97,5681.375,5687.882,"We anticipate it will be fairly slow growing, but that probably depends more on what you do than what we do.",169,,
573,0.97,5687.882,5692.119,"Where that is going to come from, we don't have a lot of choices in the state.",169,,
574,0.97,5692.119,5695.79,It's going to have to be renewable.,169,,
575,0.97,5695.79,5717.111,"Fossil fuels are no longer allowed or being phased out it will have to be wind, solar, or other storage technologies, and those are the only options, and you know, everybody is doing that Puget sound energy has to transform their fleet from you know, a heavy fossil fuel to less, and we are all in that same market, and it's going to be very challenging.",169,,
576,0.97,5717.111,5733.961,"I was just reading an article this morning from Hawaii where they have having a challenge because of the land, wind, and solar, and transmission will be a huge issue, and wild fires a huge issue for transmission.",169,,

581,0.97,5747.875,5769.196,"Well, I just want to say we--I woke up to the article, I'm sure we all saw it about the push to just get rid of Gas- powered cars at all and how it was a crazy idea when it was first discussed, and how there's ten legislators in Olympia signing on to the bill, and I don't know it's going to pass.",173,,
582,0.97,5769.196,5801.295,"It seems unlikely, but I want to encourage us all to continue to think boldly about what we need to do this is a crisis, and I have told the story many times, but my 12-year-old son is worried he's not going to make it to 25 because he knows we only have 12 years before we have a real crisis on our hands, a catastrophe, and so that's always in my mind as I'm thinking of what we can do at the jurisdiction, the jurisdiction level to make sure we are protecting the future for our kids.",173,,
