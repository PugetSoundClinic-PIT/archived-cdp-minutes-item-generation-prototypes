268,0.8317734599113464,1031.2,1040.2,And I want to First say I'm happy to have the opportunity to vote in favor of this nomination in this.,,,
269,0.9019347429275513,1040.4,1057.9," Been all discussed in the committee discussion, my apologies, if it's repetitive for those committee members, but I did want to provide a little additional background on this particular property, the tenants of this property along with the original owner.",,,
270,0.9019347429275513,1058.3,1064.9,Actually organized to apply for this Landmark designation in part to protect their affordable homes.,,,
271,0.9019347429275513,1065.3,1070.1,And last fall when this building went up for sale the tenants organize them.,,,
272,0.8468407988548279,1070.3,1078.3, Then in an attempt to gain time to explore purchasing that building and their efforts attracted some media attention.,,,
273,0.8468407988548279,1078.5,1094.5,"My office reached out to the office of housing, about this particular organizing effort, because it seemed likely that, the owner was not in compliance with the legal obligations.",,,
274,0.8468407988548279,1094.6,1100.2,"Under the notice of intent to sale to sell legislation, which actually requires",,,
275,0.8202475309371948,1100.5,1106.2, Owners of affordable rental housing to notify the city office of housing.,,,
276,0.8202475309371948,1106.2,1108.0,When the property is put up for sale.,,,
277,0.8202475309371948,1109.0,1119.1,"We did actually confirm that that was indeed the case, the office of housing did reach out to the owner and determine that the intent to sail Provisions were.",,,
278,0.8202475309371948,1119.1,1120.5,"In fact, required.",,,
279,0.8202475309371948,1121.2,1123.9,And eventually under the office housings coaching.,,,
280,0.8202475309371948,1123.9,1129.2,"The owner did file the required paperwork, which then triggered a 30-day waiting period.",,,
281,0.8202475309371948,1129.3,1130.1,The goal.,,,
282,0.884681761264801,1130.6,1141.5, During that period of time is for tenants or other interested parties such as affordable housing developers to submit to the owners a letter of interest to buy the building.,,,
283,0.884681761264801,1142.1,1150.6,Unfortunately that was not enough time for these tenants to make an offer on the property and ultimately the property.,,,
284,0.884681761264801,1150.6,1160.1,"And two adjacent properties were sold to a new owner, although the landmark designation protects the exterior including the roof.",,,
285,0.8239909410476685,1160.3,1163.0," Well, as the landscaping and pathways on the site.",,,
286,0.8239909410476685,1164.2,1173.3,My Hope Is that this since the designation will somehow help the tenants in their continuing efforts to avoid eviction and displacement.,,,
287,0.8239909410476685,1173.5,1190.1,"And I think this particular example of what occurred with this building, is a powerful motivator for, for the council exploring, how we might work together to strengthen the know.",,,
288,0.7439380884170532,1190.2,1192.3, Notice of intent to sell Provisions.,,,
289,0.7439380884170532,1193.3,1199.3,I know that we'll be receiving a report from the office of Housing and SDC eye on that particular topic.,,,
290,0.7439380884170532,1199.3,1204.6,"Thanks to statement of legislative intent, authored by council member maaske, Ada.",,,
291,0.7439380884170532,1204.6,1215.9,"But again, it's clear that the notice of intent Provisions are not giving interested, tenants enough opportunity.",,,
292,0.7439380884170532,1216.5,1220.1,This is an example of definitely motivated.,,,
293,0.8289686441421509,1221.4,1226.9," And just it's I think a good object lesson for our policy development future of this would say, so.",,,
