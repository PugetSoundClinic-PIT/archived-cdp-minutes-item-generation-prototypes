178,0.97,1083.449,1098.163,"As the members know, over the past months, we have voted to propose previous drafts of the legislation and I have repeatedly requested that Councilmember Morales join my office in the bill.",39,,
179,0.97,1098.163,1101.099,And I am pleased the Councilmember agreed to do so.,39,,
180,0.97,1101.099,1110.142,And this draft establishes a right of first refusal for Renters to sign a new lease so that the landlords cannot kick them out for no reason.,39,,
181,0.97,1110.142,1120.953,"60 to 90 days before the end of the lease, a landlord would have to offer a new lease or present a just cause for refusing to do so.",39,,
182,0.97,1120.953,1125.791,And the Seattle Department of construction and inspections is empowered to enforce that requirement.,39,,
183,0.97,1125.791,1134.133,The goal is for Renters to resolve these issues and get a new lease far in advance of the end of their old lease.,39,,
184,0.97,1134.133,1142.808,"If this bill is enforced well, tenants should never need to defend themselves in Eviction court against an unjust end to heir lease.",39,,
185,0.97,1142.808,1156.722,We hope to have this draft of the legislation introduced today so that it can be available for a vote at tomorrow's Sustainability and Renters rights community meeting on the previously decided schedule.,39,,
186,0.97,1156.722,1168.534,The committee has been discussing this issue of ensuring full just cause protections for Seattle's Renters for its last three committee meetings since March.,39,,
187,0.97,1168.534,1171.003,"And normally, this would be an amendment.",39,,
188,0.97,1171.003,1173.939,"However, this draft includes a title change.",39,,
189,0.97,1173.939,1179.912,"So it requires new legislation to be introduced, which is what we are proposing today.",39,,
190,0.97,1179.912,1189.188,I hope the members support the inclusion of the bill to the calendar today so it is available for the committee tomorrow.,39,,
191,0.97,1189.188,1193.926,I appreciate Councilmember Lewis Cosponsoring the bill.,39,,
192,0.97,1193.926,1202.868,"And as I mentioned, I really appreciate the work of Roger Wynn and Clara park from the city attorney's office.",39,,
193,0.97,1202.868,1219.952,And the central staff and Devin and Ted from Councilmember Morales' office and my office respectively for working on the legislation last week and through the weekend to make it available for introduction today.,39,,
194,0.97,1219.952,1221.92,And I invite Councilmember Morales.,39,,
195,0.97,1221.92,1222.321,Thank you so much.,39,,
196,0.97,1222.454,1225.123,Thanks so much.,40,,
197,0.97,1225.123,1231.129,It's been moved and Seconded to amend the calendar to introduce Council bill 120090.,40,,
198,0.97,1231.129,1234.566,And by referring it to the Sustainability and rights committee.,40,,
199,0.97,1234.566,1241.473,Will the clerk please call the roll for the adoption of the amendment?,40,,
200,0.97,1241.473,1242.474,Council President Protestimony.,41,,

210,0.97,1256.922,1257.589,That's okay.,45,,
211,0.97,1257.589,1261.326,I wanted to make a couple of remarks and appreciate it.,45,,
212,0.97,1261.326,1271.637,So I do want to thank colleagues for allowing us to amend the IRC and add this time sensitive legislation to the calendar.,45,,
213,0.97,1271.637,1276.808,"As we have mentioned, Úcouncilmember Sawant and I have had been working on competing legislation to solve this issue.",45,,
214,0.97,1276.808,1285.25,And this bill I think really combines the best of those efforts while also heeding the advice from law and from Sdci.,45,,
215,0.97,1285.25,1297.496,This will provide a right of first refusal for tenants to sign a new lease or month to month contract and provides a tenant can voluntarily leave.,45,,
216,0.97,1297.496,1307.339,But may not be involuntarily removed unless a just cause exists.,45,,
217,0.97,1307.339,1308.64,Thank you for your joint sponsorship.,45,,
218,0.97,1308.64,1316.481,And just want to say thank you again to earn who has worked on helping us pull this together.,45,,

220,0.97,1320.852,1327.426,And of course to the community who has been organizing to make sure that we are pushing this legislation forward.,45,,

227,0.97,1340.505,1363.862,"I want to briefly mention that I support in this case the procedural approach of adding it on and suspending the rules given--as the comments of the son support Councilmember Sawant earlier, I want to echo that the legislation is very in keeping with the debate and discussion we have had in the Renters rights committee.",47,,
228,0.97,1363.862,1380.612,"So I do think that this is a suitable procedural move to sub this in as a substitute bill to just deal with the reality that when a title change is included, it needs to be in a proposal.",47,,
229,0.97,1380.612,1384.549,Just in case there's folks worried we're moving too fast.,47,,
230,0.97,1384.549,1388.687,It is in keeping with the previous discussions.,47,,
231,0.97,1388.687,1393.725,It's a Reworked way of essentially accomplishing the same idea as what we have been discussing.,47,,
232,0.97,1393.725,1413.211,I don't have any opposition to sort of the quick turn around of introducing today and putting it in committee and just wanted to Vouch for that process as I think being in accordance with the discussion and the notice that people have had on this particular issue.,47,,
233,0.97,1413.211,1414.045,Thank you.,48,,

757,0.97,4041.504,4048.177,"Item one on the agenda, will the clerk please read item one into the record?",195,,
758,0.97,4048.177,4057.42,"The report of the community and economic development Committee, agenda item number one current Council bill 120000.",196,,
759,0.97,4057.42,4070.833,"And ordinance relating to the organization of the office of civil rights, amending section 3.1 4.910 of the Seattle municipal code to change the end of the directors term and remove an outdated subsection requiring a Rasul equity Toolkit.",196,,
760,0.97,4070.833,4072.835,The committee recommends the bill pass.,196,,
761,0.97,4072.835,4075.905,Thank you so much.,197,,
762,0.97,4075.905,4079.141,"Councilmember Morales, you're recognized in order to provide the report.",197,,
763,0.97,4079.141,4081.143,"Thank you, colleagues.",198,,
764,0.97,4081.143,4089.718,"So, this is a bill that would, as the clerk mentioned, extend the term of the office of civil rights director.",198,,
765,0.97,4089.718,4096.659,"From December of 2021, to December of 2022.",198,,
766,0.97,4096.659,4116.946,"Just by way of a little bit of background to try to give you some context here, in 2017, Councilmembers heard a variety of concerns from Stakeholders that the office of civil rights structure and authority within the executive branch could possibly limit its ability for the Department to fulfill its mission.",198,,
767,0.97,4116.946,4130.759,"So, the Council at that time acted and ordinance that provided that the next office of civil rights director would be confirmed by Council with just cause removal protections.",198,,
768,0.97,4130.759,4133.462,And a limited term that would end in 2021.,198,,
769,0.97,4133.462,4143.105,"So, reason for this extension is kind of two fold some of that work is still continuing.",198,,
770,0.97,4143.105,4150.412,There is an interest in that transition that would be implemented by that legislation having a consistent director.,198,,
771,0.97,4150.412,4156.986,"Stable director, leadership position for the next year until that work is complete.",198,,
772,0.97,4156.986,4172.935,"The second reason is that extending the term is one of the measures that could provide greater independence, and by which I mean it would allow for the directorship to have staggered terms with the appointing authority.",198,,
773,0.97,4172.935,4181.143,"So, that's two of the reasons why this extension for one year is being requested.",198,,
774,0.97,4181.143,4188.851,"The intent here is not to continue to extend the directorship, but to just extend for this one year.",198,,
775,0.97,4188.851,4197.76,I also want to take a minute just to express my strong support for the implementation of racial equity Toolkit recommendations that came out of this work.,198,,
776,0.97,4197.76,4204.466,"As a former human rights Commissioner, I participated in an extensive process that culminated in that support.",198,,
777,0.97,4204.466,4214.043,"It did include input from community members, from workers, from other human rights Commission is at the time.",198,,
778,0.97,4214.043,4219.949,"So, I'm eager for that work to complete it.",198,,
779,0.97,4219.949,4234.997,"I do want to thank Councilmember Herbold for bringing forth the original in 2017 to examine how we can strengthen office of civil rights . As clerk mentioned, this was passed out of Commission with a recommendation that it do fast.",198,,
780,0.97,4234.997,4238.2,"Thank you, Councilmember Morales.",199,,
781,0.97,4238.2,4243.872,Are there any comments from Councilmembers on this bill?,199,,
782,0.97,4243.872,4246.308,Councilmember Sawant?,199,,
783,0.97,4246.308,4248.978,I see your hand up.,199,,
784,0.97,4248.978,4250.412,"Oh, that might be a holdover.",199,,
785,0.97,4250.412,4253.682,Looks like it was a holdover.,199,,
786,0.97,4253.682,4263.926,"So, yes, Councilmember Morales, thank you for recognizing the author of the slide that led to the work.",199,,
787,0.97,4263.926,4277.206,"Recommendations from, led by SSC are, and delivered to the Council I think in late 2019.",199,,
788,0.97,4277.206,4280.042,I was also the sponsor of the legislation that we are amending today.,199,,
789,0.97,4280.042,4301.13,"Just mentioning that, just to let my colleagues know that as the sponsor of that legislation that created a term, and created a requirement for a just cause reason for determination, that I do in fact support this legislation.",199,,
790,0.97,4301.13,4308.504,"With that, if there are no further comments, will the clerk please call the roll on the passage of the bill?",199,,
791,0.97,4327.489,4331.994,"Seven in favor, none opposed.",200,,

800,0.97,4362.691,4370.432,"Councilmember Morales, as the committee chair, I hand it over to you to introduce the item.",204,,
801,0.97,4370.432,4374.737,Thank you.,205,,
802,0.97,4374.737,4383.045,"Well, first I want to begin by thanking you, Councilmember Herbold, for continuing this work and allowing me to cosponsor the legislation.",205,,
803,0.97,4383.045,4385.848,"Prior to the pandemic, commercial tenants had nearly no protections in the city.",205,,
804,0.97,4385.848,4387.583,They don't have a just cause Eviction ordinance.,205,,
805,0.97,4387.583,4394.556,And had been left mostly defend for themselves while these diffuse arise.,205,,
806,0.97,4394.556,4403.365,"Simultaneously, small business tenants have provided a lot to our communities as we are dealing with this pandemic especially.",205,,
807,0.97,4403.365,4410.472,"There have been spaces for conversation, classes for cultural exchange.",205,,
808,0.97,4410.472,4418.38,"Even provide some public safety, just through the simple fact of business owners and staff being aware of what's happening, and frankly just being from our neighborhoods.",205,,
809,0.97,4418.38,4429.358,"They understand the neighborhood . Also, integral to our communities and the pandemic has taken a toll on them as we all know.",205,,
810,0.97,4429.358,4438.2,"So, this legislation is necessary because while some landlords are operating in good faith, and collaborating with the tenants as we heard them this morning.",205,,
811,0.97,4438.2,4443.372,Others are using a small loophole to push people out.,205,,
812,0.97,4443.372,4455.317,"While this is a technical amendment, it serves as a reminder that these emergency protections are Nonnegotiable, and that commercial tenants will need these protections well beyond the end of the pandemic.",205,,
813,0.97,4455.317,4458.62,Our city is already experiencing disaster Gentrification every week.,205,,
814,0.97,4458.62,4467.329,I hear in my district about another nonprofit storefront space that is having to shut down.,205,,
815,0.97,4467.329,4469.131,Because they cannot afford to pay the rent anymore.,205,,
816,0.97,4469.131,4471.8,They are being pushed out.,205,,
817,0.97,4471.8,4480.943,We are losing longtime small businesses and these are our neighborhood anchors.,205,,
818,0.97,4480.943,4487.85,"So, we don't want to have to worry about national chains moving in and replacing these real Community-Based entities.",205,,
819,0.97,4487.85,4493.555,"So, we have to do everything we can to save them now.",205,,
820,0.97,4493.555,4501.463,"This legislation keeps businesses in place, and continues to lay the groundwork for what I hope can be a suite of permanent commercial tenant protections in the near future.",205,,
821,0.97,4501.463,4506.335,"I'll hand it back to you, interim, interim chair.",205,,
822,0.97,4506.335,4508.77,Councilmember Herbold.,205,,
823,0.97,4508.77,4510.772,"That works, thank you so much.",206,,
824,0.97,4510.772,4511.974,Councilmember Lewis.,206,,

826,0.97,4517.88,4523.185,I'm really proud to follow the leadership of yourself and Councilmember Morales in Cosponsoring this really important piece of legislation.,207,,
827,0.97,4523.185,4530.492,Our small business districts have really been through a storm throughout this pandemic.,207,,
828,0.97,4530.492,4536.999,Really unprecedented pressures that none of them do with they signed their leases that they were going to experience.,207,,
829,0.97,4536.999,4539.668,That they knew that they were going to have to be prepared for.,207,,
830,0.97,4539.668,4552.814,"That's why last year, working with a previous member of my staff, Catherine Sims, put together legislation on personal guarantee leases, and their suspension during this time period.",207,,
831,0.97,4552.814,4559.788,I think this policy around commercial tendencies is also really critically important.,207,,
832,0.97,4559.788,4570.432,Anything that we can do from a regulatory standpoint to stem the bleeding that our small district--small business districts are facing right now and into the future is time well spent.,207,,
833,0.97,4570.432,4576.638,This is their lifeblood of our economy and our community.,207,,
834,0.97,4576.638,4583.745,"It has just been really sad to see that despite our efforts, a lot of our neighbors, and a lot of our neighborhood small businesses are not coming back.",207,,
835,0.97,4583.745,4587.349,At the end of this.,207,,
836,0.97,4587.349,4592.854,"So, anything we can do to make sure that more folks get to the end, that we can still go to our favorite neighborhood restaurant.",207,,
837,0.97,4592.854,4596.925,That we can still patronize our favorite neighborhood bookstore.,207,,
838,0.97,4596.925,4617.879,"Is a measure that gets us closer to that, and coming out of this on the other side so we can rebuild together and make sure these businesses that are really cultural institutions in some cases in our neighborhoods, are still with us after we get through this public health crisis that has rocked so many small business owners.",207,,
839,0.97,4617.879,4623.051,"So, looking forward to voting on this today and really appreciate the leadership of yourself and Councilmember Morales in bringing this forward.",207,,

843,0.97,4629.191,4635.897,"I did speak to this item at length in Committee, I'm sorry in briefings this morning.",208,,
844,0.97,4635.897,4644.072,It strengthens our existing protections that the council passed for small businesses and Nonprofits through the end of the declared civil emergency.,208,,
845,0.97,4644.072,4651.38,"It protects against threat increases, and requires reasonable payment plans to address arrears.",208,,
846,0.97,4651.38,4670.832,"With a possible end of the moratorium looming June 30th, it could not be more important that Seattle's beloved small business owners and a central Nonprofits have every opportunity to come to the table with their landlords for any pandemic related arrears.",208,,

864,0.97,4804.933,4811.64,"As mentioned this morning, I am bringing an amendment to this bill which was posted with the agenda.",213,,
865,0.97,4811.64,4829.09,"So, what I will do first is I will move to amend Council bill--let's see--Council bill 120065 as presented on them then meant one of the agenda.",213,,

871,0.97,4839.901,4846.975,"So, the amendment itself alters the bill as introduced, and as Eard in committee.",215,,
872,0.97,4846.975,4865.627,"Again, the bill as heard in committee moves both the PEO's and the 911 dispatch out of the Seattle police Department and moves both into the new community safety and communications center.",215,,
873,0.97,4865.627,4890.252,"This amendment will ensure that we are only moving the 911 dispatch out of the police Department, and into the community safety and communications center, and we are maintaining the PEO's in SPD until a later date.",215,,
874,0.97,4890.252,4898.56,I believe we are looking at bringing this up again sometime before September.,215,,
875,0.97,4898.56,4905.267,"So, with that, can I--I will move amendment one.",215,,
876,0.97,4905.267,4909.07,If I could get a second to amendment one?,215,,
877,0.97,4909.07,4910.672,Second.,216,,

886,0.97,4943.872,4951.146,"But, I think that this is a smart move for now, and I know there will be more conversations.",221,,

888,0.97,4959.354,4969.631,"Members of the public as well as we all remain committed to the goals that we talked about last year and those details, working out those details is really going to matter in the next few months here.",221,,

896,0.97,4989.751,4994.923,I am hoping to have additional conversations with folks.,223,,
897,0.97,4994.923,5024.285,"I think last week Councilmember Lewis indicated some real discomfort with trying to walk the line between--or, really get between two different unions in the city . I think it's really important that we have a clear understanding from the different perspectives of our city employees, why they think one is preferred over the other.",223,,
898,0.97,5024.285,5034.863,"I have not been able to have those conversations yet, and so I appreciate the opportunity to move forward with the 911 call response.",223,,
899,0.97,5034.863,5046.875,"To get my questions answered, a little more time to get my questions answered about how the parking enforcement side of this equation.",223,,

903,0.97,5052.68,5057.619,"Thank you, Madam President pro Tem.",225,,
904,0.97,5057.619,5071.366,"I made my comments this morning during briefing, but I think for the record, for the afternoon meeting, I should just briefly mention as well, similar to the sentiment Councilmember Mireles expressed.",225,,
905,0.97,5071.366,5079.741,I think it is always hard for us as a progressive Prolabor Council when two members of our broader labor family have different views on a policy.,225,,
906,0.97,5079.741,5081.643,Although I would say a common interest.,225,,
907,0.97,5081.643,5087.449,There is unanimity that we want to move this work function out of SPD.,225,,
908,0.97,5087.449,5090.919,There is some dispute on exactly where we are going to send them.,225,,
909,0.97,5090.919,5103.531,I do think that this would benefit from some additional time where we can use our relationships and our appreciation service for both unions.,225,,
910,0.97,5103.531,5109.838,To better understand a way to resolve this and equitably and in a way that doesn't divide the labor movement.,225,,
911,0.97,5109.838,5120.381,I do appreciate this approach and I think that this time between now and the fall will be productive in resolving this in a good way.,225,,
912,0.97,5120.381,5121.182,Thank you so much.,225,,
913,0.97,5121.182,5122.283,"Thank you, Councilmember Lewis.",226,,
914,0.97,5122.283,5135.797,I want to just take a moment to express my sincere appreciation for the efforts of PEO's to engage with this Council.,226,,
915,0.97,5135.797,5148.576,"Both back in September through November, and sort of the development of their worker led mission for how they can play a role in Reimagining public safety in the city.",226,,
916,0.97,5148.576,5157.318,"As well, their continued engagement even today as we consider this legislation.",226,,
917,0.97,5157.318,5168.897,Look forward to ongoing conversations moving forward to see if we can reach some agreement on these really important policy issues.,226,,
918,0.97,5168.897,5172.6,"With that, not seeing any further questions.",226,,

925,0.97,5186.748,5189.05,Yes.,232,,

929,0.97,5192.053,5193.655,Yes.,236,,

933,0.97,5198.159,5200.361,Yes.,240,,

935,0.97,5203.064,5206.968,"The motion carries, the amendment is adopted and the amended bill is now before the Council.",242,,
936,0.97,5206.968,5212.574,Are there any further questions or comments?,242,,
937,0.97,5212.574,5218.046,Councilmember Juarez.,242,,
938,0.97,5218.046,5231.693,"Thank you, president pro Tem Herbold, I will be voting yes on this bill but I just wanted to be making some comments about where I feel things are.",243,,
939,0.97,5231.693,5237.899,The Seattle police Department's roles to the new community safety and communications center.,243,,
940,0.97,5237.899,5256.484,"In the passed, Seattle's political establishment have presented that this is the demand for the justice for George Floyd movement and Conflated it . In reality, this is overwhelmingly an accounting mechanism.",243,,
941,0.97,5256.484,5265.126,"As I said, I support this, but I think we need to be accurate in characterizing what it is.",243,,
942,0.97,5265.126,5271.132,With parking enforcement there is zero change in the function.,243,,
943,0.97,5271.132,5284.912,Some community members hope that this is the first step to creating a community safety structure where police are not always dispatched when there is situations like mental health emergencies.,243,,
944,0.97,5284.912,5289.35,"However, that continues to be an aspiration for the future.",243,,
945,0.97,5289.35,5292.453,This bill that the Council is voting on today only changes the accounting lines.,243,,
946,0.97,5292.453,5301.963,"As I said, I will continue to support this bill, but I do not agree with the on goings attempts to Conflate it with Defunding the police.",243,,
947,0.97,5301.963,5307.869,There is a danger when it is described as something akin to the demands that black lives matter movement brought forward last year.,243,,
948,0.97,5307.869,5312.94,The right-wing pretends that the police do not have the money to fight crime.,243,,
949,0.97,5312.94,5320.481,"When in reality, these accounting changes offer nothing about the number of police officers in Seattle.",243,,
950,0.97,5320.481,5322.35,The amount of policing in Seattle.,243,,
951,0.97,5322.35,5329.123,The only change is in the name of the Department signing the paychecks for the sub departments.,243,,
952,0.97,5329.123,5341.002,"I'm concerned that the Mayor may try to increase the police budget for 2022, claiming she's only returning it to its normal level, when in reality that would be a massive expansion of the police budget.",243,,
953,0.97,5341.002,5348.509,"These accounting tricks have moved major expenses off, formally moved them off the SPD books.",243,,
954,0.97,5348.509,5356.718,"I will vote yes on this recession, but I urge black lives matter list to remain vigilant.",243,,
955,0.97,5356.718,5358.186,Thank you.,243,,
956,0.97,5358.186,5365.927,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant.",244,,
957,0.97,5365.927,5368.83,"I'm not sure if Councilmember Lews, you have your hand up again?",244,,
958,0.97,5368.83,5372.834,"Yes, Madam President pro Tem.",245,,
959,0.97,5372.834,5388.916,"I did just want to comment and say while I appreciate Councilmember Sawant's characterization that this is going to change how these employees are paid, there are more significant structural changes that come with the transfer under this provision.",245,,
960,0.97,5388.916,5399.26,"The 911 Dispatchers will now be under civilian command and control, and a new Department that has an interim director in the new communications civilian Department.",245,,
961,0.97,5399.26,5411.272,I do want to take advantage of this opportunity to maybe just foreshadow Madam President pro Tem the work that our offices have been doing in collaboration with providers.,245,,
962,0.97,5411.272,5414.675,With the defender Association.,245,,
963,0.97,5414.675,5424.886,And with other jurisdictions within cities throughout the different process that you discussed during your comments at Council briefing this morning.,245,,
964,0.97,5424.886,5440.301,That those conversations have new life into them in terms of the responsibility of the Dispatchers being under civilian command and control.,245,,
965,0.97,5440.301,5447.608,No longer being under the control of a sworn police captain which was the previous arrangement that we are ending with this boat today.,245,,
966,0.97,5447.608,5470.131,"So, I did just want to indicate that while it is the case that a lot of it is a technical and accounting administrative change, there are some real considerable changes in terms of who the dispatch is accountable to, and what the incentives of that bureaucracy are, and what the policy remedies can be on the future of how we do dispatch by the change we are making today.",245,,
967,0.97,5470.131,5481.542,That does represent a very structural shift in our ability to Recalibrate and Re-Hook up our dispatch apparatus to things that are not police response systems.,245,,
968,0.97,5481.542,5488.082,"We are taking that first step today, and look forward to continuing that work over the course of this year.",245,,
969,0.97,5488.082,5493.321,"Thank you so much, Councilmember Lewis.",246,,
970,0.97,5493.321,5498.559,Any other comments on the bill?,246,,
971,0.97,5498.559,5506.534,Before we request the--calling of the role?,246,,
972,0.97,5506.534,5515.076,I am not seeing any requests for comment or questions.,246,,
973,0.97,5515.076,5518.946,"So, with that, will the clerk please call the roll on the passage of the amended bill?",246,,
974,0.97,5518.946,5535.496,"Seven in favor, none opposed.",247,,
975,0.97,5535.496,5540.601,Thank you so much.,248,,
976,0.97,5540.601,5542.67,"The bill passes as amended, and the chair will sign it.",248,,
977,0.97,5542.67,5546.908,With the clerk these affects my signature to the legislation on my behalf?,248,,
978,0.97,5546.908,5549.577,Thank you so much.,249,,
979,0.97,5549.577,5563.991,"Item number 13, we moved up from the amended agenda so that we can hear item number 13 directly following the related item that we just voted on.",249,,
980,0.97,5563.991,5564.825,Item number three.,249,,
981,0.97,5564.825,5569.564,"Clerk, will you please read the item 13 into the record?",249,,

986,0.97,5589.55,5597.959,I move to pass Council bill 120078.,251,,

988,0.97,5599.26,5603.431,Second.,252,,
989,0.97,5603.431,5607.668,"Thank you, it's been moved and Seconded to pass the bill.",253,,
990,0.97,5607.668,5612.173,As sponsor of the Adam I will real quickly explain what it is and open the floor in case there are additional comments.,253,,
991,0.97,5612.173,5635.262,"As mentioned previously, part of the Council action during the fall budget deliberations were to include a proviso in the legislation that directed the executive to move 911 dispatch and the PEO's into the new community safety and communications center.",253,,
992,0.97,5635.262,5640.701,The proviso was a date by which we expected the move to ocher.,253,,
993,0.97,5640.701,5681.409,"The impact of not authorizing the move by that time is simply that the folks in those two given that we don't have agreement around the moving of the PEO's from SPD to the community safety and communications center, by the deadline that we imposed for the executive, we now don't ourselves have an ability to move that forward just now without additional conversation.",253,,
994,0.97,5681.409,5688.749,It's really important that we extend the proviso until September in order for the PEO unit to be paid.,253,,
995,0.97,5688.749,5695.222,"With that, are there any additional comments or questions?",253,,
996,0.97,5695.222,5697.458,About this item?,253,,

1083,0.97,6223.35,6237.364,This is an infrared Video camera that is mounted on an airplane or helicopter and it can zoom into show details on the ground in terrifying detail.,279,,
1084,0.97,6237.364,6247.708,It is technology that was developed by contractors digging in the 1950s on behalf of the U.S. military.,279,,
1085,0.97,6247.708,6258.518,"The surveillance impact reports analyze the hypothetical ways that a technology could be used Productively, or could be used to infringe on civil liberties and that hypothetical analysis is important.",279,,
1086,0.97,6258.518,6261.321,In this case we have clear experience showing how this technology is actually used.,279,,
1087,0.97,6261.321,6277.638,One defense attorney fought for and eventually received the public records that exposed how the Washington State patrol used this infrared Video technology to continuously monitor and spy on the black lives matter movement in Seattle last summer.,279,,

1107,0.97,6413.073,6421.782,I want to be clear that there are socially responsible users of Forward-Looking infrared real-time Video.,279,,
1108,0.97,6421.782,6426.486,It is useful for example for tracking Wildfires and for finding people lost in the wilderness.,279,,

1112,0.97,6443.136,6451.478,"It is also sometimes used to track fleeing suspects, but it has a mass negative impact on progressive protests.",279,,
1113,0.97,6451.478,6456.516,"So, on balance, the effect is negative.",279,,

1117,0.97,6468.528,6471.331,Because of the high resolution thermal imaging the camera captures a lot of detail.,279,,
1118,0.97,6471.331,6487.214,"In one Video, which is linked on the Capitol Hill Seattle Blog, article, the plane's camera Hones in on one group of onlookers who are observing the protest, and the police reaction from on Capitol building roof.",279,,
1119,0.97,6487.214,6489.649,The police were looking for someone who allegedly threw a rock.,279,,

1130,0.97,6568.228,6586.546,"It is outrageous that Councilmembers who spoke instantly about opposing a Militarized police response are now considering giving permission to the SPD to continue using the data from this by technology against ordinary people who are newly exercising their first amendment protest sorry, rights.",279,,

1135,0.97,6607.867,6609.069,From the public comment responses.,279,,
1136,0.97,6609.069,6621.881,That this will be used against black people and protesters but it's expensive and that money is better used to feed and House people in our city.,279,,
1137,0.97,6621.881,6626.019,This is a creepy tool to put in the hands of people who have already proven they cannot be trusted.,279,,
1138,0.97,6626.019,6628.388,We shouldn't be a surveillance state.,279,,
1139,0.97,6628.388,6631.992,Our police should not be able to monitor us from the air with technology that can see us.,279,,

1144,0.97,6659.185,6665.725,Spd has already used tools at their disposal to Brutalize people.,279,,
1145,0.97,6665.725,6675.502,Why does the Seattle police Department feel they need--feel the need to use military surveillance equipment on its domestic population?,279,,
1146,0.97,6675.502,6682.008,"The last comment I'll read is no matter what you say in response to public comment, we know you're just using this to help oppress citizens and protesters.",279,,

1153,0.97,6704.23,6707.767,I do have a few questions.,281,,

1155,0.97,6711.071,6718.978,"I know President pro Tem that's not the desired place to do this, but obviously I'm concerned about the report that Councilmember Sawant just Referenced.",281,,
1156,0.97,6718.978,6725.885,I will also note that my team and I did ask central staff quite a few questions about this technology.,281,,
1157,0.97,6725.885,6728.688,That is a concern of mine as well.,281,,
1158,0.97,6728.688,6732.158,I did remember some of the reports of incident.,281,,
1159,0.97,6732.158,6759.185,"I know we don't typically have central staff on these calls, so for the sake of Maybe the sponsor and Councilmember Sawant who RAISES the questions, I'll just point out that when I asked about the detailed images that this device, which I believe is currently used, will project, what I understood from the answers is that the way this camera works is people don't show up.",281,,
1160,0.97,6759.185,6765.492,"It's actually just red Blobs, Úand there's no defining images so, I'm really concerned about the state technology that was used.",281,,
1161,0.97,6765.492,6776.636,"I'm obviously in alignment with the concerns that were used from that state technology, especially as it relates to last year's surveillance of protesters and the consequences of that.",281,,
1162,0.97,6776.636,6779.706,Want to continue to fight against that type of technology.,281,,
1163,0.97,6779.706,6788.648,"I do want to have a better understanding though about this specific technology, and if it's slightly different, if it truly is just Blobs, versus defining or definitive images.",281,,
1164,0.97,6788.648,6804.264,"I would be very concerned, and I continue to be skeptical about this technology in general, but obviously in opposition to anything that would be defining for the purposes of future arrests or targeting of folks.",281,,
1165,0.97,6804.264,6811.971,"So, I wanted to get that out there because I thought I had done some research on this, and had heard that it was no defining images, and simply great big Blobs.",281,,
1166,0.97,6811.971,6816.476,Councilmember Pedersen.,282,,
1167,0.97,6816.476,6819.145,"Councilmember Mosqueda, you are correct.",283,,
1168,0.97,6819.145,6830.69,Your research with central staff is sound and that is the reference to an airplane was not the same technology as the King County sheriff's technology that we are voting on today.,283,,
1169,0.97,6830.69,6836.162,It's a different technology where it's just thermal imaging where it doesn't show the details.,283,,
1170,0.97,6836.162,6841.668,That's what we are voting on today.,283,,
1171,0.97,6841.668,6843.87,"So, central staff gave you the correct information.",283,,
1172,0.97,6843.87,6848.174,May I ask a follow-up question?,284,,
1173,0.97,6848.174,6849.442,"Absolutely, go ahead.",285,,
1174,0.97,6849.442,6862.589,Is there any sort of sideboard that are or could be put on the use of the technology so that it is not used in situations like hovering over expressions of first amendment rights?,286,,
1175,0.97,6862.589,6870.296,"I mean, I was understanding that this was more for a search function, and I'm not sure what the extent of that search function is.",286,,
1176,0.97,6870.296,6877.437,That feels very different than a hovering over first amendment right demonstrations.,286,,
1177,0.97,6877.437,6881.741,Is there any sort of sideboards that we have currently that we could .22 how it can be used?,286,,
1178,0.97,6881.741,6885.044,That is part of the amendment that was passed in committee.,287,,
1179,0.97,6885.044,6896.256,We recognized that one of the things that they are required to include in any policies is a definition of the purpose and use.,287,,
1180,0.97,6896.256,6910.937,Including circumstances where officers may request assistance from the county for these Forward-Looking infrared Real- time Video content.,287,,
1181,0.97,6910.937,6925.752,One of the amendments that passed in committee was a recognition that that was something that was missing and that we need to receive as a definition of the purpose and use.,287,,
1182,0.97,6925.752,6932.458,Even given that this is technology that is already being used.,287,,
1183,0.97,6932.458,6940.8,"The counselor, or the committee, thought it was really important to get those sideboards in.",287,,
1184,0.97,6940.8,6946.472,Thank you very much for letting me use sometime during full Council to ask this question.,288,,
1185,0.97,6946.472,6956.215,"I also understand Councilmember Herbold, along with Councilmember Pedersen, you offered a series of amendments to address a number of questions I know I had.",288,,
1186,0.97,6956.215,6959.385,I was told by central staff that some of those have been addressed.,288,,
1187,0.97,6959.385,6964.324,I really appreciate the reminder on where those can be used.,288,,
1188,0.97,6964.324,6968.428,I will continue to express concern about the state technology.,288,,
1189,0.97,6968.428,6983.242,"Anything that would be Honing in on anybody's ability to have identifying information, and perhaps I'll do a follow-up with the chair of public safety just to kind of make sure that we are continuing to monitor to make sure that isn't being used inappropriately.",288,,
1190,0.97,6983.242,6989.749,"Even though we tried to put some sideboards on that baby before, we know there's been some ignoring of those rules and want to make sure that that's not the case with this.",288,,
1191,0.97,6989.749,6993.92,"So that it truly remains Non- identifiable, and not used for first amendment expression surveillance.",288,,
1192,0.97,6993.92,6995.822,Thank you.,289,,
1193,0.97,6995.822,7005.531,"I just want to also just very quickly, want to highlight the additional amendments in case there are questions that Councilmembers might have.",289,,
1194,0.97,7005.531,7024.784,Amendments included recognizing that we need to receive from SPD policies that specifically define the Timeline for Deletion of images to protect the privacy of individuals not connected to any investigation.,289,,
1195,0.97,7024.784,7035.595,Policies that specifically describe how they are going to ensure that this technology is not used in a way to Disproportionally Surveil communities.,289,,
1196,0.97,7035.595,7046.806,"Lastly, an amendment that requires an annual report of the use of this technology and helicopter deployment.",289,,
1197,0.97,7046.806,7056.516,These are all areas that have been flagged for the committee by the technology working group.,289,,
1198,0.97,7056.516,7061.22,"Councilmember Sawant, you had your hand up.",289,,
1199,0.97,7061.22,7063.89,Is that a hold over or do you want to speak again?,289,,
1200,0.97,7063.89,7065.625,I would like to speak again.,290,,
1201,0.97,7065.625,7067.527,Thank you.,290,,
1202,0.97,7067.527,7078.504,I think it is important for Councilmembers who are asking these questions to look at the Video themselves and see how defining the images are.,290,,
1203,0.97,7078.504,7085.011,"Once you zoom in, it is stunning how much clarity there is.",290,,
1204,0.97,7085.011,7103.663,"If Councilmembers are maintaining that this is different technology, as Councilmember Pedersen has had, you should hold off on this bill and show the Video to the Council and the members of the public at the committee meeting that is announced well in advance of members of the public can judge for themselves whether or not this is a violation of their rights.",290,,
1205,0.97,7103.663,7116.476,"Just to clarify, the amendment in Committee, obviously I'm not a member of the committee, but the amendment that was mentioned by Councilmember Herbold.",290,,
1206,0.97,7116.476,7129.689,What it does is essentially it says that approve this bill now and say that the problem--that there is really nothing essentially to protect civil liberties.,290,,
1207,0.97,7129.689,7134.393,"That is a problem we have to acknowledge that the problem exists, but it doesn't stop approval of the legislation.",290,,
1208,0.97,7134.393,7138.998,I don't understand it how we as a legislation body can do this.,290,,
1209,0.97,7138.998,7165.024,"If we know this and we know how the technology can be used because we've seen it, we have seen the absolutely abysmal track record of a police Department that as I quoted in briefing just a week or two ago, that in a study of 500 different police departments, comes very, very close to the end in terms of accountability and racial bias and so on and so forth.",290,,
1210,0.97,7165.024,7169.929,How it is that Councilmembers can justify giving this police Department this technology.,290,,
1211,0.97,7169.929,7180.439,"To be very accurate, to be very specific, Seattle police Department ranked 477Th out of 500 police departments that were studied.",290,,
1212,0.97,7180.439,7190.016,"So, it's not like it's some problems, this Departmnt is very much the epitome of things not working well in a police Department.",290,,
1213,0.97,7190.016,7206.232,"So, if Councilmembers are concerned about the potential violation of civil rights by the SPD, then you should vote no on this bill today and let the committee hold hearings on the Forward-Looking infrared real-time Video technology so that we can have transparency and public accountability.",290,,

1254,0.97,7361.42,7366.325,Especially as it relates to concerns that are being raised around surveillance of first amendment rights.,312,,

1263,0.97,7414.473,7419.779,It's just the equity Metrics that are being used to report back to us on those.,313,,
1264,0.97,7419.779,7435.561,"I think it's more important for me to mention as part of this underlying surveillance ordinance, one of the requirements with all SPD Technologies is that the office of Inspector General continues to monitor and report on these for us.",313,,

1268,0.97,7459.518,7468.427,This is an item that the technology Workgroup identified as a priority gap.,314,,

1294,0.97,7649.675,7660.619,"Councilmember Pedersen, as chair of the committee, perhaps this is for you or the President pro Tem as chair of safety.",323,,
1295,0.97,7660.619,7664.323,Did I understand correctly that this is an existing technology that we are now approving?,323,,
1296,0.97,7664.323,7668.394,How come SPD had approval to use it prior to today's authorization?,323,,
1297,0.97,7668.394,7670.429,That is the nature of the beast.,324,,
1298,0.97,7670.429,7674.433,Councilmember Pedersen?,324,,
1299,0.97,7674.433,7688.914,"The surveillance ordinance that was originally adopted in 2017, and then refined by Council President Gonzalez in 2018, and others, this is the process where it goes, first goes through the surveillance working group.",325,,
1300,0.97,7688.914,7691.35,The volunteer surveillance working group.,325,,
1301,0.97,7691.35,7693.752,The department puts together a work.,325,,
1302,0.97,7693.752,7707.766,"It is reviewed by the information technology Department to scope out what the technology does, and what the concerns, whether it is surveillance, has surveillance capabilities, what the concerns and Litigants might be.",325,,
1303,0.97,7707.766,7710.869,And it works its way through this process to get to us.,325,,
1304,0.97,7710.869,7719.278,"Then, the office of Inspector General continues to monitor this going forward.",325,,
1305,0.97,7719.278,7732.958,That is the case for all of the technology that all of the departments currently use at the time of the passage of the surveillance ordinance.,326,,
1306,0.97,7732.958,7743.502,"So, when we talk about the retrospective technologies, we are talking about surveillance Technologies that were purchased before the passage of the surveillance ordinance.",326,,
1307,0.97,7743.502,7755.114,"Our expectation is that, correct me if I'm wrong Councilmember Pedersen, is that there are no future purchases of surveillance technology moving forward.",326,,
1308,0.97,7755.114,7764.89,Because we want to--the expectation is that we will pass these kinds of policies as a requirement to permit the purchase.,326,,
1309,0.97,7764.89,7769.695,"But, we don't have that opportunity for things that were already purchased.",326,,

1312,0.97,7777.436,7785.144,"Just because the Department is using it, doesn't necessarily mean we have to authorize it.",328,,
1313,0.97,7785.144,7787.813,You've gone through the rigorous process in committee of evaluating the barely U.S.,328,,

1315,0.97,7789.314,7802.027,Or you have added the appropriate sideboards to make it aligned with the Council's priorities and thus it's not just a symptom of it being currently used.,328,,
