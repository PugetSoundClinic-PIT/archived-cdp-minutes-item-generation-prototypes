57,0.97,288.554,301.167,"Our stake holders include all who work, live and do business in Pioneer square.",11,,
58,0.97,301.167,311.544,The pandemic caused some shelters in our neighborhood to close leaving many individuals who would seek services in these shelters to survive on our streets.,11,,
59,0.97,311.544,320.086,Before Pausing intake of new clients the program was Impactful on this issue and directly addressed the neighbor's needs through a targeted outreach effort.,11,,
60,0.97,320.086,328.494,Pioneer square community members have repeatedly expressed that the just care program impacts clear and visible.,11,,
61,0.97,328.494,338.438,"Neighborhood leaders including business owners, property owners, residents, as well as the Alliance for Pioneer square want action and impact.",11,,
62,0.97,338.438,350.516,We support that impact but the just care model and offer of lodging and support rather than enforcement in all occasions where that can be effective.,11,,
63,0.97,350.516,353.353,Just care through a functional framework.,11,,
64,0.97,353.353,364.831,The alliance of Pioneer square and our organizations and the Chinatown International district are responsible for asking for reasonable measures to address the challenges in our neighborhoods.,11,,

73,0.97,390.089,392.558,I am the just cares project coordinator.,13,,
74,0.97,392.558,396.896,Just cares has been changing lives and breaking a perpetual cycle of addiction.,13,,
75,0.97,396.896,407.473,Each day you will find me in Encampments where society is much rather ignoring our problem.,13,,
76,0.97,407.473,411.244,"I'm going in building trust, I've lived experience and I've got the resources.",13,,
77,0.97,411.244,414.213,This is something that is almost never offered.,13,,
78,0.97,414.213,420.853,"With my knowledge of the justice system, addiction and crime I outreach someone's daughters, fathers and loved ones.",13,,
79,0.97,420.853,426.058,They have survived outside through trauma and loss only to become part of a never ending cycle of homelessness.,13,,
80,0.97,426.058,430.196,As I build trust with my clients I respond to the neighborhood issues and concerns.,13,,
81,0.97,430.196,435.268,As our clients move inside we wrap services around them with neighborhood care and outreach.,13,,
82,0.97,435.268,440.673,I work with the most vulnerable mentally ill and chronically homeless.,13,,
83,0.97,440.673,444.644,This is what we are talking about throwing back on to the streets on March 15th.,13,,
84,0.97,444.644,447.48,I have a client who many of you know from Pioneer square.,13,,
85,0.97,447.48,452.852,"Many say the only thing that was left for her was jail, institutions and death.",13,,
86,0.97,452.852,462.628,"She would have multiple calls a week from the community to SPD and 911 for mental health crisis, not wearing clothing and unsafe behavior.",13,,
87,0.97,462.628,468.701,We brought her into our program and are treating mental health and extensive trauma from years of homelessness.,13,,
88,0.97,468.701,485.918,If we put her back on the streets she will most likely return to pioneer square where she will return to her Abusers until she is used to the point where she mentally breaks again and is screaming in the streets naked where 911 will be called and the response cycle will continue.,13,,
89,0.97,485.918,487.72,"Jailed, institutions and eventually death.",13,,
90,0.97,487.72,494.26,There are 125 of these stories each different and each as powerful that will be forced back out on to our street.,13,,
91,0.97,494.26,501.4,Seattle city Council has the ability to break Seattle's historical homeless cycle.,13,,
92,0.97,501.4,502.368,We have been successful.,13,,

99,0.97,527.56,530.229,Thank you for allowing me to speak again today.,15,,
100,0.97,530.229,533.199,I am speaking on behalf of the just care program with PDA.,15,,
101,0.97,533.199,541.107,I represent a small hotel in downtown Seattle that as many of you know has faced tremendous challenges during the pandemic.,15,,
102,0.97,541.107,547.68,Our hotel has closed for 65 days last year and our restaurant has now closed three times throughout the past year.,15,,
103,0.97,547.68,558.324,During this pandemic we have furloughed and laid off over 50 employees who have not only been long time colleagues but many are friends.,15,,
104,0.97,558.324,565.231,As a leader in hospitality for over 17 years I have never experienced anything like what the pandemic has done to our field.,15,,
105,0.97,565.231,573.539,When PDA first approached us with this opportunity there was hesitancy on our part as this was truly a pivot from the Day- to-day hospitality business we were used to doing.,15,,
106,0.97,573.539,584.417,As we learned more about the program and the support that PDA and Aprs would provide we knew we had to answer the calling to help support the crisis happening within our city.,15,,
107,0.97,584.417,590.723,We've been in partnership for almost five months and we absolutely would make the same decision again if presented with it.,15,,
108,0.97,590.723,596.862,There has certainly been challenges but with PDA and Achs' support we've been able to work through them.,15,,
109,0.97,596.862,604.971,We've had the opportunity to bring back 20 additional staff members to help support the Day- to-day operations.,15,,
110,0.97,604.971,610.81,"As of today my team provides housing, security, meals, maintenance, housekeeping and so much more.",15,,
111,0.97,610.81,613.679,We've had a lot of success stories at the hotel too.,15,,
112,0.97,613.679,618.25,One couple was able to secure housing and will be moving out next week.,15,,
113,0.97,618.25,623.889,Another participant has bonded with our security team members and is now taking medication to help with his mental health.,15,,
114,0.97,623.889,626.559,Wins like this happen every day within our hotel.,15,,
115,0.97,626.559,632.865,Big or small it brings value and purpose to the work we are doing with Acrs.,15,,
116,0.97,632.865,637.503,If this program does not continue to be funded all of the ground we have made will be lost.,15,,
117,0.97,637.503,643.809,I come into downtown every single day and the Unhoused population continues to grow and take over our streets.,15,,
118,0.97,643.809,650.216,The crisis within our city continues to impact tourism and if not fixed it will continue to impact our potential.,15,,
119,0.97,650.216,655.154,The market is seeing an average of 6% occupancy and cannot sustain our staffing levels.,15,,
120,0.97,655.154,660.226,The likelihood of our hotel closing is very high if this program is not funded.,15,,
121,0.97,660.226,665.031,We hope you will consider funding the program through the end of the year.,15,,
122,0.97,665.031,665.398,Thank you.,15,,
123,0.97,665.398,670.436,Really appreciate you being here today and thank you for your leadership in that effort.,16,,
124,0.97,670.436,686.652,Good morning and please do correct my Pronunciation of your name.,16,,
125,0.97,686.652,693.192,Let's make sure I can see my full screen here.,16,,

134,0.97,742.241,743.776,"Hello, good morning.",16,,
135,0.97,743.776,746.078,Hi.,17,,
136,0.97,746.078,747.346,I was having issue.,17,,
137,0.97,747.346,750.249,"Hey, I'm sorry for the Pronunciation of your name.",18,,
138,0.97,750.249,752.418,It was on me for not saying that right.,18,,
139,0.97,752.418,754.653,You have your full go minutes.,18,,
140,0.97,754.653,755.321,Let's start you again.,18,,

142,0.97,757.923,758.691,Thank you.,19,,
143,0.97,758.691,759.191,Good morning.,19,,
144,0.97,759.191,760.86,I work for G Seattle club.,19,,
145,0.97,760.86,767.266,I'm the shift lead here at the just care program.,19,,
146,0.97,767.266,778.043,Our program specifically houses natives residents participants that they find in the encampment.,19,,
147,0.97,778.043,788.254,Since November we have housed 20 native clients and we have only had two positive cases of Covid during our time here.,19,,
148,0.97,788.254,788.754,Both had recovered.,19,,
149,0.97,788.754,811.243,A good thing to remember is this program is about getting folks out of the Encampments and isolating them in Noncongress Regatta shelter so they can be safe from the pandemic.,19,,
150,0.97,811.243,814.88,Many clients have started working on their personal goals.,19,,
151,0.97,814.88,819.585,A few are starting to get job interviews.,19,,
152,0.97,819.585,822.855,One accepted to Seattle film Institute.,19,,
153,0.97,822.855,828.861,We had one client give birth and she's now in the shelter.,19,,
154,0.97,828.861,838.437,Some of our other clients have been working on their mental health and getting treatment through Evergreen.,19,,
155,0.97,838.437,844.276,This program has really helped our clients in a way that most of the shelters can't.,19,,
156,0.97,844.276,852.685,Just haven't had the funding or the dedicated staff to do the things that we have done for our clients.,19,,
157,0.97,852.685,856.789,It doesn't make sense to approve more shelter.,19,,
158,0.97,856.789,866.465,Shelter surge Fund and let this current shelter with these 125 people let that go and let them return back to the street without any plan.,19,,
159,0.97,866.465,871.537,I just everyone please support this effort.,19,,
160,0.97,871.537,871.904,That's my time.,19,,

167,0.97,894.293,900.332,I am the program coordinator for one of the hotels where I work with unsheltered folks.,21,,
168,0.97,900.332,908.24,Since November we've enrolled clients into the hotel and I got to meet and build a strong relationship with each of them.,21,,
169,0.97,908.24,917.249,I see them every single day and I've witnessed the engagement level increase drastically.,21,,
170,0.97,917.249,920.686,I see motivation for substance use treatment and improvement for mental health as well.,21,,
171,0.97,920.686,925.324,Clients are job searching and getting back into the work force.,21,,
172,0.97,925.324,930.095,They're applying for Id replacements with so much barriers.,21,,
173,0.97,930.095,934.933,Some are Reconnecting with family that has been lost in this contact for years.,21,,
174,0.97,934.933,939.738,We are seeing the change and impact because of the environment they're in now.,21,,
175,0.97,939.738,944.243,Which is a temporary housing setting in hotels.,21,,
176,0.97,944.243,951.15,An environment they can feel safe and stabilize and grow as they work towards their goals.,21,,
177,0.97,951.15,956.655,How can anyone expect change in an environment where there's always SPD involved.,21,,
178,0.97,956.655,961.26,Someone getting into an ambulance.,21,,
179,0.97,961.26,963.462,Just worrying about getting survival needs met day by day.,21,,
180,0.97,963.462,970.069,With just care people are moving beyond survival and contributing back to society.,21,,
181,0.97,970.069,977.576,And many clients have told me that they would have never been able to do what they needed to do without just care.,21,,

355,0.97,1852.55,1864.462,"If you're interested in seeing a complete list of projects supported by the bond, including the Seattle center project you can find that in exhibit a to today's bill.",37,,
356,0.97,1864.462,1878.876,"Lastly before turning it over to staff, I'd just like to remind you there is one potential amendment for your consideration that is not related to the Seattle center project but is related to the repayment of Interfund loans for the West Seattle bridge.",37,,
357,0.97,1878.876,1884.649,I'm happy to describe that now or we can wait until after Seattle center's presentation.,37,,
358,0.97,1884.649,1897.595,Let's hold it and we'll get through the heart of today's initial presentation then the great catch that you and others identified as App opportunity for a possible amendment.,38,,
359,0.97,1897.595,1898.396,"Good morning, Robert and Tom.",38,,
360,0.97,1898.396,1900.531,Really appreciate you being here with us.,38,,
361,0.97,1900.531,1903.334,"I'll turn it over to you, Robert.",38,,
362,0.97,1903.334,1905.069,Looks like you're ready to go.,38,,
363,0.97,1905.069,1905.637,Thank you.,39,,
364,0.97,1905.637,1909.54,Thank you so much for allowing us to be here.,39,,
365,0.97,1909.54,1920.852,Let me share my screen and I'll bring our presentation up.,39,,
366,0.97,1920.852,1921.052,Okay.,39,,
367,0.97,1921.052,1925.156,So thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.,39,,
368,0.97,1925.156,1933.798,We are here to discuss a proposal to invest in the center Signage structure which would benefit the public.,39,,
369,0.97,1933.798,1937.168,The resident arts groups and our event clientele.,39,,
370,0.97,1937.168,1940.471,This proposal will convert approximately 150 signs into less than 50.,39,,
371,0.97,1940.471,1955.186,It will also allow us to integrate the new climate pledge arena more fully and to our campus and it's hard to understate the impact that the privately operated arena is having at the center.,39,,
372,0.97,1955.186,1966.13,"We believe this will help take advantage of that transition to improve our operations, increase revenues and provide better customer service to center visitors.",39,,
373,0.97,1966.13,1971.069,I want to note three conditions which inform our proposal.,39,,
374,0.97,1971.069,1974.706,"Our current Signage is inconsistent, outdated and in need of replacement.",39,,
375,0.97,1974.706,1986.084,"Current Signage is a mixed bag of older reader signs, sign pole banners, static map Kiosks, poster display cases and sandwich boards.",39,,
376,0.97,1986.084,1993.358,This results in a cluttered visual landscape that lacks cohesion or consistent clear Messaging.,39,,
377,0.97,1993.358,1995.259,Our visitors are poorly served.,39,,
378,0.97,1995.259,2002.8,Existing Digital reader boards are at the end of their useful life and in need of replacement.,39,,
379,0.97,2002.8,2007.472,The new Signage plan will install a comprehensive upgrade.,39,,
380,0.97,2007.472,2016.347,"The plan would consist of a new way finding, entry signs, campus and facility reader boards account art, information and Digital posters.",39,,
381,0.97,2016.347,2025.156,It will raise the level of interaction with our visitors and allow us to communicate directly to them in Realtime.,39,,
382,0.97,2025.156,2041.305,The proposal is expected to have wide reaching impacts for Seattle center and the Council approved redevelopment agreements including language comprehensive Signage program to integrate the new arena and to the Seattle center campus.,39,,
383,0.97,2041.305,2050.314,"Three, the new Signage plan will provide a new approach to an old system at Seattle center.",39,,
384,0.97,2050.314,2068.433,"It will improve visitor experience, Declutter the campus, promote campus arts and cultural institutions, provide a sustainable revenue stream to support public programs, align campus Signage and arena Signage for a consistent look and feel.",39,,
385,0.97,2068.433,2070.668,Eliminate waste associated with temporary Signage.,39,,
386,0.97,2070.668,2076.407,Allow for flexibility to communicate in multiple languages.,39,,
387,0.97,2076.407,2078.042,Allow coordinated communication during emergencies.,39,,
388,0.97,2078.042,2082.98,Maintain the center's competitive edge as a public gathering place.,39,,
389,0.97,2082.98,2087.985,Upgrade existing reader boards which are at the end of their useful life.,39,,
390,0.97,2087.985,2094.192,"Provide goodwill, community feedback has been overwhelmingly positive to these signs.",39,,
391,0.97,2094.192,2106.103,Bond financed signs will be owned and operated by the city and it will provide an integrated system for specific Campus-Wide messages to create a consistent look and feel to visitors.,39,,
392,0.97,2106.103,2113.11,Our original plan was to use incremental sponsorship revenues to pay for improvement.,39,,
393,0.97,2113.11,2121.486,Unfortunately the financial impacts of the pandemic forced us to Reprioritize our revenues.,39,,
394,0.97,2121.486,2126.19,So our proposal today is for financing.,39,,
395,0.97,2126.19,2134.398,The cost is approximately $8 million.,39,,
396,0.97,2134.398,2136.167,Funding proposed as taxable Ltgo bonds.,39,,
397,0.97,2136.167,2145.576,Repayable over a ten year term with debt shared between Arenaco 75% and the city 25%.,39,,
398,0.97,2145.576,2148.679,Arenaco have guaranteed the debt payments.,39,,
399,0.97,2148.679,2159.123,They already have about $3.2 million associated with sponsorship proposals going towards a goal of $8 million this year.,39,,
400,0.97,2159.123,2162.994,And more in future years.,39,,
401,0.97,2162.994,2165.129,Debt repayment will commence in 2022.,39,,
402,0.97,2165.129,2170.735,Sponsorship revenue tied to the Signage will produce approximately $4 million annually.,39,,
403,0.97,2170.735,2180.311,"And the revenue is split for the first ten years 75% to Arenaco, 25% to Seattle center.",39,,
404,0.97,2180.311,2188.386,"That's an estimated $630,000 additional revenue to Seattle center above the required base level payments.",39,,
405,0.97,2188.386,2195.159,Starting in year 11 that funding proposal goes from 75/25 to 50/50.,39,,
406,0.97,2195.159,2201.499,The funding will include annual maintenance and replacement funding.,39,,
407,0.97,2201.499,2220.318,"And this is really about the city owns and will operate the campus signs, Seattle center will approve all the content on the sign and the bidding and construction of the signs will be done by the time the arena opens, we all have our fingers crossed.",39,,
408,0.97,2220.318,2225.59,At this point I would like to turn it over for questions.,39,,
409,0.97,2225.59,2230.361,I would just like to say we've been doing sponsorship Signage for decades.,39,,
410,0.97,2230.361,2234.365,It's just what we've been doing has been pretty ugly.,39,,
411,0.97,2234.365,2244.976,Seattle center is a decision maker on all these issues and Seattle center and Sdci are a decision maker on the exterior are within 20 feet of the right of way.,39,,
412,0.97,2244.976,2246.277,"This is sponsorship, not advertising.",39,,
413,0.97,2246.277,2253.384,Something that we have done for decades and this is a city asset that we the city will control.,39,,
414,0.97,2253.384,2259.49,And with that I'd just like to turn this over to any questions anyone has.,39,,
415,0.97,2259.49,2260.591,Excellent.,40,,
416,0.97,2260.591,2262.593,Really appreciate the presentation.,40,,
417,0.97,2262.593,2276.407,"Colleagues, I want to also reiterate that you see the point in the presentation that Arenaco will be paying 75% of the project's debt service while the Seattle center will be paying the other 25%.",40,,
418,0.97,2276.407,2297.295,Really appreciate the due diligence that went into this proposal today and the research by my office to ensure that we have the capacity to execute these bonds thanks to Andrew Huston from my office for doing a lot of research on this.,40,,
419,0.97,2297.295,2298.963,"Councilmembers, are there questions?",40,,
420,0.97,2298.963,2313.511,"I see according to the slides that the additional annual revenue that the city anticipates I believe the number was about $800,000?",41,,
421,0.97,2313.511,2314.178,Was that right?,41,,
422,0.97,2314.178,2314.512,A year?,41,,
423,0.97,2314.512,2319.317,"The additional revenue is around $630,000.",42,,
424,0.97,2319.317,2319.817,630.,43,,
425,0.97,2319.817,2321.152,Okay.,43,,
426,0.97,2321.152,2330.594,What I don't see is what the additional annual payment that the city or Seattle center will pay.,43,,
427,0.97,2330.594,2333.531,I'm assuming it's a comparable annual number?,43,,
428,0.97,2333.531,2333.864,Yeah.,44,,
429,0.97,2333.864,2346.711,"The total payment that is around $930,000 or something like that and the city's portion of that is $200 some thousand which comes out of the 600,000 we'd be getting.",44,,
430,0.97,2346.711,2349.78,"About 200,000 extra a year?",45,,
431,0.97,2349.78,2350.047,Yeah.,46,,
432,0.97,2350.047,2350.314,Okay.,47,,
433,0.97,2350.314,2351.215,Thank you.,47,,
434,0.97,2351.215,2364.495,And then on the sponsorship question you mentioned that the decision making is exclusively in the hands of Seattle center and that sponsorship is not advertisement.,47,,
435,0.97,2364.495,2375.906,Can you just talk a little bit about the difference between advertisement and sponsorship?,47,,
436,0.97,2375.906,2386.617,Specifically to the extent that you describe that the decision making around sponsorship is in the hands of the Seattle center how you go about making those decisions?,47,,
437,0.97,2386.617,2397.061,Advertisement is trying to get you to purchase something.,48,,
438,0.97,2397.061,2406.57,Sponsorship is trying to align with the system or that drives.,48,,
439,0.97,2406.57,2408.139,Excuse me.,48,,
440,0.97,2408.139,2415.78,Sponsorship is trying to align with products that the host entity has.,48,,
441,0.97,2415.78,2432.963,"If we have programming or an event or we have something that sponsorship is designed to be something in support of what we're already doing or in support of what comes on to make happen, et cetera.",48,,
442,0.97,2432.963,2435.099,Advertising is not what I do.,48,,
443,0.97,2435.099,2437.034,We don't do advertising.,48,,
444,0.97,2437.034,2437.535,We do sponsorship.,48,,
445,0.97,2437.535,2460.424,We would do something like winter fresh or we will do something.,48,,
446,0.97,2460.424,2463.794,That's one of the bigger differences I see in that.,48,,
447,0.97,2463.794,2466.53,The sponsorship is we don't do tobacco.,48,,
448,0.97,2466.53,2466.997,We don't do drugs.,48,,
449,0.97,2466.997,2472.036,We don't do things that are going to be negative for our societal views.,48,,
450,0.97,2472.036,2477.541,So those are things that we take into account as we're going through our decision making process.,48,,
451,0.97,2477.541,2486.083,We don't do things that would allow us to put a bad foot forward.,48,,
452,0.97,2486.083,2496.56,"Everything that we're doing is going to be something that's going to be family oriented or something that will be aligned with the city's values, the center's values, et cetera.",48,,
453,0.97,2496.56,2499.597,That's how we go about doing that.,48,,
454,0.97,2499.597,2506.804,I'm sorry for the Misspeak earlier.,48,,
455,0.97,2506.804,2507.238,Thank you.,49,,
456,0.97,2507.238,2508.339,That's helpful.,49,,
457,0.97,2508.339,2514.578,Who does the decision making though?,49,,
458,0.97,2514.578,2530.694,Is that sort of within the Seattle center family or do you get advice from the Seattle center advisory board or just want a little bit more texture on that process.,49,,
459,0.97,2530.694,2530.995,Thank you.,49,,
460,0.97,2530.995,2531.262,Okay.,50,,
461,0.97,2531.262,2532.096,Thank you.,50,,
462,0.97,2532.096,2535.232,The final decision is made by the director.,50,,
463,0.97,2535.232,2541.705,The way we structured this is that all of these decisions will go to the Seattle center advisory Commission.,50,,
464,0.97,2541.705,2551.882,Seattle center advisory Commission is leading an effort to identify and lay out our corporate guidelines for our sponsorship.,50,,
465,0.97,2551.882,2554.184,And we take all decisions like this to them.,50,,
466,0.97,2554.184,2559.957,They approve them and then come back to us.,50,,
467,0.97,2559.957,2565.296,We go forward with that.,50,,
468,0.97,2565.296,2565.93,Much appreciated.,51,,
469,0.97,2565.93,2567.231,Great questions.,52,,
470,0.97,2567.231,2570.501,Thank you very much.,52,,
471,0.97,2570.501,2572.603,Any additional questions?,52,,
472,0.97,2572.603,2577.474,Seattle center or Brian goodnight or central staff.,52,,
473,0.97,2577.474,2578.075,Council member Strauss.,52,,
474,0.97,2578.075,2580.611,Please go ahead.,52,,
475,0.97,2580.611,2581.745,"Thank you, chair.",53,,
476,0.97,2581.745,2583.18,"Thank you, director Nellams and your team.",53,,
477,0.97,2583.18,2588.986,I want to start with just a moment of gratitude.,53,,
478,0.97,2588.986,2594.758,This sign amendment or this presentation that you bring before us today is quite complex.,53,,
479,0.97,2594.758,2598.495,There are a lot of intricate and important details.,53,,
480,0.97,2598.495,2605.97,It pails in comparison to the deals you and your team have put together around climate pledge arena.,53,,
481,0.97,2605.97,2613.31,Around the partnership with Seattle public schools in both Memorial Stadium and with the center school.,53,,
482,0.97,2613.31,2623.387,"Just looking at this campus map I start at the 11:00 hour and go clock wise I see we have Kexp, we have the repertory theater, we have the ballet.",53,,
483,0.97,2623.387,2626.056,We have the opera.,53,,
484,0.97,2626.056,2634.064,We have Memorial Stadium with Seattle public schools and things going on there.,53,,
485,0.97,2634.064,2636.133,We have the space needle.,53,,
486,0.97,2636.133,2637.935,It's not Iconic at all.,53,,
487,0.97,2637.935,2638.302,I swear.,53,,
488,0.97,2638.302,2640.304,We have the class museum.,53,,
489,0.97,2640.304,2645.042,We have the children's theater.,53,,
490,0.97,2645.042,2645.309,Seattle.,53,,
491,0.97,2645.309,2645.743,The science center.,53,,
492,0.97,2645.743,2651.448,"Then, Yeah, and if I missed any, just let me know.",53,,
493,0.97,2651.448,2656.22,I want to ground us in that context.,53,,
494,0.97,2656.22,2661.992,It is complex and it Peal pales in comparison.,53,,
495,0.97,2661.992,2664.728,I want to start with thanks.,53,,
496,0.97,2664.728,2668.532,I was maybe flippant about the space needle.,53,,
497,0.97,2668.532,2668.899,It is Iconic.,53,,
498,0.97,2668.899,2671.168,It is within the Footprint of your campus.,53,,
499,0.97,2671.168,2673.17,So I do have a number of questions.,53,,
500,0.97,2673.17,2679.81,I believe that I know the answers to them but I just want to put a fine point on them.,53,,
501,0.97,2679.81,2697.728,So this change would allow the city to issue an additional $8 million in bonds to fund the science project but it would not stipulate the cost sharing between the city and Arenaco.,53,,
502,0.97,2697.728,2700.764,The cost sharing would be spelled out in a separate agreement?,53,,
503,0.97,2700.764,2708.906,I believe so but I don't know that to be true.,54,,
504,0.97,2708.906,2709.173,Okay.,55,,
505,0.97,2709.173,2711.775,"Brian, do you have that understanding?",55,,
506,0.97,2711.775,2712.042,Yes.,56,,
507,0.97,2712.042,2714.311,It looks like Tom might want to step in as well.,56,,
508,0.97,2714.311,2733.797,Seattle center and the law Department are working with Arenaco to finalize an agreement that will formalize the cost sharing split.,56,,
509,0.97,2733.797,2746.577,If the tentative agreement cannot be finalized is the city obligated to sell these bonds with the passage of the bill today?,57,,
510,0.97,2746.577,2747.511,I'll have Brian answer that.,58,,
511,0.97,2747.511,2753.383,So my understanding is that given the Timeline and Seattle center can specify the Timeline they're working on.,59,,
512,0.97,2753.383,2756.12,That the bonds likely would still be sold.,59,,
513,0.97,2756.12,2758.755,Currently plan to be sold at the beginning of May.,59,,
514,0.97,2758.755,2762.893,There's a lot of steps that happen with FAS leading up to that plan.,59,,
515,0.97,2762.893,2765.262,Likely the bonds would be sold regardless.,59,,
516,0.97,2765.262,2773.37,The city does have ways of if the project doesn't come to fruition bond proceeds are not very Fudgable.,59,,
517,0.97,2773.37,2776.707,They can't be applied to other projects.,59,,
518,0.97,2776.707,2782.379,There would have to make arrangements to hold the funding to repay them when it's appropriate.,59,,
519,0.97,2782.379,2783.714,I might just step in.,60,,
520,0.97,2783.714,2795.959,I think what would happen is we wouldn't go ahead with the project and then the bond funds to be available.,60,,
521,0.97,2795.959,2798.462,That's most likely what would happen.,60,,
522,0.97,2798.462,2806.436,"So if I was, which I am a risk Averse person this would be a safe measure to pass today.",61,,
523,0.97,2806.436,2810.507,I'm seeing nodding heads across the zoom room.,61,,
524,0.97,2810.507,2813.544,Can you remind me what the revenue split.,61,,
525,0.97,2813.544,2815.412,I know you mentioned this before.,61,,
526,0.97,2815.412,2818.282,Just to put a final point on it.,61,,
527,0.97,2818.282,2830.494,The revenue split between Arenaco and the Seattle center for sponsorship revenue and how does it relate to the 75/25 split.,61,,
528,0.97,2830.494,2831.228,It's basically the same.,62,,
529,0.97,2831.228,2835.365,75% in the first ten years to Arenaco.,62,,
530,0.97,2835.365,2836.433,25% to the city.,62,,
531,0.97,2836.433,2839.97,After the first ten years it's 50/50.,62,,
532,0.97,2839.97,2856.32,The beauty of this from our standpoint is not only do we get the signs we need but that the signs will most likely last longer than those ten years and then when we're getting into a 50/50 split our revenues will go up.,62,,
533,0.97,2856.32,2856.687,Wonderful.,63,,
534,0.97,2856.687,2856.987,Thank you.,63,,
535,0.97,2856.987,2863.427,I know you answered the Followup question for Council member Herbold about the sponsorship.,63,,
536,0.97,2863.427,2875.839,The difference between sponsorship and advertising and I guess I'll ask some more clarifying questions because it was such a privilege to get to work with you to put forward the original sign code amendment the.,63,,
537,0.97,2875.839,2882.246,One thing you shared with me at that time was one of the difference between advertising and sponsorship.,63,,
538,0.97,2882.246,2885.015,Let's say Alaska Airlines wants to be our sponsor.,63,,
539,0.97,2885.015,2888.785,They can put up a sign that says sponsored by Alaska Airlines.,63,,
540,0.97,2888.785,2897.227,What they could not put up is a sign that says for this weekend only you can get a $25 flight to Los Angeles.,63,,
541,0.97,2897.227,2897.527,Right.,64,,
542,0.97,2897.527,2906.837,Can you kind of expand on that concept so that we have a better understanding of the difference between sponsorship and advertising?,65,,
543,0.97,2906.837,2907.204,Well Yeah.,66,,
544,0.97,2907.204,2911.708,In advertising the goal is to try to get you to do something.,66,,
545,0.97,2911.708,2918.081,And sponsorship the goal is to try to get you to feel something.,66,,
546,0.97,2918.081,2928.158,And sponsorship you're trying to feel that the product or the sponsor is associated with the thing that you love or the thing you're doing or the thing you're going with.,66,,
547,0.97,2928.158,2942.272,So that's why it's attractive for people to be engaged in this process with Arenaco and about Seattle center because there's a lot of things happening that they would like to be associated with.,66,,
548,0.97,2942.272,2942.572,Et cetera.,66,,
549,0.97,2942.572,2954.318,And that allows us an ability to drive some revenue to us that allows us to do other things Besides some of the things that we're doing.,66,,
550,0.97,2954.318,2962.159,Winter Fest or any other program that doesn't cost anybody in the city any money to attend.,66,,
551,0.97,2962.159,2963.46,"Thank you, director Nellams.",67,,
552,0.97,2963.46,2971.568,"What I'm hearing you say is these, anyone who wants to put their name on a sign is saying they support your work.",67,,
553,0.97,2971.568,2981.712,"Not here come get the latest greatest deal from us on X, Y or Z. I think that's just such an important nuance.",67,,
554,0.97,2981.712,2997.961,"You know, we had, the sign code that is around the Seattle center has exceptions for what the sign code is in the rest of the city and this is one of those really important details that makes me support what you're doing.",67,,
555,0.97,2997.961,3000.263,"I also, could you speak briefly.",67,,
556,0.97,3000.263,3017.914,"I know we're not here to talk about the sign code, but just for reference Seattle center has changes or exceptions to the city sign code regarding back lit signs and can you just remind me this does not allow for flashing signs.",67,,
557,0.97,3017.914,3020.117,We have to keep a consistent panel.,67,,
558,0.97,3020.117,3023.954,We're not going to turn out like Las Vegas or New York.,67,,
559,0.97,3023.954,3025.422,"No, over my dead body.",68,,
560,0.97,3025.422,3028.692,W will not do anything like that.,68,,
561,0.97,3028.692,3030.827,We will have some Digital signs.,68,,
562,0.97,3030.827,3033.897,There'll be some changing images that will happen.,68,,
563,0.97,3033.897,3042.606,"But it will not be things that will be disturbing or distracting to drivers, et cetera.",68,,
564,0.97,3042.606,3049.546,"We will have some signs that will change periodically, et cetera.",68,,
565,0.97,3049.546,3055.218,And they will tell the story of all the things that are happening at Seattle center.,68,,
566,0.97,3055.218,3065.028,"They will tell the story of all those people who are promoting Seattle center as part of their way of saying Yeah, we're with them too.",68,,
567,0.97,3065.028,3065.395,Excellent.,69,,
568,0.97,3065.395,3065.996,Thank you.,69,,
569,0.97,3065.996,3073.67,One thing that you mentioned is that these new signs will allow us to be able to communicate in multiple languages.,69,,
570,0.97,3073.67,3076.173,I want to highlight that again.,69,,
571,0.97,3076.173,3093.657,"My last question here is, and maybe it's more after statement about when I started my comments maybe ten minutes ago now we talked about all of the different entities that are on our public land in the Seattle center.",69,,
572,0.97,3093.657,3103.9,"Seattle center and your work unifies all of these very, I mean, there is.",69,,
573,0.97,3103.9,3105.235,Glass Museum and Kexp.,69,,
574,0.97,3105.235,3105.802,Very different.,69,,
575,0.97,3105.802,3109.206,The ballet and science center.,69,,
576,0.97,3109.206,3109.573,Very different.,69,,
577,0.97,3109.573,3122.986,Can you speak to why it is so important that we or I guess on one hand having so many different types of signs creates disjointed feeling.,69,,
578,0.97,3122.986,3130.227,And having a consistent type of sign is able to unify all of these different types of entities.,69,,
579,0.97,3130.227,3132.662,I guess Maybe I answered my own question there.,69,,
580,0.97,3132.662,3135.565,Anything else to say on that?,69,,
581,0.97,3135.565,3155.085,I'd just like to say that the ability to have a one type of sign that goes across the campus that is uniform that is consistent and that doesn't beat you over the head because it's around every bin or whatever is what we're trying to do here.,70,,
582,0.97,3155.085,3169.966,"So being able to communicate to people, being able to share what's all happening because you mention all the entities that are at Seattle center if you come here it's almost impossible to know what's all happening.",70,,
583,0.97,3169.966,3181.044,And so we're going to try to communicate a lot of that to people and give them an opportunity to discover so much more than maybe what they came to see.,70,,
584,0.97,3181.044,3185.315,I can't wait.,71,,
585,0.97,3185.315,3187.784,I really can't wait.,71,,
586,0.97,3187.784,3188.318,Thank you so much.,71,,
587,0.97,3188.318,3190.287,Literally changing the face of Seattle.,71,,
588,0.97,3190.287,3195.125,One last comment and not for you to respond to.,71,,
589,0.97,3195.125,3196.66,This is just an opinion.,71,,
590,0.97,3196.66,3202.532,Personal importance and significance to me is that I doubly it is important that we use our bonding authority to move this project forward.,71,,
591,0.97,3202.532,3211.007,I also find it very troubling that we are not using our bonding authority to the fullest extent possible to address the homelessness crisis.,71,,
592,0.97,3211.007,3214.911,As we heard this morning with all the callers calling in we have urgent needs.,71,,
593,0.97,3214.911,3218.615,We have the solutions that we know that work.,71,,
594,0.97,3218.615,3221.818,We have effective programs we just don't have them to the scale of the crisis.,71,,
595,0.97,3221.818,3226.59,We need to get these solutions up and running.,71,,
596,0.97,3226.59,3227.49,"Director Nellams, Dn't respond to that.",71,,
597,0.97,3227.49,3231.127,We need to keep your project moving and address homelessness.,71,,
598,0.97,3231.127,3234.464,Government can do more than one thing at once.,71,,
599,0.97,3234.464,3234.764,Thank you.,71,,
600,0.97,3234.764,3235.231,"Thank you, sir.",72,,
601,0.97,3235.231,3240.103,Does thank you very much.,73,,
602,0.97,3240.103,3240.604,Councilmember Strauss.,73,,
603,0.97,3240.604,3246.309,I think that helps lead into conversations I've been having with central staff about them both.,73,,
604,0.97,3246.309,3261.391,"Given the on going conversations that we will soon hear about regarding some other potential bonds we may not have to do, I think there is a lot of potential for us to use bonding going forward to address other issues like housing and homelessness services.",73,,
605,0.97,3261.391,3267.731,Looking forward to working with you to make sure that we do the both and approach here.,73,,
606,0.97,3267.731,3271.835,On this topic I don't see any other hands raised.,73,,
607,0.97,3271.835,3276.006,I do want to tee up Brian goodnight to talk about an amendment.,73,,
608,0.97,3276.006,3289.786,"Colleagues, you saw in an E- mail from me and I spoke to it yesterday during Council briefing I sent around amendment number 1 to help correct an issue that central staff have helped identify.",73,,
609,0.97,3289.786,3309.272,Up to 70 million bonds issued to repay the Interfund loan for the repair of the West Seattle bridge approved last September Úmay be issued as tax exempt bonds.,73,,
610,0.97,3309.272,3323.987,Fas anticipates that the issuance would . would you like to provide additional context to the amendment we circulated yesterday?,73,,
611,0.97,3323.987,3330.026,Thank you for your good work and catching this to fix that.,73,,
612,0.97,3330.026,3330.393,Thank you.,74,,
613,0.97,3330.393,3332.629,I've just put the amendment up on the screen.,74,,
614,0.97,3332.629,3335.098,I think you have pretty much said all of it.,74,,
615,0.97,3335.098,3347.677,I will just add that the section that it adds is a section 4 to the bill and it Renumbers the following sections appropriately.,74,,
616,0.97,3347.677,3348.278,It corrects an oversight.,74,,
617,0.97,3348.278,3356.82,So this makes clear the Council's intent that the inner fund loans may be reimbursed with tax exempt bonds.,74,,
618,0.97,3356.82,3368.898,Important catch to make sure that we are able to capture that back and potentially use it for things like what Councilmember Strauss just spoke to.,75,,
619,0.97,3368.898,3371.367,I don't see any questions on this.,75,,
620,0.97,3371.367,3373.503,Any questions before we consider a vote?,75,,
621,0.97,3373.503,3373.703,Okay.,75,,
622,0.97,3373.703,3374.604,Looks like we're right on time.,75,,
623,0.97,3374.604,3381.077,I want to thank the Presenters.,75,,
624,0.97,3381.077,3382.545,Thank you very much.,75,,
625,0.97,3382.545,3386.015,I really do anticipate there will be a few more questions before full council.,75,,
626,0.97,3386.015,3394.591,If you do hear from other Councilmembers we are happy to try to answer those questions but also happy to pass them on to you.,75,,
627,0.97,3394.591,3402.866,Colleagues I move the committee recommends passage of Council bill 120006 to put this bill in front of us.,75,,

699,0.97,3666.295,3673.336,That resolution established a Proactive approach for increasing Council's oversight of capital projects.,103,,
700,0.97,3673.336,3681.811,"Particularly those with a range of quote, perceived significant questions about scope, schedule and budget.",103,,
701,0.97,3681.811,3697.326,"Among other things that 2018 resolution established a reporting framework and anticipated that each year that Council would adopt an annual watch list of quote, large, complex, discreet capital projects, end quote.",103,,
702,0.97,3697.326,3721.784,The idea was to provide both the Council and the public with regular updates about the watch list projects so as to provide not only a sense of emerging challenges on those projects but also a perspective view of the potential strategies that the city may be considering employing.,103,,
703,0.97,3721.784,3733.262,During 2019 the Council adopted a watch list of about a dozen to 15 projects and the executive provided quarterly reports on each of those projects.,103,,
704,0.97,3733.262,3749.679,"During 2020 the Council also adopted a similarly sized watch list, however due to staffing constraints related to the pandemic the executive was only able to provide high level summary information about those projects during 2020.",103,,
705,0.97,3749.679,3760.823,Rather than providing information in the enhanced quarterly reporting format.,103,,
706,0.97,3760.823,3768.931,Today's action resolution 31991 would request enhanced quarterly reports on a select list of capital projects.,103,,
707,0.97,3768.931,3779.842,"Consistent with provision in the 2018 resolution, the executive has Dually proposed a list.",103,,
708,0.97,3779.842,3797.66,That is included in the resolution on today's agenda.,103,,
709,0.97,3797.66,3805.334,I understand from are a couple of amendments.,103,,
710,0.97,3805.334,3813.376,The executive expects to be able to resume quarterly reports.,103,,
711,0.97,3813.376,3825.988,For each project the reports are expected to address costs in the context of the overall projects lifetime budget.,103,,
712,0.97,3825.988,3835.798,Schedule versus the established baseline milestones for the project and also and I think most importantly an analysis of the potential risks that each project faces.,103,,
713,0.97,3835.798,3847.71,That's accompanied with a discussion of the strategies that the executive anticipates employing to manage those risks.,103,,
714,0.97,3847.71,3861.724,"Resolution 31991 consistent with previous Iterations of the annual watch list anticipates that the Council's Finance and housing committee will be the forum for reviewing those, the enhanced quarterly reports.",103,,
715,0.97,3861.724,3865.595,And that concludes my staff report.,103,,
716,0.97,3865.595,3871.567,As you mentioned in your opening remarks there are I believe two potential amendments that Council members may be interested in moving.,103,,
717,0.97,3871.567,3872.602,Thank you very much.,104,,
718,0.97,3872.602,3879.041,Before we move to amendments are there any questions for Dan?,104,,
719,0.97,3879.041,3885.147,Any general comments on the process or report back as you read in the staff memo?,104,,
720,0.97,3885.147,3885.348,Okay.,104,,
721,0.97,3885.348,3886.882,I am not seeing any general comments.,104,,
722,0.97,3886.882,3890.553,Let's go ahead and move to the amendments.,104,,
723,0.97,3890.553,3892.655,We may have more discussion there.,104,,
724,0.97,3892.655,3893.155,Councilmember Strauss.,104,,
725,0.97,3893.155,3896.192,I see you are listed as the first amendment.,104,,
726,0.97,3896.192,3904.767,You are recognized to move amendment number one.,104,,
727,0.97,3904.767,3909.138,Move amendment one Smithco park.,105,,
728,0.97,3909.138,3909.639,It's been Seconded.,106,,
729,0.97,3909.639,3911.107,Speak to your amendment.,106,,
730,0.97,3911.107,3917.88,I just want to thank you chair for your indulgence on this item.,107,,
731,0.97,3917.88,3923.786,My amendment would add Smithco back to the capital watch list.,107,,
732,0.97,3923.786,3930.826,Was added to the 2020 watch list and it was attempted to be removed from the 2020 watch list.,107,,
733,0.97,3930.826,3935.197,It was attempted to be removed from this year's proposed watch list.,107,,
734,0.97,3935.197,3940.803,In part because the executive justification for moving the project is that it's currently on hold.,107,,
735,0.97,3940.803,3951.514,Other projects on this list are on hold such as the center city streetcar--center city Connector streetcar remain on this list.,107,,
736,0.97,3951.514,3966.062,Smith Co Park is important to me to remain on this list because it is has experienced so many delays over the years and it's important we keep this project on the watch list to highlight the delays and keep attention to moving it forward.,107,,
737,0.97,3966.062,3974.971,With the project on hold it should not cost departments significant time or resources to include Smithco park on their watch list reports.,107,,
738,0.97,3974.971,3978.908,And it will keep it at top of their minds.,107,,
739,0.97,3978.908,3985.581,I am very committed with I know Councilmember Lewis has taken over the lead on this.,107,,
740,0.97,3985.581,3993.055,I'm very committed to seeing Smithco park completed.,107,,
741,0.97,3993.055,4000.996,"This is a as Councilmember Lewis will probably speak to, this was an inter, many different levels of government working together.",107,,
742,0.97,4000.996,4001.964,"The County, the port, the city.",107,,
743,0.97,4001.964,4011.54,We need to do our part to get it finished.,107,,
744,0.97,4011.54,4014.143,Should be on to phase two.,107,,
745,0.97,4014.143,4016.545,We're not there yet.,107,,
746,0.97,4016.545,4020.182,With the chair's indulgence I'd love to add this amendment back.,107,,
747,0.97,4020.182,4025.454,I am very committed to seeing Smith Co park finished.,107,,
748,0.97,4025.454,4026.389,"Thank you, chair.",107,,
749,0.97,4026.389,4034.73,Are there any questions for Councilmember Strauss on amendment number one?,108,,
750,0.97,4034.73,4035.197,Councilmember Lewis.,108,,

752,0.97,4035.931,4052.448,Not a question just want to thank Councilmember Strauss for bringing this forward and thank him for his work and his previous role working directly for the people of district 7 as a legislative aide to my predecessor.,109,,
753,0.97,4052.448,4074.703,I still remember last year when we had this exact same discussion at approximately the same time Councilmember Strauss entering into the record a picture with sort of the ground breaking with then Mayor Mcginn just to give an indication and to date how long this important project has been pending.,109,,
754,0.97,4074.703,4085.648,I want to just briefly lift up the community members who I know have been organizing and working hard for this.,109,,
755,0.97,4085.648,4088.35,Bruce Harper on the magnolia community Council.,109,,
756,0.97,4088.35,4109.438,"People who have been working with the port with the parks Department, with the city to get this over the finish line and I do think that this is an important measure today to just remind that community that we are still here with you pushing on this important project.",109,,
757,0.97,4109.438,4111.774,We want to see it completed.,109,,

764,0.97,4139.935,4143.772,Council member Lewis has taken the lead on this.,112,,
765,0.97,4143.772,4144.94,Thankful to get to work.,112,,

789,0.97,4202.998,4229.258,"In addition to background around how we got to the process for creating a watch list, we've had numerous discussions over the years since 2018 where we talked about including sort of program attic elements as part of the watch list.",127,,
790,0.97,4229.258,4240.269,The capital improvement program is not just distinct for individual projects.,127,,
791,0.97,4240.269,4241.203,It includes multiyear projects.,127,,
792,0.97,4241.203,4262.491,So the legislation requested back in 2018 in this section nine that the executive work with Council central staff to develop aimed for enhanced reporting for selected on going programs or components of on going programs for potential inclusion in the watch list.,127,,
793,0.97,4262.491,4280.442,"The budget director, director noble has committed to working with central staff to develop an approach to implement Sectionnine while noting would require a different approach than for individual capital projects.",127,,
794,0.97,4280.442,4287.916,This amendment is designed to try and pilot a new reporting format for on going projects.,127,,
795,0.97,4287.916,4296.258,There are 300 or so on going programs between the various departments.,127,,
796,0.97,4296.258,4306.568,An example that I think we've all become familiar with over the last year is bridge maintenance.,127,,
797,0.97,4306.568,4327.489,"But the departments that include on going programmatic projects is not unique to Sdot, city light, parks Department, FAS, Seattle center and it all have on going CIP projects.",127,,

820,0.97,4378.607,4380.943,Any additional comments on resolution 31991 as amended.,140,,
821,0.97,4380.943,4381.51,Councilmember Herbold.,140,,
822,0.97,4381.51,4409.171,One of the things I have mentioned in the past when we've heard the annual watch list resolution is expressing my hope that we hope internally as a Council commit to sort of Daylighting the projects that fall in our committee when the watch list reports come back to us.,141,,
823,0.97,4409.171,4421.049,They come back I think to you as the chair of the committee with oversight activity budget office.,141,,
824,0.97,4421.049,4443.005,You can't be expected to hear the updates on projects from departments all over the city so my hope has always been that committees that have for instance parks in it or or Sdot or the utilities.,141,,
825,0.97,4443.005,4450.245,That we collectively agree to have that sort of higher level of scrutiny when we get the watch list reports back to us in our own committees.,141,,
826,0.97,4450.245,4456.018,That's sort of a piece of it I think some committee chairs do informally.,141,,
827,0.97,4456.018,4472.067,It's one of those things I think would be great if we figured out a way in the future to formalize that expectation amongst ourselves.,141,,
828,0.97,4472.067,4477.539,In highlighting that desire.,141,,
829,0.97,4477.539,4478.14,Thank you.,141,,
830,0.97,4478.14,4485.347,To ensure there's more transparent calendar of when we could expect that to be shared in various committees?,142,,
831,0.97,4485.347,4488.25,Should we Brainstorm on that suggestion?,142,,
832,0.97,4488.25,4505.167,I think that's something that is a discussion that I can continue to have with Council members on this Committee and chairs of the committees with jurisdiction over the capital heavy departments.,143,,
833,0.97,4505.167,4506.034,Thank you very much.,144,,
834,0.97,4506.034,4508.203,I do remember you bringing that up before.,144,,
835,0.97,4508.203,4520.115,Last year was obviously a hectic year for all but we need to recognize this is somewhat of a new normal in terms of work flow coming at us.,144,,
836,0.97,4520.115,4522.117,Make sure this doesn't get lost as well.,144,,
837,0.97,4522.117,4528.323,Look forward to following up with you on that.,144,,
838,0.97,4528.323,4529.191,Wonderful.,144,,

869,0.97,4622.618,4649.177,"As you will see from the presentation in front of us this is an opportunity for us to really have a better understanding a more transparent conversation with the public, with members of Council and our regional partners about how Federal dollars could potentially be used to continue to support the vital services this Council has Prioritized as systems for small businesses, worker support, child care assistance.",158,,
870,0.97,4649.177,4663.458,"Making sure our core government services are ready to open again to infuse opportunities for resiliency, equity and more equitable recovery as we think about reopening our local economy here.",158,,
871,0.97,4663.458,4673.235,"There is a really important conversation to be had not just about the Federal funds that are going to be discussed today, but also about what Council would like to do.",158,,
872,0.97,4673.235,4682.344,"As you will see in one of the slides that we'll begin the presentation, this is one of four items the Council will have a chance to engage on.",158,,
873,0.97,4682.344,4692.921,We are talking about a potential resolution outlining Council's principles and spending priorities for use with the American recovery plan act.,158,,
874,0.97,4692.921,4699.327,And how that direct aid the anticipated $221 million to the city of Seattle can be dispersed.,158,,
875,0.97,4699.327,4713.108,There is also a chance for us to come back as soon as and in option of the congressional action to pass the $1.9 trillion that Congress is currently debating right now.,158,,
876,0.97,4713.108,4718.747,And we will begin preparing a second item for your consideration.,158,,
877,0.97,4718.747,4735.063,"We are going to prepare and begin deliberations on legislation that would accept an authorized spending of direct aid as quick as possible to make sure that funding gets directly into the hands of those who most need it, anticipating the final passage in DC and wanting to be prepared for that.",158,,
878,0.97,4735.063,4753.915,The other two items that are going to be very important for this Council to continue to deliberate on and provide direction is accepting and Thorizing the expenditure of the $22.7 million of emergency rental assistance provided by the consolidated appropriations act.,158,,
879,0.97,4753.915,4754.483,That passed in December.,158,,
880,0.97,4754.483,4759.154,We have yet to receive that spending directive.,158,,
881,0.97,4759.154,4766.428,This is something the Council will have a chance to amend and provide direction on.,158,,
882,0.97,4766.428,4790.752,The fourth item we as a Council also continue to have deliberations on and potential action is the on going conversation that will continue on to item number 4 on today's agenda which is considering any potential legislation or direction authorizing expenditures to support programs like just cares program or a robust Hoteling strategy such as that.,158,,
883,0.97,4790.752,4797.225,This is really I think an exciting opportunity for us to continue the hard work that Council engaged in a year ago.,158,,
884,0.97,4797.225,4799.06,Almost a year ago to date.,158,,
885,0.97,4799.06,4812.707,We have all been engaged in various conversations about how we as a Council can act locally and with urgency to respond to the crises we are seeing unfold as it relates to Covid.,158,,
886,0.97,4812.707,4818.747,You all as Council acted quickly when we passed our initial Covid relief bill.,158,,
887,0.97,4818.747,4828.089,"$86Million was what we had anticipated to try to get out the door for things like cash assistance, food assistance, child care, housing support services.",158,,
888,0.97,4828.089,4841.203,And it is with that in mind that we asked our incredible team from central staff to work relatively quickly to come up with a resolution for us today.,158,,
889,0.97,4841.203,4870.932,"Yolanda's E-mail she sent yesterday about 3:20 in the afternoon really outlines the principles that we will be discussing today as we think about receiving Federal dollars and the way in which Council would like to look back at this one year history of us trying to be preemptive and Proactive about how we utilize resources available to us both in reserves and in partnership with the state and now with additional partnership from the Federal level, really acting with urgency.",158,,
890,0.97,4870.932,4885.08,So I really want to underscore the importance of this work building on the past support that this Council has already authorized and the importance of us acting quickly to provide direction.,158,,
891,0.97,4885.08,4891.987,Some assurance to community members at large that we'll be working with urgency to get these Federal dollars out the door.,158,,
892,0.97,4891.987,4906.735,"As Yolanda noted in her E-mail, the priority investments draft resolution in front of us helped, was helped by the previous priorities that the Council identified through the 2020 budget revisions.",158,,
893,0.97,4906.735,4910.005,The jump start Covid relief plan and the 2021 adopted budget.,158,,
894,0.97,4910.005,4914.142,So thank you for all of your past work on this Council colleagues and central staff.,158,,
895,0.97,4914.142,4922.851,The work that you have done we know is already making a tremendous impact and yet there is so much unmet need out there in the community.,158,,
896,0.97,4922.851,4934.796,"I really appreciate that the Council central staff, appreciate the leadership here and the way in which Yolanda outlined the following considerations were kept in mind.",158,,
897,0.97,4934.796,4949.377,"The need to begin pivoting the city's effort from acute emergency relief to really the longer term strategy and the longer term community recovery so we have that resilient, equitable recovery on the rye stop.",158,,
898,0.97,4949.377,4960.889,The potential to leverage other local state and Federal dollars to make sure we are multiplying our local dollars to the greatest extent possible that we capitalize on the Multiplier effect.,158,,
899,0.97,4960.889,4972.5,Finally that there is a recognition that the city's capacity constraints would be limited--would limit our ability to continue to deliver services.,158,,
900,0.97,4972.5,4989.651,"We are very aware that the National data shows that if we engage in austerity budgets picture we cut city services the projected longevity of the depression to our local economy will only be worse and more harmful, especially to smaller businesses.",158,,
901,0.97,4989.651,4993.855,We saw all those charts when we were I canning the Covid relief bill.,158,,
902,0.97,4993.855,5005.7,"In an effort to try to make sure we're being prepared to reopen our community we want to invest in continued city services and deliver our services, especially to the most vulnerable.",158,,
903,0.97,5005.7,5011.072,I will not steal your thunder about the eight principles you have built the resolution around.,158,,
904,0.97,5011.072,5019.114,I did want to lift up some of those pieces in the E-mail you sent to our Council yesterday.,158,,
905,0.97,5019.114,5022.317,I'll turn it over to ally or Yolanda.,158,,
906,0.97,5022.317,5025.52,I'll turn it over to Aly.,158,,
907,0.97,5025.52,5031.893,If you want to introduce yourself that would be fantastic.,158,,
908,0.97,5031.893,5038.166,"Thank you, chair Mosqueda.",159,,
909,0.97,5038.166,5038.533,Good morning.,159,,
910,0.97,5038.533,5039.501,I'm Aly Pennucci.,159,,
911,0.97,5039.501,5056.418,"As chair Mosqueda described, today we will present information that builds on the discussion that's been on going in this Committee and what was presented two weeks ago by the city budget office and office of Intergovernmentmental relations where they provided an update on known and potential Federal funding.",159,,
912,0.97,5056.418,5075.136,The idea is to have these discussions inform decisions Council will be considering on how best to use the anticipated additional Federal funds that are intended to address the on going public health needs in the short and long term impact and social impacts of the Covid- 19 pandemic.,159,,
913,0.97,5075.136,5085.413,In this presentation today we will update the Committee on the use of the Coronavirus relief funds received in 2020.,159,,
914,0.97,5085.413,5088.45,"Crf, moving forward.",159,,
915,0.97,5088.45,5097.025,And requests made to date for FEMA reimbursements.,159,,
916,0.97,5097.025,5101.729,The information was provided last week by the budget office and office of emergency management.,159,,
917,0.97,5101.729,5108.736,This is presenting the changes from what was presented last summer to what we know today.,159,,
918,0.97,5108.736,5114.576,We have some understanding of why certain changes were made.,159,,
919,0.97,5114.576,5120.882,But in cases CBO and others are likely better positioned to respond to questions about the why.,159,,
920,0.97,5120.882,5133.995,I also want to note that related to the information about expenditures that the city has or is planning to submit for FEMA reimbursement the numbers are estimated baited on incurred costs to date.,159,,
921,0.97,5133.995,5145.54,Office of emergency management is reviewing spending and other supporting documentation from departments in order to determine how much will eventually be submitted for FEMA reimbursement.,159,,
922,0.97,5145.54,5149.41,These numbers are just estimates about what we know today.,159,,
923,0.97,5149.41,5159.32,Following that update we will provide an overview of some of the appropriations in the 2021 adopted budget that support Covid response efforts.,159,,
924,0.97,5159.32,5165.026,Describe known and potential future funding and what we know about the possible use of those funds.,159,,
925,0.97,5165.026,5181.543,Present some analysis of the city's fiscal reserves and future use of payroll expense tax to inform your future decisions about how best to use the anticipated Federal funds and we will brief the committee as Councilmember Mosqueda described.,159,,
926,0.97,5181.543,5184.045,Principles and priorities for that funding.,159,,
927,0.97,5184.045,5205.667,Following that I'll briefly describe some next steps for this on going discussion and I'll just NOTE here that following Committee later this week we will be distributing a memo with more details that fill out some of what we're presenting today but as chair Mosqueda noted we have been working in Realtime sort of building the bicycle as we try to ride it.,159,,
928,0.97,5205.667,5207.936,That will be following in a few days.,159,,
929,0.97,5207.936,5220.215,With that I will.,159,,
930,0.97,5220.448,5226.721,I believe Aly did a good job of talking about the over view of the presentation.,160,,
931,0.97,5226.721,5230.325,We'll dive in with the next slide.,160,,
932,0.97,5230.325,5244.172,"This slide here covers just the general terminology that I'll be using, talking about the different types of funding that have been deployed to the Covid response so far.",160,,
933,0.97,5244.172,5254.582,It just helps to understand largely with regard to the timing and availability of the funds.,160,,
934,0.97,5254.582,5255.75,First we have grants.,160,,
935,0.97,5255.75,5266.494,Grants are direct aid dollars given to the city to use on the expenditures Defineed by the donor.,160,,
936,0.97,5266.494,5275.203,They're characterized on providing immediate infusion to meet the needs and it influences the resources the city has to deploy towards the needs.,160,,
937,0.97,5275.203,5293.688,"To receive this type of aid, as you will be familiar with, the Council passes one or more ordinances to accept the moneys indicating which Department directors have the authority to spend, which funds receive the moneys and those types of things.",160,,
938,0.97,5293.688,5303.464,It is a very specific process that can coordinate and controls the money and where it is allocated for immediate use in the budget.,160,,
939,0.97,5303.464,5304.432,Another category is Reimbursable expenditures.,160,,
940,0.97,5304.432,5313.608,These are moneys that the city pays out of existing budget lines to also meet emergency response need.,160,,
941,0.97,5313.608,5335.663,"Those are different from grants in that they, in order to be reimbursed, the city engages in a process that is stipulated by the granting agency, which in many cases is the Federal emergency agency.",160,,
942,0.97,5335.663,5345.206,They collect the expenditures and keep the receipts and fill out the applications and try to meet the requirements to meet the guidelines that are stipulated in that available aid.,160,,
943,0.97,5345.206,5361.823,"Because of the fact that this is a reimbursement process, this doesn't, unlike grants and direct aid, this doesn't give the city any Enhancement to the resources that are available to deploy to the emergency.",160,,
944,0.97,5361.823,5366.194,"It also often times, is not a One-On-One match.",160,,
945,0.97,5366.194,5378.005,"Sometimes the city has to come up with a portion of the expense and then the Grantor agency or FEMA would apply the share, just to put it another way.",160,,
946,0.97,5378.005,5390.618,"This is talking about the matching provision, for example, and I'll cover this a bit later with the FEMA response, there was a 25% matching requirement.",160,,
947,0.97,5390.618,5399.994,"The city would incur expense, 25% of which was on the city's dime and the remaining 75% would come from potential reimbursement in the future.",160,,
948,0.97,5399.994,5409.17,"When I say reimbursement in the future, it can take a number of years.",160,,
949,0.97,5409.17,5409.871,Every emergency is different.,160,,
950,0.97,5409.871,5418.045,Some less complex civil emergencies than the one we're in now have taken up to three years.,160,,
951,0.97,5418.045,5418.813,"Thank you, Tom.",161,,
952,0.97,5418.813,5422.583,Vice chair Herbold has a question.,161,,
953,0.97,5422.583,5422.95,Thank you.,162,,
954,0.97,5422.95,5456.717,"As it relates to the types of Reimbursable expenditures that the city seeks, I have heard reference to a Preapproval process, sort of on the front end, that if the city is anticipating, in the future, seeking reimbursement under, for instance, FEMA, that there is a process on the front end to get Preapproval of a project.",162,,
955,0.97,5456.717,5470.231,"Can you, am I remembering correctly that that relates to FEMA or is that only related to the Crf funding or potentially both or neither?",162,,
956,0.97,5470.231,5480.975,"And if you could talk a little bit about, if my recollection is correct that there is a Preapproval process, if you can talk about that as well.",162,,
957,0.97,5480.975,5483.144,"Sure, Councilmember Herbold, thank you.",163,,
958,0.97,5483.144,5489.55,The Crf money is direct aid where it specifies in the Federal legislation what it can be spent on.,163,,
959,0.97,5489.55,5509.27,"It is really, that money, council passes to accept it and as long as we spend it according to the directives and the cares act, the Coronavirus assistant or recovery act, I think is what that Acronym stands for, but as long as we spend the money according to the provisions, we're good.",163,,
960,0.97,5509.27,5525.286,"As far as FEMA, I am not specifically aware that there was a Preapproval for those, but that would be the type of program where if there was Preapproval process, you could stipulate it and set it up.",163,,
961,0.97,5525.286,5536.53,"However, even if that were the case, that would not take away our responsibility to come up with the money on the front end and then submit reimbursement for it later.",163,,
962,0.97,5536.53,5545.306,Then it would be whether or not the reimbursement application would fit within the Preapproval guidelines.,163,,
963,0.97,5545.306,5558.386,"I'm not specifically aware, and there probably is a greater level SP Efkecificity.",163,,
964,0.97,5558.386,5576.137,"I was doing some of my research, which I did, we did ask Jeff a similar question and Jeff, I think you might have a little Intel into that to compliment what Tom has said and I see Councilmember Lewis as well.",164,,
965,0.97,5576.137,5584.946,"So the Preapproval process for FEMA is limited to, at least to my knowledge it is limited to two Noncongregate options.",165,,
966,0.97,5584.946,5586.614,They picture there is a disaster like a hurricane.,165,,
967,0.97,5586.614,5597.959,"You need to house a lot of people like homes are destroyed, moving them into a congregate facility, cheapest and most efficient is the Pathway they would look for a municipality to use, for example.",165,,
968,0.97,5597.959,5602.43,"Obviously because of the nature of Covid-19, not the ideal response.",165,,
969,0.97,5602.43,5610.972,My understanding is now that FEMA is not Reimbursing for congregate shelter programs.,165,,
970,0.97,5610.972,5613.774,They're only Reimbursing for Noncongregate.,165,,
971,0.97,5613.774,5623.117,"Noncongregate for any FEMA reimbursements, the emergency declaration or others, Preapproval is needed.",165,,
972,0.97,5623.117,5632.727,We need to provide certain information and we would receive back approval for doing that project before being eligible to receive any reimbursement.,165,,
973,0.97,5632.727,5636.831,"We couldn't begin the project, ask for Preapproval and then try to Backtrack.",165,,
974,0.97,5636.831,5639.834,It does have to be received first.,165,,
975,0.97,5639.834,5645.106,"Last year, actually, I don't know the date of the Preapproval.",165,,
976,0.97,5645.106,5657.618,"I do know we sought Preapproval for the expansion of Union village, recreation at TC Crawfordsvilleage, Lakefront house, near bitter Lake.",165,,
977,0.97,5657.618,5671.599,"They're all three Noncongregate shelter programs and they were intended to respond to the pandemic and then also, the hotel that was provided for first responders and eventually emergency personnel.",165,,
978,0.97,5671.599,5679.573,The approval was limited at the time to the first responders who would not have the ability to return home immediately.,165,,
979,0.97,5679.573,5683.978,"A family member, especially high-risk, if they return, they would expose their family and things like that.",165,,
980,0.97,5683.978,5690.384,We did receive approval for it and I'm not aware of any other approvals at this time.,165,,
981,0.97,5690.384,5690.718,Thank you.,166,,
982,0.97,5690.718,5694.922,"Councilmember Lewis, did you have a question as well?",167,,
983,0.97,5694.922,5709.17,"Thank you, Councilmember Mosqueda, and my first question is on the next agenda item, because it seems like we're sort of bleeding a little bit into the next agenda item, will we be joined by folks from the executive --",168,,
984,0.97,5709.17,5709.603,"Yes, we will.",169,,
985,0.97,5709.603,5709.97,"Okay, great.",170,,
986,0.97,5709.97,5714.442,I just want to note to hold some of the questions for them.,170,,
987,0.97,5714.442,5742.236,"I just want to jump in here to clarify maybe from our central staff folks, whoever wants to take this, there has obviously been a lot of discussion in the media based on reporting about sort of what is and isn't eligible for reimbursement around the services that are attached to some of these Noncongregate shelter options.",170,,
988,0.97,5742.236,5761.889,I wonder if we could get an assessment from central staff on really what the dividing lines on that are in terms of what is and isn't Reimbursable to set that straight for the Council and for the public based on the work you have done looking into this.,170,,
989,0.97,5761.889,5768.529,Is it okay if I take that one?,171,,
990,0.97,5768.529,5768.762,Sure.,172,,
991,0.97,5768.762,5769.029,Go ahead.,172,,
992,0.97,5769.029,5769.43,Thank you.,173,,
993,0.97,5769.43,5777.605,So I'm going to give an inadequate answer to your question because there are areas that we don't have strong insight.,174,,
994,0.97,5777.605,5783.511,"For example, FEMA has been clear, even if you look at, for example, what was approved for Los Angeles.",174,,
995,0.97,5783.511,5788.616,"The project room key, that support services and case management services are not eligible for reimbursement.",174,,
996,0.97,5788.616,5791.519,That goes back again to how FEMA was envisioned.,174,,
997,0.97,5791.519,5800.494,They were looking at a situation where someone's home is destroyed by a hurricane.,174,,
998,0.97,5800.494,5806.767,You put them somewhere temporarily so they can sort out their things and return to their spot.,174,,
999,0.97,5806.767,5826.887,"It was not envisioned as a way to respond to, in our case, not only the needs of allowing social isolation for those at heightened risk of Covid-19 but also those experiencing homelessness.",174,,
1000,0.97,5826.887,5828.055,Those are not admissible.,174,,
1001,0.97,5828.055,5839.934,Required staffing may be categorized as case management or some sort of service rather than the essential actions that are necessary to make that Noncongregate approach possible.,174,,
1002,0.97,5839.934,5860.287,"For example, if you're thinking about putting a large number of people that have been experiencing unsheltered homelessness into a hotel, just leaving them there without any interactions and dropping a meal off every now and then may or may not be the most efficient or safe or considerate or efficient way of operating.",174,,
1003,0.97,5860.287,5871.465,"It may be useful to have some people coordinating some of the interactions that you may need people on site managing when things are provided to ensure that social isolation is happening, and things like.",174,,
1004,0.97,5871.465,5883.944,That it is just not clear to my knowledge at this point that we have gotten clear guidance from FEMA on what would be categorized.,174,,
1005,0.97,5883.944,5895.723,"Talking with Cvo, there is a general perception that we need to assume that we're not--that we should proceed assuming that FEMA will be restrictive in what we will approve.",174,,
1006,0.97,5895.723,5896.557,That is a Nonissue.,174,,
1007,0.97,5896.557,5904.164,"With all of the costs, we're doing them because they're seen as the essential services that they're necessary to make that possible.",174,,
1008,0.97,5904.164,5906.8,Hopefully that is some insight into your question.,174,,
1009,0.97,5906.8,5907.468,I can't fully answer it.,174,,
1010,0.97,5907.468,5910.871,"Can I just do a quick follow up, Madame chair?",175,,
1011,0.97,5910.871,5916.443,"Yes, and I will note, we have the next hour for the two items.",176,,
1012,0.97,5916.443,5925.219,"As Councilmember Lewis mentioned, this is a good, sort of touch point for the conversation we will have but do a follow up and we'll move on.",176,,
1013,0.97,5925.219,5930.257,I think this is all encompassed in the two items left on our agenda.,176,,
1014,0.97,5930.257,5937.564,We'll have a chance to talk more about Noncongregate shelters specifically coming up on agenda number 4.,176,,
1015,0.97,5937.564,5939.199,"How about this, then, Madame chair?",177,,
1016,0.97,5939.199,5941.802,I think it is kind of related to the fourth item.,177,,
1017,0.97,5941.802,5950.01,"Jeff, why don't I just ask the question and you book mark it and then save it for your remarks when we go to the item four.",177,,
1018,0.97,5950.01,5952.746,If we can just get an idea.,177,,
1019,0.97,5952.746,5967.561,"I'm just curing when, like, the handful of sand becomes a pile of sand on, like, when a service transitions to being, you know, something to just operate a congregate shelter, to being an essential service.",177,,
1020,0.97,5967.561,5977.338,"For Exaple, you know, someone manning the front desk and handing out towels I guess; essential to managing the shelter.",177,,
1021,0.97,5977.338,5982.943,"If people are doing referrals to, like, Opioid inhibitors, that is clearly case management.",177,,
1022,0.97,5982.943,5985.145,I think maybe just an explanation.,177,,
1023,0.97,5985.145,6004.365,"I understand that it requires more FEMA guidance but maybe, like, to the best extent that we can, do an assessment of when does it bleed over to something that is more is an essential question for the public and for our discussion between Council and the executive on the fourth item.",177,,
1024,0.97,6004.365,6007.301,I want to book mark that for when we move on.,177,,
1025,0.97,6007.301,6013.574,"So thanks, Madame chair, for letting me get out there when it is fresh in my mind.",177,,
1026,0.97,6013.574,6014.007,Appreciate it.,178,,
1027,0.97,6014.007,6020.314,And it is challenging to Dissect the conversations.,178,,
1028,0.97,6020.314,6034.595,I think we're good to move on and thank you for the distinction on grants versus expenditures.,178,,
1029,0.97,6034.595,6035.796,Are we on mute here?,179,,
1030,0.97,6035.796,6035.996,Okay.,179,,
1031,0.97,6035.996,6065.225,"So just, I guess, to wrap up, the city's response to the Coronavirus, Covid emergency, includes a mix of direct aid that we'll cover in the next few slides, fee Reimbursable expense, which will be part of the presentation, and then use of existing City resources to fill in gaps and to adjust for the economic impacts of the emergency.",179,,
1032,0.97,6065.225,6081.108,"Pivoting to the Coronavirus relief funds, which I'll call Crf from now on, the July 2020 meeting of the select budget committee, executive provided an over view of the city's Covid response so far.",179,,
1033,0.97,6081.108,6105.065,"The proposed use of the moneys from Crf moneys, totaling $131 million that were made available in the Federal Coronavirus aid relief and economic security act or the cares act, these are so far, the largest source of direct aid that the city has received to respond to this emergency so far.",179,,
1034,0.97,6105.065,6115.843,This table here takes a lot of detail provided by the city budget office and Categorizes it down by broad spending category.,179,,
1035,0.97,6115.843,6128.255,It shows the 2020 original plan that was shown to the select budget committee in July of last year.,179,,
1036,0.97,6128.255,6137.498,"Some revised estimates that the executive derived in the fall, Restrategizing some of the funds and I'll cover that where the largest changes are.",179,,
1037,0.97,6137.498,6143.403,The 2020 actual spending and the 2020 remaining amount.,179,,
1038,0.97,6143.403,6151.245,"This will be a familiar amount, the bottom line total in the right hand corner, the $28 million.",179,,
1039,0.97,6151.245,6158.318,This is basically the Crf dollars from 2020 that were not spent that will roll into 2021.,179,,
1040,0.97,6158.318,6161.054,The biggest chunk of this is reserves.,179,,
1041,0.97,6161.054,6185.712,"It is slightly higher than the $17.2 million figure that was shared with the committee two weeks ago and this is largely due to the reconciliation process from city-wide accounting, essentially figuring out what remained unspent and where it should have been categorized and that was a beneficial adjustment to the reserves.",179,,
1042,0.97,6185.712,6195.656,The other pieces in all of the various rows above the $18 million in the Crf reserves grow.,179,,
1043,0.97,6195.656,6208.669,"They indicated that though they have rolled into 20121, they will be spent by February.",179,,
1044,0.97,6208.669,6213.874,This is the plan and where the aid was deployed.,179,,
1045,0.97,6213.874,6216.61,So if we just look at the --,179,,
1046,0.97,6216.61,6217.377,"Oh, so sorry, Tom.",180,,
1047,0.97,6217.377,6219.313,I just want to say thank you.,180,,
1048,0.97,6219.313,6228.388,I know this took a lot of work to really Dissect the information and provide it in the type of graph that is easy to read.,180,,
1049,0.97,6228.388,6236.897,I appreciate all of the work that you did to pull this together for the Council's benefit and do the side by side comparisons is very important.,180,,
1050,0.97,6236.897,6242.235,Appreciate all of that time and energy that it took.,180,,
1051,0.97,6242.235,6243.537,Happy to do so.,181,,
1052,0.97,6243.537,6256.55,"As Aly mentioned there, will be a memo from staff later in the week that actually has greater detail than this.",181,,
1053,0.97,6256.55,6258.952,This is part of the table that will be forth coming.,181,,
1054,0.97,6258.952,6272.065,"If we can move to the next slide, Aly, I'll talk about the major places where the plan changed, just for visibility for the fines and housing committee.",181,,
1055,0.97,6272.065,6283.343,"In the maintain city services and support employees category, there was approximately a 4 million, $4.5 million shift, so this is a function of a couple of different things.",181,,
1056,0.97,6283.343,6292.419,"One, there was an originally $10 million allocation to the Department of finance and administrative services for reopening costs.",181,,
1057,0.97,6292.419,6298.692,"So those reopening, unfortunately, did not occur last year, could not occur.",181,,
1058,0.97,6298.692,6322.716,"The emergency is still present, so there was a decision made to shift those moneys to other places, particularly given that at the time there was a sense, not a sense, there was, the firm knowledge that the Crf moneys would not be available for spending after the end of the year.",181,,
1059,0.97,6322.716,6332.025,That subsequently changed late in December but these plan shifts were made with that pending deadline in sight.,181,,
1060,0.97,6332.025,6344.137,"The $10 million for reopening was decreased to the $633,000 they had spent and then there were increased allocations made for emergency, labor and Teleworking support.",181,,
1061,0.97,6344.137,6360.354,"A lot of city staff had shifted to Telework, so that basically funds a portion of that and then also, the emergency labor is logistics that operate the Covid supply warehouse.",181,,
1062,0.97,6360.354,6367.394,That explains that shift in that broad category of maintaining city services.,181,,
1063,0.97,6367.394,6375.936,"Next, responding to emergency Covid-19 impacts, so the original plan had a $3.1 million for that line.",181,,
1064,0.97,6375.936,6390.751,"Subsequent to the plan in the summer, Crf, or the FEMA guidance indicated that first Responder, hotels and first responders wouldn't be eligible for future reimbursements.",181,,
1065,0.97,6390.751,6410.237,"There was a shift in the plan, in light of the fact that it was a Reimbursable expense, would bring the cost down and the total cost spent on the category of spending in the entire city response plan was lower.",181,,
1066,0.97,6410.237,6413.84,"Moving down, supporting essential household community needs priority area.",181,,
1067,0.97,6413.84,6424.751,"The external help for the community, there was a shift in the food security allocation from $3 million to 1.9 million.",181,,
1068,0.97,6424.751,6440.934,"Again, this was a strategy to ensure that the, at the time, Ncrf moneys were spent by the year end deadline and the executive allocated a million dollars to rental assistance as a use of Crf moneys in the plan.",181,,
1069,0.97,6440.934,6446.706,They were spent for that purpose based on information sent.,181,,
1070,0.97,6446.706,6450.61,That was the shift in the plan for that category.,181,,
1071,0.97,6450.61,6455.148,"And then Finally, the largest amount is, again, the reserves.",181,,
1072,0.97,6455.148,6472.799,"At the time there was, I believe, it was communicated a couple of weeks ago, an amount held for meet expenses potentially not FEMA Reimbursable and ultimately it was determined that the money had been needed in 2020 for that amount.",181,,
1073,0.97,6472.799,6481.208,"It is retained now in city accounts, though I believe it does need to be spent by the year end.",181,,
1074,0.97,6481.208,6487.581,It is the largest portion of remaining Crf moneys.,181,,
1075,0.97,6487.581,6491.418,I think that is the extent of the Crf money.,181,,
1076,0.97,6491.418,6493.753,We can pause if there are questions.,181,,
1077,0.97,6493.753,6494.354,That sounds good.,182,,
1078,0.97,6494.354,6497.49,I think there are a few questions.,182,,
1079,0.97,6497.49,6507.434,"Just very briefly to Orient myself and colleagues, when did we learn about the changes in the allocated amount versus what was actually spent?",182,,
1080,0.97,6507.434,6520.413,"It is quite a big shift, obviously in the amount of money for additional maintenance for city service and support for housing for folks.",182,,
1081,0.97,6520.413,6528.688,When did the change in the dollar amount for allocation get notified to the Council?,182,,
1082,0.97,6528.688,6537.864,"Chair Mosqueda, so on Friday we received the updated information in the context of the entire plan.",183,,
1083,0.97,6537.864,6543.27,That was when it became apparent where all of the additional shifts were made.,183,,
1084,0.97,6543.27,6553.113,I believe there was some portion of this that took place in the third quarter supplemental but not the entirety of it.,183,,
1085,0.97,6553.113,6557.217,It was a mixture between the two.,183,,
1086,0.97,6557.217,6571.064,"I'm not aware of the full presentation, similar to the one that accompanied July Covid spending proposal to the select budget committee.",183,,
1087,0.97,6571.064,6571.498,Last Friday.,184,,
1088,0.97,6571.498,6572.232,Okay.,184,,
1089,0.97,6572.232,6573.7,"Councilmember Herbold, vice chair, please go ahead.",184,,
1090,0.97,6573.7,6577.704,Thank you so much.,185,,
1091,0.97,6577.704,6585.946,I'm a little confused by the second bullet related to the hotel first responders allocation.,185,,
1092,0.97,6585.946,6599.526,My recollection was that the city has spent about 3.9 million on rooms for quarantine and isolation first responders at the executive Pacific.,185,,
1093,0.97,6599.526,6605.899,"My recollection was that the dollars we were spending, we expected FEMA reimbursement.",185,,
1094,0.97,6605.899,6611.338,Did we pay for it out of Non-Crf funds?,185,,
1095,0.97,6611.338,6616.71,"And if so, what is the funding source, if that is what we ended up doing?",185,,
1096,0.97,6616.71,6618.278,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",186,,
1097,0.97,6618.278,6632.959,"So when we moved, actually, to the next few slides for the reimbursement, there was an element of this demonstrating that there was actually a higher FEMA reimbursement request made for that purpose.",186,,
1098,0.97,6632.959,6635.228,It is not the $3.1 million.,186,,
1099,0.97,6635.228,6636.93,It is a lower number than that.,186,,
1100,0.97,6636.93,6643.837,I would have to do more research to tie those two numbers out.,186,,
1101,0.97,6643.837,6657.117,"As far as the original city fund that is supporting the costs in the interim, I have to check back with the executive to get the specific details.",186,,
1102,0.97,6657.117,6673.366,Just to say future slides will show some element of that and how the explanation of shifting from relying largely on Crf toward relying on FEMA reimbursement does bear itself out through the analysis of the data that we received.,186,,
1103,0.97,6673.366,6681.074,I can add a little bit more for Councilmember Herbold.,187,,
1104,0.97,6681.074,6688.748,"I know that, I have to double check the expenditures but I do know that, again, we have to have Preapproval for the project.",187,,
1105,0.97,6688.748,6692.786,It was one of the ones we received Preapproval for.,187,,
1106,0.97,6692.786,6695.255,It was Preapproved for first responders.,187,,
1107,0.97,6695.255,6718.578,"The expansion to serving essential personnel was not considered something--it was assumed to be something we would not be Preapproved for and therefore, not sending in a request for FEMA reimbursement for those costs and they be incurred by the state.",187,,
1108,0.97,6718.578,6735.361,"I'm still struggling with that, you know, as I have mentioned before, I sort of, because we were receiving this information from CBO, I sort of monitored the use of the hotel rooms.",188,,
1109,0.97,6735.361,6743.536,There wasn't a day when there was more than 20 of those rooms being used.,188,,
1110,0.97,6743.536,6757.383,"We paid for much, much more than we used under the assumption we would be using them for first responders.",188,,
1111,0.97,6757.383,6769.229,"It may be true that a few rooms here or there would be used for someone other than first responders, but we paid for much, much more than we actually used.",188,,
1112,0.97,6769.229,6784.41,"I think the capacity was something like 251 rooms and like I said, on any given night, I don't believe there was more than 20 rooms being used.",188,,
1113,0.97,6784.41,6806.966,"I'm still very confused about how we determine that--and perhaps we simply are only being reimbursed for the rooms that we actually are able to use, and so the rest of the cost associated with the unused rooms, we don't get to be reimbursed.",188,,
1114,0.97,6806.966,6816.442,That is another question that I have that I haven't been able to get an answer to.,188,,
1115,0.97,6816.442,6827.654,"Do we actually have information on what reimbursement we're seeking for these rooms, the number of dollars?",188,,
1116,0.97,6827.654,6828.588,?,188,,
1117,0.97,6828.588,6833.893,"I think that a large part of your questions, I'll have to get back to you on.",189,,
1118,0.97,6833.893,6849.309,My recollection from the fall is Seattle is not the only municipality that faced the situation where obtaining a hotel at the time required leasing the entire block rather than just getting a per room rate.,189,,
1119,0.97,6849.309,6862.488,I am not familiar enough with the subsequent guidance from FEMA on how to handle that on getting a on Yay or nay we're able to get a statement.,189,,
1120,0.97,6862.488,6885.044,"That would have some bearing on the response and there is the separate piece that if some rooms were then used for some purpose that was not Preapproved th would affect what is the Prected FEMA request for reimbursements and so I'll have to, as I said, I'll look at the spread sheets but probably will have to get back to you on it.",189,,
1121,0.97,6885.044,6886.279,Thank you.,190,,
1122,0.97,6886.279,6890.617,"Councilmember, if I could just add, maybe Tom said this but I want to restate.",190,,
1123,0.97,6890.617,6912.905,"I think what we understand from CBO is that FEMA eligibility guidance changed so we're reducing reliance on the Crf funds to support the services but as Jeff and Tom both eluded to, we'll need time sort out exactly where on the chart that I have up on the screen, all of the different costs are falling.",190,,
1124,0.97,6912.905,6922.448,"Then, if I could just add to chair Mosqueda's question about when we knew about the shifts, as Tom said, some came through in the third quarter.",190,,
1125,0.97,6922.448,6924.751,Some of it in the fourth quarter.,190,,
1126,0.97,6924.751,6944.504,"To be really Frank about it, by the time you get to the fourth quarter supplemental it was a very quick turn around in terms of the Council's consideration of the legislation and the central staff didn't have an opportunity to fully compile all of that information to present it in this way to compare against the original plan.",190,,
1127,0.97,6944.504,6973.599,"I think we have now provided this update and can work with CBO on better methods for providing more timely information to Council in a format that is more consistent with how we're presenting the data today so that we're all sort of on the same page, so acknowledging that we may have not summarized in in this way at the end of November, beginning of December.",190,,
1128,0.97,6973.599,6975.635,"Thank you very much, Aly.",191,,
1129,0.97,6975.635,6976.135,No apologies necessary.,191,,
1130,0.97,6976.135,6978.471,I know it takes a lot of time to get this.,191,,
1131,0.97,6978.471,6993.152,"I appreciate what you also mentioned and happy to join conversations about, you know, a format or template that can help make sure the information is easily digestible and helps everyone make sure we're comparing apples to apples.",191,,
1132,0.97,6993.152,6995.621,That will be a helpful format going forward.,191,,
1133,0.97,6995.621,7006.432,I also appreciate that you included the total for the 2020S Actuals in the chart so we can do the 2020 plan compared to 2020 Actuals total.,191,,
1134,0.97,7006.432,7007.567,Thank you for adding that in.,191,,
1135,0.97,7007.567,7019.379,"We have quite a bit to go through, folks and I want to make sure we get through the presentation and get a chance to have eyes on the resolution before we wrap up.",191,,
1136,0.97,7019.379,7024.05,"Please go ahead, Tom.",191,,
1137,0.97,7024.05,7024.851,"Thank you, chair Mosqueda.",192,,
1138,0.97,7024.851,7033.059,"Just again, cite there will be a memo forth coming that there have details on the items.",192,,
1139,0.97,7033.059,7055.882,"Councilmember Herbold's question about the hotel is covered in the first line of this particular table, so what this represents is a look at the original FEMA reimbursement plan with Leveraging Crf funds as a match and the FEMA request and total amount and then comparing that with the Actuals that we know so far.",192,,
1140,0.97,7055.882,7066.159,"Then in the public safety and first responders here at the top, the FEMA request line generally matches both the request and plan.",192,,
1141,0.97,7066.159,7076.436,That is actually a function of a couple of things.,192,,
1142,0.97,7076.436,7080.44,"There was a reduction or actually, maybe I'm mixing things up.",192,,
1143,0.97,7080.44,7105.531,"Largely what this does is shifts money that was originally going to be requested for Ppe towards hotel and expenses instead and so there was lower expenditure for Ppe but because of the shift in FEMA eligibility of funds, the original plan for first responders was $244,000.",192,,
1144,0.97,7105.531,7109.936,Now the city is requesting reimbursement of $1.9 million.,192,,
1145,0.97,7109.936,7119.645,There was actually that--that bears out the shift from just relying on the Crf funds toward using city funds and requesting for reimbursement.,192,,
1146,0.97,7119.645,7133.593,"It is a fairly detailed table that will be in the memo that we'll draw some of this stuff out given the time that we have on the committee today, this is just a high level review.",192,,
1147,0.97,7133.593,7154.08,"Also, if we can stay on this slide a bit, just looking at the shifts for protecting our most vulnerable neighbors, the original FEMA request was Inintended to be around $7 million and it turned out to be $3.5 million because of a number of two things.",192,,
1148,0.97,7154.08,7158.651,"One, the original request for congregate shelter was to be $3.2 million.",192,,
1149,0.97,7158.651,7166.425,Instead it is actually going to be 1.7 million.,192,,
1150,0.97,7166.425,7170.53,This is because FEMA changed the eligibility criteria.,192,,
1151,0.97,7170.53,7175.768,Congregate shelter is no longer FEMA eligible for reimbursement.,192,,
1152,0.97,7175.768,7184.443,"For Noncongregate shelter, the original plan was to request reimbursement for $1.9 million Úand the actual request was 200,000.",192,,
1153,0.97,7184.443,7198.357,"Cbo was aware of additional costs, that may serve to bring the total higher, this is just the amount that has been requested thus far.",192,,
1154,0.97,7198.357,7203.896,"Responding to emergency Covid-19 impacts, there is the original FEMA request in the plan of 6.6 million.",192,,
1155,0.97,7203.896,7211.704,Actual request is more in the order of 2.1.,192,,
1156,0.97,7211.704,7214.207,This is largely a function of timing.,192,,
1157,0.97,7214.207,7229.388,They indicated that the state advised the city to break up the projects within certain Timeframes and so the amount that has been requested so far represents what has occurred through September 23rd of 2020.,192,,
1158,0.97,7229.388,7242.668,The indication there is there will be additional expense that will beef up the actual request that gets made of FEMA.,192,,
1159,0.97,7242.668,7244.537,"Finally, supporting households and community needs.",192,,
1160,0.97,7244.537,7258.117,"The original plan had around 7.4 million and as you'll see, the actual request is only on the order of $564,000.",192,,
1161,0.97,7258.117,7282.541,"The largest Variants here, according to CBO, is a significant chunk of the request was for food banks and food assistance and their indication, again, is that the state ended up picking up the costs and so it is not a matter of that the city is even incurring the expense.",192,,
1162,0.97,7282.541,7286.145,It is being born by the state.,192,,
1163,0.97,7286.145,7297.59,"Again, I won't say it any further but there will be a more detailed table for the categories within the individual lines that will accompany the memo that is forth coming.",192,,
1164,0.97,7297.59,7298.324,Appreciate.,193,,
1165,0.97,7298.324,7301.26,"That vice chair Herbold, go ahead.",193,,
1166,0.97,7301.26,7301.627,Thank you.,194,,
1167,0.97,7301.627,7318.577,"It is my understanding that, as you describe the situation for food assistance, Tom, for 2020, that that is the case that the funding was picked up by the state.",194,,
1168,0.97,7318.577,7346.005,"My understanding is that it created a funding cliff and so the agencies receiving funding that are providing food assistance are Prespending on their 2021 grants, which is going to create, you know, an eventual deficit in 2021 for their services.",194,,
1169,0.97,7346.005,7375.634,"So I'm interested to know whether or not a future FEMA request might be used to address that because, again, you know, we have created a short-term solution that creates I think, a long-term problem for the agencies that provide these life saving food services.",194,,
1170,0.97,7375.634,7381.607,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",195,,
1171,0.97,7381.607,7384.643,I don't know the specificity of the financials behind that.,195,,
1172,0.97,7384.643,7411.437,"Later on in the presentation we'll talk about the aid that is actually in the 2021 adopted budget, though I'm aware that the resolution does include this component of aid as well as one of the topics to consider, particularly with regards to the $221 million that I'll talk about here in a bit about in the pending Federal aid.",195,,
1173,0.97,7411.437,7426.418,"Other than that, I would have to follow up with the executive and central staff to find out the specific details about the potential funding cliff.",195,,
1174,0.97,7426.418,7428.387,"Go ahead, Aly.",196,,
1175,0.97,7428.387,7431.09,"Thank you, chair Mosqueda, Councilmember Herbold.",197,,
1176,0.97,7431.09,7448.274,"My understanding, and I think the director mentioned this in the previous committee meeting but to some extent, that the funding cliff, the Pre-Spending on the 2021 contracts with the city is some what of a risk assuming that we will receive additional Federal funds.",197,,
1177,0.97,7448.274,7465.758,I think the expectation is that some of the anticipated Federal money that the city will receive will be used to ensure that the funding extends through the end of the year.,197,,
1178,0.97,7465.758,7474.4,I believe CBO is continues to look at expenditures and those kinds of things and continuing to follow FEMA guidance as it changes.,197,,
1179,0.97,7474.4,7482.441,It is possible that certain expenditures may be eligible for FEMA.,197,,
1180,0.97,7482.441,7492.985,I think the plan is additional funding will come one way or another to ensure the services don't fall off the cliff in June.,197,,
1181,0.97,7492.985,7493.853,Thank you very much.,198,,
1182,0.97,7493.853,7494.587,Councilmember Lewis.,198,,
1183,0.97,7494.587,7496.488,Any quick question before we continue?,198,,
1184,0.97,7496.488,7497.356,Thank you so much.,199,,
1185,0.97,7497.356,7507.933,"I just want to zero in a little bit here on the reimbursement for the tiny House villages, which might be instructive to some other discussions that we're having.",199,,
1186,0.97,7507.933,7518.544,"Is reimbursement being sought for services and if so, what are the nature of the services Preapproved and sought for the tiny houses?",199,,
1187,0.97,7518.544,7520.579,I do not know the answer to that.,200,,
1188,0.97,7520.579,7528.22,I would have to get back to you on what specific things are or not being requested for reimbursement.,200,,
1189,0.97,7528.22,7535.594,We didn't get the numbers far enough in advance that we could Delve into the amounts.,200,,
1190,0.97,7535.594,7542.701,I have that noted as a good example that may give us insight for potential expenditures.,200,,
1191,0.97,7542.701,7543.068,"Thanks, Jeff.",201,,
1192,0.97,7543.068,7550.676,Is that a master list of questions you're compiling that we can kind of look at before we get sent off?,202,,
1193,0.97,7550.676,7550.876,Great.,202,,
1194,0.97,7550.876,7551.377,I saw some nods.,202,,
1195,0.97,7551.377,7555.948,I know we already noted that the meeting would go a little bit over today.,202,,
1196,0.97,7555.948,7561.086,I'm hoping there may be flexibility so we'll keep plowing through the presentation.,202,,
1197,0.97,7561.086,7572.831,This is really important and very timely considering that Congress is poised to potentially pass this on the 14th Tbd on the actual date.,202,,
1198,0.97,7572.831,7581.607,We want to make sure we get a chance to get through this today.,202,,
1199,0.97,7581.607,7582.608,"Thank you, keep going.",202,,
1200,0.97,7582.608,7598.924,"Next slide we'll wrap up the high level of FEMA reimbursement this is reiterating the high level analysis provided a couple of weeks ago, so far pending an actual request, our total of $13.5 million.",203,,
1201,0.97,7598.924,7605.531,"The city continues to work to increase that number, but that is what we are aware of so far.",203,,
1202,0.97,7605.531,7611.337,"Of that amount, 4.3 million has actually been submitted and 9.2 is being prepared.",203,,
1203,0.97,7611.337,7619.778,"If we can go to the next slide, we'll move to what--what is in the 2021 budget so far for continuing Covid relief.",203,,
1204,0.97,7619.778,7626.218,These are items that are in the existing budget lines as passed by critical.,203,,
1205,0.97,7626.218,7634.46,There are $23.5 million for shelter and providing housing for people experiencing homelessness.,203,,
1206,0.97,7634.46,7645.337,"$2 million for expansion of Noncongregate shelter, particularly in hotels, $8 million for rental assistance and Eviction protection.",203,,
1207,0.97,7645.337,7649.808,5.8 million for emergency shelter providers.,203,,
1208,0.97,7649.808,7658.784,2.7 million for 125 new shelter beds.,203,,
1209,0.97,7658.784,7661.453,Next slide.,203,,
1210,0.97,7661.453,7664.423,350 more mortgage counseling services.,203,,
1211,0.97,7664.423,7667.092,$6.3 million for the public hygiene program.,203,,
1212,0.97,7667.092,7670.362,3 million for small business stabilization.,203,,
1213,0.97,7670.362,7676.268,3.4 for emergency grocery vouchers and then 5 million for Covid tests and costs at city departments.,203,,
1214,0.97,7676.268,7678.637,This totals $60 million in public assistance.,203,,
1215,0.97,7678.637,7682.808,That is included in the budget right now.,203,,
1216,0.97,7682.808,7694.353,"I just would note that it doesn't include, it doesn't include costs that the city has will that will incur on the part of first responders.",203,,
1217,0.97,7694.353,7704.963,These are already budgeted in the emergency response lines of another organizational measures that may be necessary as the city responds to the emergency.,203,,
1218,0.97,7704.963,7712.171,"So slide 7 and 8, you said, totalled $60 million already in the budget.",204,,
1219,0.97,7712.171,7712.604,That is correct.,205,,
1220,0.97,7712.604,7712.905,Correct.,206,,
1221,0.97,7712.905,7735.661,"And is it accurate then to say if you look at the first portion of this presentation, slide 7, 2.3 million for shelter and providing shelter to those providing homelessness, 2 million to expand congregate shelters we have Prioritized for hotels and 5.8 to provide emergency support providers as they increase costs.",207,,
1222,0.97,7735.661,7744.103,Half of that is for those experiencing homelessness and trying to provide additional sheltering options.,207,,
1223,0.97,7744.103,7745.237,At best.,208,,
1224,0.97,7745.237,7746.572,That sounds about right.,208,,
1225,0.97,7746.572,7749.341,"And in fact, it is probably more than half, Yeah.",208,,
1226,0.97,7749.341,7755.914,I think it is part of the follow up to the questions that we're going to be collecting.,209,,
1227,0.97,7755.914,7765.991,This may be related to Councilmember Lewis' questions having a better understanding of the line items that go within the portion of the half of the 60 million will be helpful as we respond to some of the questions we perceived.,209,,
1228,0.97,7765.991,7768.494,Don't expect you all to know that right now.,209,,
1229,0.97,7768.494,7777.035,I know that is something that we'll continue to glean from our discussions.,209,,
1230,0.97,7777.035,7780.005,Now we'll talk briefly --,210,,
1231,0.97,7780.005,7783.842,"Councilmember Strauss, please go ahead.",211,,
1232,0.97,7783.842,7785.811,"Thank you, chair Mosqueda.",212,,
1233,0.97,7785.811,7790.849,I have withheld my questions on the interest of time.,212,,
1234,0.97,7790.849,7792.217,I know we're short on time.,212,,
1235,0.97,7792.217,7810.435,"You have asked many of the questions I have been so interested to know the answers to, whether it is about what is the delay in hotel and what our services that we can provide as, you know, providing the basic shelter or if it is defined as addressing homelessness at large.",212,,
1236,0.97,7810.435,7813.705,I just have kind of two questions amongst this entire presentation.,212,,
1237,0.97,7813.705,7816.475,I have wanted to get it in before the Buzzer.,212,,
1238,0.97,7816.475,7820.779,"I want to clarify that, can I, as a Councilmember, expend dollars?",212,,
1239,0.97,7820.779,7828.987,I believe the answer is no but I wanted to have that on the record.,212,,
1240,0.97,7828.987,7829.221,No.,213,,
1241,0.97,7829.221,7829.788,You can authorize spending.,213,,
1242,0.97,7829.788,7830.055,Great.,214,,
1243,0.97,7830.055,7833.292,That may be a follow up question that I have later.,214,,
1244,0.97,7833.292,7843.268,"You know, I asked that question just to demonstrate that even if I, as a Councilmember, wanted to house everyone that is homeless in my district, I could not do so.",214,,
1245,0.97,7843.268,7846.805,"I could authorize it, but I could not do it.",214,,
1246,0.97,7846.805,7857.182,"Then I wanted to highlight the risk is that, the risk that we incur with the FEMA reimbursement is the risk of Timeline with reimbursement.",214,,
1247,0.97,7857.182,7861.787,Not the risk of whether or not we will be reimbursed.,214,,
1248,0.97,7861.787,7863.488,Is that a correct understanding?,214,,
1249,0.97,7863.488,7868.36,"Councilmember Strauss, thank you for the question.",215,,
1250,0.97,7868.36,7882.474,The Timeline isn't so much a risk as a function of the band Wi it Dth of the program to give out the funds.,215,,
1251,0.97,7882.474,7895.687,The risk with eligibility is whether or not the record keeping of the city and the way the application is processed meets the specific requirements for the reimbursement.,215,,
1252,0.97,7895.687,7900.058,"If records were not kept appropriately, there would be a risk that we wouldn't get reimbursed.",215,,
1253,0.97,7900.058,7915.641,"We make an application but there is no guarantee that we would receive the moneys, but if we are spending within the guidelines that are given to us at the time for the reimbursement program, that helps.",215,,
1254,0.97,7915.641,7929.521,"It is not that we're meeting those are crossing our our t's and dotting our I's, that mitigates the risk to some extent.",215,,
1255,0.97,7929.521,7940.499,"I hope that provides more detail about kind of the ways that, I guess, the risk for the filing of FEMA moneys plays out.",215,,
1256,0.97,7940.499,7947.606,"It does, Tom, I was trying to put myself in the director's shoes in regards with risk.",216,,
1257,0.97,7947.606,7955.247,"What is the available cash on hand and I trust director noble so much, which is why I ask that question about the risk and Timeline.",216,,
1258,0.97,7955.247,7972.564,I think it is important for us to keep that in mind because he has done a good job of keeping our city budget in mind and I trust him well enough to keep the appropriate records to receive the reimbursement.,216,,
1259,0.97,7972.564,7979.204,I will probably ask him to clarify if it is his office or another office that is required to keep the detailed record Keping.,216,,
1260,0.97,7979.204,7983.175,The last point is to highlight what chair Mosqueda mentioned about budgeting.,216,,
1261,0.97,7983.175,7990.816,"We know that in times like this, we, as the government, need to be spending money to keep the economy rolling.",216,,
1262,0.97,7990.816,8009.434,"It is a different understanding than typical for profit business which has a very clear budgeting resource, profits and losses need to be managed in a different way for a for profit company than for a public entity such as the government.",216,,
1263,0.97,8009.434,8019.845,We need to make sure that people have dollars in their pockets so that they're able to buy the products from private businesses to keep economic activity moving.,216,,
1264,0.97,8019.845,8027.753,"Just wanted to highlight that and thank you, colleagues.",216,,
1265,0.97,8027.753,8028.92,.,216,,
1266,0.97,8028.92,8067.225,I wanted to put a finer point on something that was included in Tom's response is that I think what is clear with the ongoing conversations about how the city is financing the Covid response and what is and not eligible for FEMA is that the guidance from FEMA has changed or Iterated over the course of the year and there are some things in terms of the risk that we won't know until we have submitted for reimbursement and FEMA issues a decision or issues a check that is some or all of what we reimburse for.,217,,
1267,0.97,8067.225,8081.139,"It is always a choice, in response to the emergency, going forward, and Expending existing resources with the risk of not having them available for other services in the future, so it is, I think, just want to put a final point, there is risk involved.",217,,
1268,0.97,8081.139,8096.388,We won't really know until we get checks from FEMA if the expenditures met all of the eligibility requirements regardless of documentation.,217,,
1269,0.97,8096.388,8097.823,Thank you.,218,,
1270,0.97,8097.823,8104.463,A risk other cities are considering.,219,,
1271,0.97,8104.463,8105.564,"You thank you, Tom, please continue.",219,,
1272,0.97,8105.564,8106.164,"Thank you, Madame chair.",220,,
1273,0.97,8106.164,8116.308,This is a high level view of the most recent Federal aid that the city received from the consolidated appropriations act of 2021.,220,,
1274,0.97,8116.308,8122.814,That is what passed or signed into law in late December.,220,,
1275,0.97,8122.814,8127.986,$22.7 million for rental assistance programs that is directly available for the city.,220,,
1276,0.97,8127.986,8143.335,"I believe it was mentioned earlier that there is pending legislation to spend the direct aid to the city, so that is forth coming.",220,,
1277,0.97,8143.335,8150.408,The next piece is the American rescue plan of 2021.,220,,
1278,0.97,8150.408,8150.742,Arpa for this.,220,,
1279,0.97,8150.742,8152.844,This is currently under deliberation in Congress.,220,,
1280,0.97,8152.844,8153.578,It passed the house.,220,,
1281,0.97,8153.578,8158.316,I believe it is in the Senate now.,220,,
1282,0.97,8158.316,8163.722,This package includes $1.9 trillion for Covid relief across the United States.,220,,
1283,0.97,8163.722,8167.259,That relief takes many different forms.,220,,
1284,0.97,8167.259,8174.933,"Some of it is direct, targeted programs where it may not, perhaps, go directly to the city.",220,,
1285,0.97,8174.933,8177.736,It will be at a level of government.,220,,
1286,0.97,8177.736,8189.881,"There is money in there for rental assistance, homelessness services, investments, funding for vaccines and $25 billion and restaurant grants.",220,,
1287,0.97,8189.881,8202.093,"We don't have any additional specificity on what the city of Seattle's share, what any of the moneys would be, but that is significant aid in that bill.",220,,
1288,0.97,8202.093,8217.142,"More Estimatable for lack of a better word is direct aid for cities and counties, similar to the Crf bill, where in the city of Seattle received $131 million.",220,,
1289,0.97,8217.142,8228.353,There is estimated to be about approximately $221 million of aid that the city of Seattle will be able to use towards Covid response.,220,,
1290,0.97,8228.353,8230.822,We can go to the next slide.,220,,
1291,0.97,8230.822,8236.962,I'll talk about unique characteristics of the aid.,220,,
1292,0.97,8236.962,8246.571,So this is pretty much a draft of the bill as it was in the house.,220,,
1293,0.97,8246.571,8250.642,These are the uses of the $221 million.,220,,
1294,0.97,8250.642,8257.482,"Money can be used to respond, mitigate public health emergency costs, cover costs because of the emergency.",220,,
1295,0.97,8257.482,8258.917,That is similar to the Crf.,220,,
1296,0.97,8258.917,8271.763,This third bullet is one I want to highlight because Crf moneys were not available to offset any revenue losses.,220,,
1297,0.97,8271.763,8285.477,"This money is available to replace money that was lost and they set that benchmark of making the determination of when revenue losses can be assessed as of January 27th, 2020.",220,,
1298,0.97,8285.477,8300.058,"This is important because as you will recall, the city did experience a significant hit to the general fund revenues because of the Covid emergency and the social distancing impacts and things of that nature.",220,,
1299,0.97,8300.058,8303.995,So that is a unique characteristic of the aid.,220,,
1300,0.97,8303.995,8307.332,It provides greater flexibility for the use of the funds.,220,,
1301,0.97,8307.332,8330.255,I think that is a good pivot point to the final two points that I'll make before returning to Yolanda about how this aid may take some place in adjusting for some of the fiscal measures that the city took to respond to the emergency.,220,,
1302,0.97,8330.255,8336.761,"By way of a high level of review, the city has two general purpose fiscal reserves.",220,,
1303,0.97,8336.761,8349.407,"It has an emergency Fund, our resources that the city holds to respond to unanticipated emergencies, so earthquakes, public health emergencies, things of that nature.",220,,
1304,0.97,8349.407,8355.18,There was approximately $61 million in the emergency fund at the start of 2020.,220,,
1305,0.97,8355.18,8375.3,Next is the revenue stabilization fund which is also a pool of resources that the city holds to respond to unanticipated short FALLS in general fund revenues that Basicall would have resulted in decreasing the scope of government services that can be provided.,220,,
1306,0.97,8375.3,8386.244,I believe there was about $66 million in that revenue stabilization fund prior to the emergency.,220,,
1307,0.97,8386.244,8400.525,"Unfortunately, the Covid emergency has a duel characteristic of both needing to accelerate spending to help the community and continue to provide services in response to the emergency.",220,,
1308,0.97,8400.525,8403.828,"Also, it has the impact on the city revenue streams.",220,,
1309,0.97,8403.828,8416.174,"We did, in fact, as you will recall, tap both of the reserves fairly essentially.",220,,
1310,0.97,8416.174,8446.571,"These are fiscal Reserve friends that support the level of supportive balances, going back to 2006, so 15 years ago we had over $40 million and we have built that reserve, even through the great recession, never drawing it below that amount up until last year and then the 2021 budget where in total we drew about $90 million of those reserves.",220,,
1311,0.97,8446.571,8455.58,"In fact, council action in the 2021 budget brought those reserves about to the level that they were.",220,,
1312,0.97,8455.58,8463.388,It was approximately $6 million and I have given favorable information on the revenue forecast in November.,220,,
1313,0.97,8463.388,8470.228,Council positioned some of those moneys to Redeposit back.,220,,
1314,0.97,8470.228,8493.785,"It is worth seeing this trend, because with regard to the $221 million, because just to ensure that this is captured in the strategic decision making on how the moneys are used given that they can help with response to fiscal measures that we had to take to respond to the emergency.",220,,
1315,0.97,8493.785,8494.219,I'll pause quickly.,220,,
1316,0.97,8494.219,8497.856,"I think this is a familiar chart, but it is an important one.",220,,
1317,0.97,8497.856,8520.578,"It is an important one and I think if there was a bar between the 2020 and 2021, it would be the proposed mayors send down to near zero, $3 million in total reserves and you'll see it go back up like the Council did in the adopted budget.",221,,
1318,0.97,8520.578,8521.279,Councilmember Morales.,221,,
1319,0.97,8521.279,8522.247,You have a question.,221,,
1320,0.97,8522.247,8522.48,I do.,222,,
1321,0.97,8522.48,8528.553,"Can we go back to slide nine, a couple of questions about the rental assistance.",222,,
1322,0.97,8528.553,8530.355,You mentioned here the 22.7 million.,222,,
1323,0.97,8530.355,8537.295,Is that in addition to the 8 million that you mentioned previously?,222,,
1324,0.97,8537.295,8540.064,"Yes, Councilmember Morales.",223,,
1325,0.97,8540.064,8545.37,"So that is 31, roughly.",224,,
1326,0.97,8545.37,8560.251,"And then for this money for rental assistance, you know if that will go through the city or is that going to go through the United way for example, had a program where that money went.",224,,
1327,0.97,8560.251,8565.523,Do you have a sense of where that structure is going to look like?,224,,
1328,0.97,8565.523,8566.457,Tracy is on the call.,225,,
1329,0.97,8566.457,8570.395,She may be able to add more.,225,,
1330,0.97,8570.395,8581.239,"To my knowledge, the full 22.7 does flow through the city and will be spent through a pending ordinance in the works right now.",225,,
1331,0.97,8581.239,8581.673,That's correct.,226,,
1332,0.97,8581.673,8582.574,Okay.,227,,
1333,0.97,8582.574,8594.819,"And one more question, going back to the issue, do you have any sense of the kind of equity in the distribution.",227,,
1334,0.97,8594.819,8618.242,"We have a lot of smaller food banks, food Pantries that particularly support immigrant and refugee populations and so when our food dollars just go to the very large food banks, there is a large part of the community that is left out of that allocation, so do you know if there is any conversation about addressing that gap?",227,,
1335,0.97,8618.242,8622.38,"Councilmember Morales, I do not have that level of detail.",228,,
1336,0.97,8622.38,8633.291,"We will add this, your question to our list of follow UPS.",228,,
1337,0.97,8633.291,8633.625,Thank you.,229,,
1338,0.97,8633.625,8635.226,.,229,,
1339,0.97,8635.226,8642.533,"So, if there aren't any further questions about the fiscal reserves, I'll next move to the other piece.",230,,
1340,0.97,8642.533,8648.339,This is just rounding out the kind of fiscal analysis of the Covid response.,230,,
1341,0.97,8648.339,8656.114,So this is a table I like to show my work and so that is what this is.,230,,
1342,0.97,8656.114,8670.161,This is generally showing you how the pay roll expense tax that was recently passed by Council last summer with first revenues being available in 2021 and continuing in the future.,230,,
1343,0.97,8670.161,8677.835,It is basically showing how those revenues are deployed in the future.,230,,
1344,0.97,8677.835,8686.611,"Just as a high level caveat, calculations being made in the table are based off of a six year financial plan that is included with adopted budget.",230,,
1345,0.97,8686.611,8706.731,"What it does, what the financial plan does is it takes at adopted budget and then applies a set of assumptions to those lines and projects in the future what the financial status of the Fund, in this case, the general Fund, will be.",230,,
1346,0.97,8706.731,8711.335,It is not a policy statement or making future policy decisions.,230,,
1347,0.97,8711.335,8713.571,That is an important thing to note.,230,,
1348,0.97,8713.571,8716.374,It is not a statement of policy.,230,,
1349,0.97,8716.374,8729.787,"It is more a, given what decisions were made in the adopted budget and then various assumptions about how revenues will grow and wages and salaries will grow, what does the status of the fund look like?",230,,
1350,0.97,8729.787,8745.603,"At the bottom line or I guess, row C and Row f on this table, you'll see that in the financial plan, the general fund is essentially balanced at $1.6 million in 2020 so this is projected.",230,,
1351,0.97,8745.603,8755.046,"Not this year, but next year and the two years there after, growing from $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion.",230,,
1352,0.97,8755.046,8765.723,"And within those lines, you can see base general fund revenues and general fund expenditures.",230,,
1353,0.97,8765.723,8770.027,Base general fund revenues are $1.36 billion.,230,,
1354,0.97,8770.027,8772.663,Base general fund expenditures are 1.495 billion.,230,,
1355,0.97,8772.663,8798.256,"So what I have done here is I have included the new pay roll tax revenue projects for 2022 through 2024 to show how that balances that out and then in the end, there is an allocated piece and some assumption that the payroll tax would support base services in 2022 and beyond.",230,,
1356,0.97,8798.256,8805.763,"If you look at the next slide, you can see some extracted pieces from that table.",230,,
1357,0.97,8805.763,8809.967,The payroll tax brings in about 233 million.,230,,
1358,0.97,8809.967,8815.506,This is the projected number and it grows to 255 million by 2024.,230,,
1359,0.97,8815.506,8822.213,There is a line in the financial plan that is an Unallocated piece.,230,,
1360,0.97,8822.213,8830.688,This is just in reserves without a specific decision being made about how that is spent.,230,,
1361,0.97,8830.688,8855.079,"You will recall that during the jump start Seattle discussion, so the proposed payroll expense tax there, was a resolution 31957 that was adopted by the city council that characterized some broad, actually, fairly specific guidelines for how those new payroll expense tax moneys would be spent.",230,,
1362,0.97,8855.079,8875.299,"In 2021, given that we were in the midst of the or expected to continue to be in the midst of the Covid emergency there, was an allowance that the payroll expense tax will",230,,
1363,0.97,8882.773,8901.259,"2022 and beyond, that is not what this indicates . The monies are to be used for affordable housing, green you deal, small business assistance in those types of expenses.",231,,
1364,0.97,8901.259,8915.273,"This table shows that right now based on a set of assumptions and adopted budget, there is an Unallocated piece of $100 million.",231,,
1365,0.97,8915.273,8926.183,That is available to dedicate towards those Jumpstart Seattle spending provisions in the 2022 budget process.,231,,
1366,0.97,8926.183,8940.097,"But, based on everything so far, the payroll expense tax would be supporting on the order of $133 million of basic governmental services.",231,,
1367,0.97,8940.097,8945.303,"Of course, this is a point in time analysis.",231,,
1368,0.97,8945.303,8954.879,New information that will be available from the revenue forecast that counsel will receive in the summer.,231,,
1369,0.97,8954.879,8964.088,"Hopefully it will be favorable and we will--it could go the other direction, as well.",231,,
1370,0.97,8964.088,8968.926,That is the point of the exercise is to see where we are at that point in time.,231,,
1371,0.97,8968.926,8979.236,And further actual funding decisions will be made in the fall and there will be an additional forecast update.,231,,
1372,0.97,8979.236,8988.646,This is to show that payroll expense tax now as everything stands is supporting services.,231,,
1373,0.97,8988.646,9008.132,"Given that the identification of the new monies from the $221 million and how it can be used to offset revenue losses, there may be an element of for Council consideration building into the resolution discussed earlier.",231,,
1374,0.97,9008.132,9015.84,A way to Deleverage these payroll expense tax revenues out of supporting based services in the future.,231,,
1375,0.97,9015.84,9022.179,And moving more towards supporting purposes in the Jumpstart spending plan.,231,,
1376,0.97,9022.179,9030.454,Thank you for the orientation to slides 13 and 14.,232,,
1377,0.97,9030.454,9031.188,A few important points.,232,,
1378,0.97,9031.188,9035.092,"When we talk about the six-year general fund financial plan, this is the Mayor's proposal.",232,,
1379,0.97,9035.092,9038.896,This is not coming from Council.,232,,
1380,0.97,9038.896,9047.505,If I could--I wouldn't even characterize that as the Mayor's proposal.,233,,
1381,0.97,9047.505,9056.113,It is really just applying technical assumptions to the 2022--2021 adopted budget.,233,,
1382,0.97,9056.113,9059.283,It does come from the executive.,233,,
1383,0.97,9059.283,9075.433,It is built by city budget office staff but there is not a specific decision about any policy measures in the future and being made specifically in this plan.,233,,
1384,0.97,9075.433,9111.268,"It is really just that's the calculations I have done to identify for full visibility for the committee that is everything stands now, given the--projected revenue in the future, and anticipated projected expense we would have been future, the payroll expense tax will be supporting based governmental services at a larger portion than was contemplated in the Jumpstart Blnding--resolution.",233,,
1385,0.97,9111.268,9118.576,I wanted to add . I don't disagree with anything Tom said.,234,,
1386,0.97,9118.576,9125.483,It is not a statement of policy or not necessarily--analysis of a point in time.,234,,
1387,0.97,9125.483,9129.587,It's not adopted policy but it is worth noting.,234,,
1388,0.97,9129.587,9130.754,I move back to the slide.,234,,
1389,0.97,9130.754,9144.602,There is a footnote that indicates what these Unallocated funds may be used for and it's not even necessarily being assumed for implementation of the Jumpstart spending plan.,234,,
1390,0.97,9144.602,9166.59,"That is noted in footnote 2. we are flagging this for the committees understanding as you have choices ahead on how to continue to fund Bay city services, as well as implement the commitments made in the Jumpstart spending plan.",234,,
1391,0.97,9166.59,9175.766,It is going to be a balancing act.,234,,
1392,0.97,9175.766,9182.139,We wanted to continue to flag this issue now so you can consider strategies on how to balance those decisions.,234,,
1393,0.97,9182.139,9190.347,The 2021 technical assumptions.,235,,
1394,0.97,9190.347,9194.451,That he used to extrapolate those over the next 3 to 4 years.,235,,
1395,0.97,9194.451,9204.061,It's helpful to provide some indication of how those funds are potentially going to be proposed to be used.,235,,
1396,0.97,9204.061,9206.463,If that is the way to understand it.,235,,
1397,0.97,9206.463,9229.386,"It is a red flag that the very thoughtful and detailed span plan that we put together in partnership with business and labor and housing and community organizations and environmentalists and transit folks, that plan is not potentially being adhered to if the technical assumptions are to go forward.",235,,
1398,0.97,9229.386,9251.308,"When we look at line I. the assumption was that in 2020 when--2022, the total amount of expenses were going to be around 233--north of 215 million.",235,,
1399,0.97,9251.308,9257.681,And their plan we knew we wanted 65% of the funding to go to housing and homeless services.,235,,
1400,0.97,9257.681,9268.459,And that 65% of that was to be able to invest in housing Affordability crisis we have in the city.,235,,
1401,0.97,9268.459,9270.427,That was supposed to be 65% of 230+.,235,,
1402,0.97,9270.427,9272.129,Not 65% of 133.,235,,
1403,0.97,9272.129,9290.314,"Colleagues, I appreciate--I understand and thank you that this is not a proposal and not a directive in terms of what is going to be necessarily reflected in the budget.",235,,
1404,0.97,9290.314,9313.17,But I think it is a flag for us that it is a chance to consider strategies to make sure that we establish some parameters around making sure the Jumpstart spending plan is it Hereto as discussed with community and the trust we built with the broader community who helped create the span plan package and supported Jumpstart's progressive payroll that we have sideboards that go with that.,235,,
1405,0.97,9313.17,9322.579,Councilmember Strauss indicated that we as Council itself as the legislative body does not have spending authority.,235,,
1406,0.97,9322.579,9327.584,What we do have is the ability to pass legislation and put directives on how we think the spending should be used.,235,,
1407,0.97,9327.584,9335.059,"That is what we have done in the budget, and frankly what we have attempted to do in the resolution regarding span plan.",235,,
1408,0.97,9335.059,9355.379,"It comes to documents, there are concerns I will continue to raise and would like to work with you all on in the budget director and others on central Taff to make sure we have a better understanding of when Council put directives to spend, that we know if those dollars have been spent at how much and what remains.",235,,
1409,0.97,9355.379,9357.414,That is the crux of the questions I've heard today.,235,,
1410,0.97,9357.414,9374.331,"To me this gets to the heart of as a Council and legislative body, we can respond to the call to invest in certain things but it has to be followed through the budget document needs to be adhered to.",235,,
1411,0.97,9374.331,9376.2,I'm interested in Workingwith you.,235,,
1412,0.97,9376.2,9397.921,"I would like to consider setting up a Jumpstart payroll tax Fund and financial policies to ensure the Council's intent was clear to provide transparency and tracking sources including financial policies that would allow us to use the payroll revenues to support Sunday services due to the pandemic, and induced revenue losses.",235,,
1413,0.97,9397.921,9407.664,We want to make sure there is clear adherence to the span plan as initially discussed when we were considering Jumpstart's progressive payroll tax.,235,,
1414,0.97,9407.664,9413.27,In the items we committed to our Prioritized.,235,,
1415,0.97,9413.27,9425.949,We intentionally in 2021 have allocated a certain portion of anticipated future revenue to doing things like supporting core services.,235,,
1416,0.97,9425.949,9428.685,It's important we put sideboards around that.,235,,
1417,0.97,9428.685,9448.572,I appreciate your flag in the context of the $221 million we anticipate from the American recovery plan bill considered in Congress . and there is a possibility that this revenue can be used as a revenue replacement tool to reduce reliance on other areas of funds in our city.,235,,
1418,0.97,9448.572,9457.314,In an effort to prevent a grab of payroll tax dollars and put them into general fund.,235,,
1419,0.97,9457.314,9476.333,There is potential to Backfill that with the 221 million recognizing many of these core services are part of what--when we talked about make a our core government services could be invested in and austerity budget was not engaged in or not advanced.,235,,
1420,0.97,9476.333,9480.804,Thank you for flagging that.,235,,
1421,0.97,9480.804,9491.315,To address bullet number two on the slide.,235,,
1422,0.97,9491.315,9492.416,Any additional comments.,235,,
1423,0.97,9492.416,9492.95,Okay.,235,,
1424,0.97,9492.95,9496.753,Let's get to the resolution.,235,,
1425,0.97,9496.753,9498.255,The resolution is not included on the agenda.,235,,

1432,0.97,9526.416,9533.891,Building on the chair's opening . in terms of the context setting.,236,,
1433,0.97,9533.891,9584.508,"Also want to know that the first two bullets were covered thoroughly and that we also want to note that city is not trying to address the crisis and that the resolution recognizes a need to leverage other funding and programs were possible . In addition to the need to continue funding the workforce to allow for delivery of critical services to Seattle's residents, it's important to note that the city does have limited capacity and ability to expand services and distribute funding to the community . In some cases it may be administratively Unfeasible to deliver great amount of services or funding in a short period of time even if sufficient funding is made available.",236,,
1434,0.97,9584.508,9625.182,"In terms of the draft resolution, we did not include specific funding allocations or percentages because as Tom mentioned, the legislation for the American rescue plan act is still under consideration . We wanted to wait on any confirmation on the final amount and whether there would be any strings attached . also knowing how much money the city might anticipate from the targeted Federal aid as well.",237,,
1435,0.97,9625.182,9649.172,Also noting that staff need to work with executive in terms with understanding the cost of extending and expanding the cities Covid-19 Willie programs until the end of year and to identify where there may be gaps in services.,237,,
1436,0.97,9649.172,9654.011,The draft resolution is organized around these four guiding principles.,237,,
1437,0.97,9654.011,9655.145,Equity being first and foremost.,237,,
1438,0.97,9655.145,9663.42,"We know that our Latinx and--communities, black communities, have been hardest hit by the Covid-19 pandemic.",237,,
1439,0.97,9663.42,9673.196,These populations are also represented in our front-line workforce and more likely to be exposed to Covid-19.,237,,
1440,0.97,9673.196,9678.802,This principle is about ensuring that investments in these communities is a top priority as we receive this Federal funding.,237,,
1441,0.97,9678.802,9685.142,Next is the coordination piece in terms of context setting.,237,,
1442,0.97,9685.142,9697.154,This principle acknowledges the city is one of many entities addressing this public health and economic crisis and should use as Federal dollars to fill in gaps.,237,,
1443,0.97,9697.154,9697.521,Flexibility.,237,,
1444,0.97,9697.521,9702.259,The city should be nimble and prepared to adjust strategy to maximize response to emergent needs.,237,,
1445,0.97,9702.259,9717.074,And resilience Federal funds used if possible to guard against future uncertainty and position the city to make new investments as described in the Jumpstart spending plan.,237,,
1446,0.97,9717.074,9735.459,"In the interest of time, I will not go through all specific spending priorities included in the draft, but we will NOTE they are proved under the seven Categori that you see on the slide.",238,,
1447,0.97,9735.459,9746.903,"Many of the priorities included would continue existing city relief efforts, some of which will end in a few months like emergency voucher program and that the food assistance programs.",238,,
1448,0.97,9746.903,9759.082,"Or others that have been exhausted or will soon be exhausting their findings such as the small business stabilization Fund, Childcare Stabilization and Covid-19 disaster relief fund for immigrants.",238,,
1449,0.97,9759.082,9783.44,"Notable our priorities to invest in Childcare and Longer- term, speaking back to the pivoting to longer-term economic recovery with the goal of encouraging establishment of Childcare options for families and Prioritizing the replenishment of the city's general-purpose fiscal reserves.",238,,

1475,0.97,9927.984,9943.133,"If there are very specific programs or service, Councilmembers are interested in, considering funding with the anticipated additional Federal Fuds, is going to take time to figure out what those are and work with the executives.",243,,

1484,0.97,9989.512,10000.757,We have director noble ad Jeff Sims from central staff.,246,,
1485,0.97,10000.757,10009.032,"Jeff will provide comments to Orient us to this topic because if folks haven't followed along with the conversations and committees, a ground setting here.",246,,
1486,0.97,10009.032,10015.772,"Councilmember Lewis, I will ask if you have something to add.",246,,
1487,0.97,10015.772,10026.983,Mostly we are here for our guest Speaker to help give us a quick update as to the extent possible on conversations that will be welcome news.,246,,
1488,0.97,10026.983,10051.207,"A week ago were two weeks ago on the meeting on homelessness, update provided on a large hotel sheltering surge strategy provided by Council with Esd money for 2021.",247,,
1489,0.97,10051.207,10053.81,I want go into that intervention.,247,,
1490,0.97,10053.81,10055.712,The status was provided recently.,247,,
1491,0.97,10055.712,10061.117,I will go into the just care program presented to Council Committee in December.,247,,
1492,0.97,10061.117,10066.189,To make sure everyone has a top of mind.,247,,
1493,0.97,10066.189,10091.347,"The consortium of providers--overall it is a strategy that utilizes hotels to house people that were on sheltered and square in the International district . a lot of individuals are not only experiencing homelessness but also have high barriers to housing, especially high rates of substance abuse and things like that.",247,,
1494,0.97,10091.347,10099.155,The program was started by the county when a $4 million appropriation was made to the program in June of last year using C.A.R.E.S.,247,,
1495,0.97,10099.155,10100.123,Act funding.,247,,
1496,0.97,10100.123,10105.361,$3 million of that $4 million was used.,247,,
1497,0.97,10105.361,10111.568,The county provided additional funding from what I understand two programs to operate until Mid-March.,247,,
1498,0.97,10111.568,10120.577,Sometime in December the program has been maintaining its capacity.,247,,
1499,0.97,10120.577,10123.58,128 individuals who have been sheltered in these hotel rooms.,247,,
1500,0.97,10123.58,10129.586,It has not been accepting new entrants.,247,,
1501,0.97,10129.586,10138.761,The extension the county has provided would not make that possible and maintaining 128 beds.,247,,
1502,0.97,10138.761,10160.316,"The Council has been provided information about what it would take to maintain this program and expanding it to be 310 beds were spaces for individuals through September 30, the end up of the public health emergency related to Covid-19.",247,,
1503,0.97,10160.316,10167.056,That would be around 10 1/2 million dollars to not only maintain but expand the costs for the remainder of September 30.,247,,
1504,0.97,10167.056,10180.537,"That is a high-level summary of that program . It is a separate thing from other strategies, especially the ones that the Mayor's office and--provided updates on recently.",247,,
1505,0.97,10180.537,10195.552,"Also because I was prompted to, Councilmember Lewis asked me about the difference between what is--when services move from being on one side for a female Reimbursable to not.",247,,
1506,0.97,10195.552,10200.256,-- female Reimbursable to not.,247,,
1507,0.97,10200.256,10203.059,To a large degree that is an Unknowable answer.,247,,
1508,0.97,10203.059,10211.534,It's going to take us receiving a reimbursement before we have a strong sense of what is the type of activity.,247,,
1509,0.97,10211.534,10219.776,There is a lot of pieces that go along with submitting an expense for reimbursement that will come into play there.,247,,
1510,0.97,10219.776,10228.585,A broad rule of thumb which is going to--satisfactory.,247,,
1511,0.97,10228.585,10235.124,"If you had been hit by Hurricane and we did an intervention that provided shelter to people where of the city had been, would FEMA have covered that expense.",247,,
1512,0.97,10235.124,10246.069,That is how the coverage for the shelter intervention was intended in addition when the program was established.,247,,
1513,0.97,10246.069,10273.529,"Most importantly for the city, the decision point is not based on whether or not FEMA what are were not provide--but rather looking at what is the essential thing that has to be done in order to provide services necessary so individuals expensing homelessness are at heightened risk for severe or contracting a severe outcome or contracting Covid-19 due to conditions.",247,,
1514,0.97,10273.529,10278.635,What is that the city needs to be doing to allow them to socially isolate and avoid severe reactions.,247,,
1515,0.97,10278.635,10281.237,That is decision.,247,,
1516,0.97,10281.237,10289.712,More so then the nuances of what is precisely available for FEMA reimbursement.,247,,
1517,0.97,10289.712,10295.351,Those are two different questions.,247,,
1518,0.97,10295.351,10299.122,Another question here.,247,,
1519,0.97,10299.122,10302.959,That will be--that is it for a broad overview.,247,,
1520,0.97,10302.959,10305.461,Director noble has other updates.,247,,
1521,0.97,10305.461,10311.267,Just wanted to check.,248,,
1522,0.97,10311.267,10317.073,"Councilmember Lewis, did you have follow-up on that or additional comments for context setting?",248,,
1523,0.97,10317.073,10317.407,Thank you.,249,,
1524,0.97,10317.407,10327.383,Thank you for letting us take some time and you are committee to keep the discussion going on this issue.,249,,
1525,0.97,10327.383,10338.594,There has been a lot in the news about it recently so it's a good opportunity for central staff at the budget office and Councilmembers to be able to check in and get some of these questions answered.,249,,
1526,0.97,10338.594,10389.245,"I want to--as a table setting say I was very moved again by the broad and expansive public comment that we heard related to that just care program in coalition that includes service providers and leaders in the business community and downtown Seattle Association, Passageways . It's our obligation as leaders to work closely with the county to figure out a way that we can use whatever resource regardless of what it is, whether FEMA reimbursement or whether it is one-time Federal money . any kind of creative option to come up with some kind of solution.",249,,
1527,0.97,10389.245,10397.52,"Councilmember Mosqueda, you have been talking closely with the county, as I have.",249,,
1528,0.97,10397.52,10404.627,There are potentially legislative Passageways we can pursue as a Council in collaboration to have cautionary arrangement.,249,,
1529,0.97,10404.627,10422.078,I want to acknowledge that underlying motivation here to explore all of these different components of how to do it and nail down answers on FEMA funding.,249,,
1530,0.97,10422.078,10423.98,That's what I'm looking forward to getting answers on today.,249,,
1531,0.97,10423.98,10429.385,Knowing that some of this is not Knowable but there are ways we can plan to mitigate risks.,249,,
1532,0.97,10429.385,10438.394,We are seeing that there is a scheduled removal of the homeless accountants at Demme Park for Wednesday.,249,,
1533,0.97,10438.394,10458.414,"I know from being out there with outreach workers on a regular basis, probably on average twice a month, that the most sought after placement of people living there are tiny House villages based on what I hear directly from people living in that park.",249,,
1534,0.97,10458.414,10469.158,"We need to make sure that we are exploring every Avenue so that when a removal happens, we are not just sending folks to go camp in front of somebody else's business.",249,,
1535,0.97,10469.158,10480.036,We need to remove them to a place where they can get their needs met and I hope we get more answers on that and how we can plan Proactively as a Council and Mayor to meet those goals.,249,,
1536,0.97,10480.036,10483.339,Thank you.,249,,
1537,0.97,10483.339,10485.041,Director noble.,250,,

1539,0.97,10499.655,10500.456,Could you start over?,251,,
1540,0.97,10500.456,10502.558,We loss your Audio.,251,,
1541,0.97,10502.558,10511.267,I don't have a formal announcement with respect to--but I want to express information.,252,,
1542,0.97,10511.267,10518.107,One is executive shares concern about individuals for enrollment in the population.,252,,
1543,0.97,10518.107,10524.08,Recognize the need there.,252,,
1544,0.97,10524.08,10528.184,I have no desire to not provide some level of services to those individuals.,252,,
1545,0.97,10528.184,10538.494,We are in active conversation with the county about a solution near-term and longer-term for the population.,252,,
1546,0.97,10538.494,10540.963,I have a meeting this afternoon.,252,,
1547,0.97,10540.963,10548.271,We haven't settled any precise plan forward.,252,,
1548,0.97,10548.271,10550.139,Those talks are ongoing and I'm optimistic about a solution.,252,,
1549,0.97,10550.139,10555.011,We have a shared interest in serving the population and addressing the overall issues.,252,,
1550,0.97,10555.011,10570.393,One of the point I want to make--as now Configured and procured the care program is not--not funded that way.,252,,
1551,0.97,10570.393,10587.843,"It is an extension and couldn't be funded with FEMA dollars as they are now being allocated by the Federal Government . As we look forward, there are different ways to procure a comparable service . The guidance from the Federal Government could be changing on this front.",252,,
1552,0.97,10587.843,10592.915,You for a lot about that today.,252,,
1553,0.97,10592.915,10605.261,We have a general sense that the new administration is taking a more helpful approach if you will but there has been no additional specific guidance that has been handed out on this front.,252,,
1554,0.97,10605.261,10607.33,We are still waiting for that.,252,,
1555,0.97,10607.33,10625.281,"As indicated, we will receive Federal funding in various forms . We expect a small block grant, larger location for flexible purposes.",252,,
1556,0.97,10625.281,10646.202,There is also as outlined for you today some direct homelessness funding identified in the current draft of the Federal bill . any interactions between those direct dollars either for homelessness or the direct dollars to the city and FEMA eligibility is among the things we will need guidance on.,252,,
1557,0.97,10646.202,10651.407,We are not waiting on all of that and those options.,252,,
1558,0.97,10651.407,10661.917,"Continuing to work with the county for near-term and Longer- term, recognizing we have been collaborating to date on this front and others in will need to going forward.",252,,
1559,0.97,10661.917,10670.159,The county will proceed as we expect in will receive a significant allocation of Federal dollars for flexibility.,252,,
1560,0.97,10670.159,10675.097,Will want to explore resources.,252,,

1568,0.97,10697.019,10713.269,"I will highlight . I know in my conversations last year ahead of the removal, my request was to use a just care style program in this.",254,,
1569,0.97,10713.269,10716.038,"The response I received, what happens when we are no longer receiving Federal dollars.",254,,
1570,0.97,10716.038,10726.382,"In Pioneer square, not my district, Councilman Lewis is district, we know just care is deployed and has been effective in here we are.",254,,
1571,0.97,10726.382,10735.191,Where we need to continue funding these units of housing or shelter.,254,,
1572,0.97,10735.191,10755.678,My concern at this time is that there will be a greater cost to our city if we cannot continue to fund this program.,254,,
1573,0.97,10755.678,10784.907,"When folks are returned to the streets, returned to the alleyways in the doorways, we heard directly this morning from public comment about how individuals have been stabilized to where unstable in financial and Quality-Of-Life impacts.",254,,
1574,0.97,10784.907,10804.76,And budgeting we often have to look at the cost benefit . There is also the need for us to understand what private costs are being associated when we as a government are not providing the solutions we know we need.,254,,
1575,0.97,10804.76,10806.262,"I don't have a question for you, director noble.",254,,
1576,0.97,10806.262,10813.469,I trust your work I'd appreciate you.,254,,
1577,0.97,10813.469,10822.178,"When we do not provide funding for programs like just care, there is a greater cost to our city.",254,,
1578,0.97,10822.178,10826.148,Thank you for the comments.,255,,
1579,0.97,10826.148,10829.118,I was listening and my ears were burning.,255,,
1580,0.97,10829.118,10831.787,Much appreciated.,255,,
1581,0.97,10831.787,10848.27,Your comments highlight another dimension . The balance between service we provide and impacts that are felt if we don't is a constant Trade-Off.,255,,
1582,0.97,10848.27,10853.309,One of the key dimensions of the new Federal dollars we are waiting to see more about is the Timeline over which they need to be expended.,255,,
1583,0.97,10853.309,10861.617,Currently as we understand it no cutoff date that might change as the bill moves forward.,255,,
1584,0.97,10861.617,10862.785,Comments made and presentations earlier.,255,,
1585,0.97,10862.785,10863.819,That is a big dynamic.,255,,
1586,0.97,10863.819,10886.542,One of the things that hit us the third week of December last year was a change with regard to Crf dollars regarding their use of the 2021 and not just 2020 which led to allocation shifting that you saw in some slides today to taking advantage of the new flexibility.,255,,
1587,0.97,10886.542,10888.21,The Timeline will be critical.,255,,
1588,0.97,10888.21,10899.255,We will have to think about the private resource we have in allocating if we're going to be expanding services.,255,,
1589,0.97,10899.255,10907.162,"The path to sustaining those at higher level with alternative funding source, or ahead of time how they may be phased out.",255,,
1590,0.97,10907.162,10908.264,"If so, over what time frame.",255,,
1591,0.97,10908.264,10922.144,"That is one of the--the size of the allocation which has not been decided, and the Timeframe for which it is available will be one of the key things we will be watching.",255,,
1592,0.97,10922.144,10939.194,"Really appreciate hearing this news, director noble, about your conversations with Kent County about the extension of the program.",256,,
1593,0.97,10939.194,10942.932,It sounds to me like there is a need for a near-term funding strategy in a long-term funding strategy.,256,,
1594,0.97,10942.932,10962.284,"As it relates to the near-term, because I don't think anybody--believes that we will have access to Federal funds by Federal--March 15--it seems like we need a very near-term funding strategy.",256,,
1595,0.97,10962.284,10976.332,"Councilmember Lewis as discussed potentially proposing legislation using some of the 2020 reserves in order to Tesh in the near term, help find it just cares.",256,,
1596,0.97,10976.332,10986.542,Am I hearing you that that would be considered useful by the executive?,256,,
1597,0.97,10986.542,10998.554,"At this stage, this program was established as a county program and we think near-term it makes sense that they provide the financial support near-term.",257,,
1598,0.97,10998.554,11015.537,"But again as we move forward, we have been in partnership overall with regard to serving the homeless population as it has been affected by Covid-19.",257,,
1599,0.97,11015.537,11020.676,I think the discussion is about the near-term and long-term and what the partnership looks like.,257,,
1600,0.97,11020.676,11026.248,Councilmember Lewis and I have been working on that legislation.,258,,
1601,0.97,11026.248,11044.066,"We have that Teed up and then hearing the possibility of this ongoing partnership extension, possible extension for the Near- term, and possible partnership for the longer-term.",258,,
1602,0.97,11044.066,11047.369,We wanted to keep this item on the agenda to make sure we heard updates.,258,,
1603,0.97,11047.369,11057.112,This is very important to make sure the near-term extension or funding is filled . Councilman Lewis?,258,,
1604,0.97,11057.112,11073.429,I think--Riffing off of Lisa Herbold's question and talk more about structuring something for the long haul here like a long-term planning.,259,,
1605,0.97,11073.429,11082.604,"I want to thank you, director noble, for your detailed memo that was sent or Email I should say based on inquiries from the Council.",259,,
1606,0.97,11082.604,11096.351,"I really saw that is something--my reaction was Okay, we know what the hoops are so let's start setting up something to jump through them.",259,,
1607,0.97,11096.351,11108.33,"Based on that feedback, we are currently in these conversations about the extension of the county program and figuring out ways we can be a helpful partner.",259,,
1608,0.97,11108.33,11109.665,In guiding that discussion.,259,,
1609,0.97,11109.665,11117.739,But I think the bigger role I'm seeing for the city is going to be that long-term support.,259,,
1610,0.97,11117.739,11152.774,"My question would be, am I reading it correctly that if this Council were to work with your office to to carefully--to carefully put together a process that includes open procurement, and that is tailored to what we know theme is Reimbursable for and if we are following the model we have seen be successful in San Francisco and Los Angeles in pursuing the FEMA Reimbursable component.",259,,
1611,0.97,11152.774,11169.625,"That that would be a path forward thinking more long-term, although it's not available in the short term because as you stated earlier, did not go through a lot of the formalities on the front end.",259,,
1612,0.97,11169.625,11181.103,"Thinking for the long-term knowing this is a problem we will be staring at for a long time, really taking your memo and then working intentionally to put together what we need to do . to make it happen.",259,,
1613,0.97,11181.103,11185.407,I wanted to get your insight into that.,259,,
1614,0.97,11185.407,11189.745,That I have a couple of other quick follow-up questions.,259,,
1615,0.97,11189.745,11193.248,In broad strokes [Indiscernible - low volume].,260,,
1616,0.97,11193.248,11203.225,The Email in this conversation about FEMA is not intended to say therefore we cannot.,260,,
1617,0.97,11203.225,11204.159,Nor is it a panacea.,260,,
1618,0.97,11204.159,11211.833,We don't have an Endlessource of funding without restriction.,260,,
1619,0.97,11211.833,11232.588,"Clearly we need a long-term strategy and when I was describing that acknowledges time frames over which we will have Federal funding, whether it be FEMA reimbursement . that is another change, only in the past month we have gotten direction from FEMA that resources will be available to the end of December and previously we were working three months at a time.",260,,
1620,0.97,11232.588,11243.899,Long-term strategy takes into account the Federal resources and our own resources and how those can be woven together.,260,,
1621,0.97,11243.899,11253.041,One of the reasons I'm anxious to hear from DC about what the Timeframe which the resources are available and what restrictions they have.,260,,
1622,0.97,11253.041,11256.278,I guess my question.,261,,
1623,0.97,11256.278,11264.519,If this Council--let's let aside just care and talk on a broader level of abstraction.,261,,
1624,0.97,11264.519,11294.549,"If this Council sent legislation like to get specific--the rising and Interfund loan for a demented money backed up with money in reserve, setting up a procurement process tailored to those requirements of over 65 or vulnerable due to unique exposure, and saying we would like the executive to go out and seek a hotel specifically for this group of people.",261,,
1625,0.97,11294.549,11297.753,We are authorizing a loan to do it?,261,,
1626,0.97,11297.753,11304.993,And we want to go through the entire bells and whistles prescribed needed to go through for the FEMA process.,261,,
1627,0.97,11304.993,11313.602,With the executive implement that legislation to seek that FEMA reimbursement.,261,,
1628,0.97,11313.602,11325.347,I'm saying that could be in addition to other Esd money and put that into just care or whatever.,261,,
1629,0.97,11325.347,11326.648,There is so much need out there.,261,,
1630,0.97,11326.648,11329.017,There are so many people that fall into the FEMA Reimbursable category.,261,,
1631,0.97,11329.017,11336.491,We could craft some policy here to get them inside and seek FEMA reimbursement.,261,,
1632,0.97,11336.491,11338.593,Maybe ask more pointedly.,261,,
1633,0.97,11338.593,11344.833,You will get a Nonanswer for me because I'm not the policy expert.,262,,
1634,0.97,11344.833,11349.805,I'm not the one to speak to . We need an overall strategy.,262,,
1635,0.97,11349.805,11355.477,I care about the financial side of it.,262,,
1636,0.97,11355.477,11356.445,In anticipation of Federal money.,262,,
1637,0.97,11356.445,11364.286,My guess is we will get it resolved by the end of the month.,262,,
1638,0.97,11364.286,11374.73,We got a check for $131 million last year not long after the original stimulus bill passed.,262,,
1639,0.97,11374.73,11376.131,Cash management is not the issue.,262,,
1640,0.97,11376.131,11380.802,It is the underlying policy.,262,,
1641,0.97,11380.802,11382.204,Those policies--I am not the expert.,262,,
1642,0.97,11382.204,11387.342,They are about immediate need and long-term Sustainability.,262,,
1643,0.97,11387.342,11393.315,I know that folks are ready and willing to engage in that conversation and to identify policies and path forward.,262,,
1644,0.97,11393.315,11398.954,Let me ask where it is more comfortably in your field.,263,,
1645,0.97,11398.954,11402.124,"What I just said is technically feasible, correct?",263,,
1646,0.97,11402.124,11409.464,I acknowledge that maybe there is a policy discussion that would better be answered by a deputy Mayor.,263,,
1647,0.97,11409.464,11416.438,In time--in terms of --,263,,
1648,0.97,11416.438,11422.878,There are FEMA restrictions around Non-Congregate shelter and those who are eligible.,264,,
1649,0.97,11422.878,11433.321,We designed a program--we are not the lead agency in housing so we were to public health and partnership.,264,,
1650,0.97,11433.321,11436.491,Technically that is feasible.,264,,
1651,0.97,11436.491,11441.296,Thank you.,265,,
1652,0.97,11441.296,11455.41,The memo that you sent on Thursday has been Referenced and I appreciate the optimistic interpretation.,266,,
1653,0.97,11455.41,11457.579,It is helpful to have clarification today that there is ongoing conversation.,266,,
1654,0.97,11457.579,11468.323,The two part strategy helps for me to see that the risks that were outlined in that memo.,266,,
1655,0.97,11468.323,11471.326,They are not insurmountable.,266,,
1656,0.97,11471.326,11489.511,It was my concern--the technicality of some of these unknowns was being perceived as a barrier to overall desire to create either just care or adjust care program like a hotel willing strategy.,266,,
1657,0.97,11489.511,11503.024,It's important for folks to hear that those risks well real are not actually going to stop the city from engaging with a partnership with Kent County.,266,,
1658,0.97,11503.024,11508.897,It sounds like Kent County is committed to finding a date to be determined.,266,,
1659,0.97,11508.897,11512.534,But a date to extend just cares.,266,,
1660,0.97,11512.534,11513.869,We greatly appreciate that.,266,,
1661,0.97,11513.869,11532.654,"It sounds like the city in good partnership absent legislation that Lewis has discussed, is interested in trying to figure out a joint effort to continue to fund hotel and strategy that meets the objective and goals that we all share.",266,,
1662,0.97,11532.654,11538.093,Getting more folks out of parks in tents and into hotels.,266,,
1663,0.97,11538.093,11539.394,We've heard from Hoteliers.,266,,
1664,0.97,11539.394,11542.397,This is a partnership they like to hear.,266,,
1665,0.97,11542.397,11555.911,"I thought that part of the good news we were hearing is this One-To strategy, interpretation at risk while maybe still real is not necessarily going to be a barrier to pursue this partnership.",266,,
1666,0.97,11555.911,11576.531,If there are Federal dollars that we can recoup as a way to reimburse the city and county for these efforts that are through a just care model or--just cares are happy to engage in a competitive process.,266,,
1667,0.97,11576.531,11579.701,"If we are able to get Federal reimbursement, that would be the Cherry on top.",266,,
1668,0.97,11579.701,11608.763,Right now my understanding is the conversations have progressed from what you are sharing is that this strategy makes it so that we are not looking at the barriers or the concerns or unknowns in the Federal reimbursement process as a conservative or risk assessment analysis and instead we are saying let's go forth and Striggow--figure out a strategy.,266,,
1669,0.97,11608.763,11620.175,It's important for this program to continue in some form.,266,,
1670,0.97,11622.544,11632.954,That we think are critical and effective.,267,,
1671,0.97,11632.954,11643.665,"More broadly, you are working with the county in an overall strategy by--not the only one.",267,,
1672,0.97,11643.665,11662.584,Critical to understanding but the overall strategy looks like will be the details forthcoming on the resources available to the Federal Government directly to what is in the bill and in terms of guidance from FEMA and Ideally it becomes more flexible.,267,,
1673,0.97,11662.584,11670.091,Partnering with the county on an overall strategy knowing that's not the only component.,267,,
1674,0.97,11670.091,11677.232,And the key to getting that aligned and settled his understanding resources . that is the relevant constraint and not just risk.,267,,
1675,0.97,11677.232,11681.77,The constraints are limiting but not barriers necessarily.,267,,
1676,0.97,11681.77,11687.342,We have our own resources with flexible dollars from the government.,267,,
1677,0.97,11687.342,11704.659,I think there is general understanding that it is the case that supportive services--that supportive services offered in most programs--FEMA guidance States those won't be reimbursed.,268,,
1678,0.97,11704.659,11731.386,I think just looking at that technical and direct exclusion and applying that to the overall funding or assuming that that type of restriction would apply to the overall assistance that we want to offer to those who are in sheltered is to some degree a interpretation of what FEMA wants to reimburse.,268,,
1679,0.97,11731.386,11744.966,What I am hearing is there is the ongoing conversations with the county about extending the States . There is not a hard date where folks will line up and potentially have to leave on March 15 which is great news.,268,,
1680,0.97,11744.966,11747.135,That is the glass Half-Full.,268,,
1681,0.97,11747.135,11764.819,The rest our conversations ongoing . The ongoing conversations are what additional considerations will we have to do together to make sure this Preapproval process for Non-Congregate approach is deemed appropriate by the Feds.,268,,
1682,0.97,11764.819,11770.225,That we have a competitive process.,268,,
1683,0.97,11770.225,11774.395,Even folks and just cares said they want to do this.,268,,
1684,0.97,11774.395,11792.313,We recognize a successful model includes support services that probably won't get reimbursed by the Feds but that we have funding and other sources and a commitment to provide support services . for those that need a place to sleep and need care.,268,,
1685,0.97,11792.313,11794.115,Providing services absent Federal dollars.,268,,
1686,0.97,11794.115,11810.632,"We want to make sure we are reaching out to that population that FEMA has identified as needing to have access to shelter, the eligible . that is the vast majority of people who are currently sleeping outside fitting into those categories.",268,,
1687,0.97,11810.632,11818.573,This is where I'm feeling and you should tell me colleagues if I am reading the tea leaves wrong.,268,,
1688,0.97,11818.573,11840.295,"It feels like this one, two approach means people want to have an end date certain and we have the possibility of extending that and that there is openness to address those conditionality's that FEMA has outlined and see a more optimistic view.",268,,
1689,0.97,11840.295,11840.929,Is that fair?,268,,
1690,0.97,11840.929,11844.966,I think so.,269,,
1691,0.97,11844.966,11865.987,Fema [Indiscernible] we will have to look to other resources to do so and acknowledge the constraints we have about deploying those resources smartly.,269,,
1692,0.97,11865.987,11876.631,We want feel defeated if that is where we end up but the resources we have that have been placed.,269,,
1693,0.97,11876.631,11886.608,Any additional comments or questions for Dr. noble--director noble?,270,,
1694,0.97,11886.608,11890.144,Remarkably there is not.,270,,
1695,0.97,11890.144,11893.448,"Jeff, anything else from your end?",270,,
1696,0.97,11893.448,11894.616,Not at this time.,271,,
1697,0.97,11894.616,11908.029,I appreciate you are in the middle of these discussions and that it's hard to give finite dates or certain dollar amounts or even 100% assurance on these things.,272,,
1698,0.97,11908.029,11925.046,"I'm trying to pull out the good news . with that, we appreciate your long time today on today's Council and we will let you know . good luck with those conversations and please pass on our appreciation to the county partners.",272,,
1699,0.97,11925.046,11930.585,We have reached the end of the agenda.,273,,
1700,0.97,11930.585,11936.491,Would love to hear if there are additional items for the good of the order.,273,,
1701,0.97,11936.491,11943.097,"Hearing on, Jeff, thank you for your presentation.",273,,
1702,0.97,11943.097,11947.402,"Seeing all Councilmembers, nobody has additional comments so we are at the end of today's presentation.",273,,
1703,0.97,11947.402,11949.837,The next Finance and housing Committee on March 16 at 9:30 am.,273,,
1704,0.97,11949.837,11955.71,Look forward to getting feedback on that resolution by Thursday at noon.,273,,
1705,0.97,11955.71,11958.98,You have been generous with your time and have a great rest of your afternoon.,273,,
1706,0.97,11958.98,11961.95,Goodbye.,274,,
