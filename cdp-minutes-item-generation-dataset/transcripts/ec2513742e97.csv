30,0.97,118.818,130.563,"Good morning, Lish Whitson, council central staff . I am going to provide a little bit of context for your consideration for this proposed alley vacation.",18,,
31,0.97,130.563,155.788,"We will handed over to city departments and the petitioners . mt . Baker housing and like committee partners have petitioned the city for the vacation alley to facilitate the affordable housing project in the Judkins park neighborhood, South grand street at the Southern boundary of Council district 3. under state law is a legislative act.",18,,
32,0.97,155.788,164.764,The Council is about policies that include a two part test for street and alley vacations.,18,,
33,0.97,164.764,166.833,"First, look at whether the city is protecting the public's trust.",18,,
34,0.97,166.833,169.202,"In other words, the reasons we have streets and alleys.",18,,
35,0.97,169.202,172.539,"Second, we should look at the public access the public will provide.",18,,
36,0.97,172.539,186.819,"First test considered whether a alley is needed for any of the following reasons, circulation, access, utilities, light, air, open space, public Assembly, or Free-Speech activities.",18,,
37,0.97,186.819,192.325,"And, whether it is consistent with our Land-Use policies and urban form.",18,,
38,0.97,192.325,201.701,"Second, you should consider whether it is sufficient if it to the general public in exchange for a permanent loss to the public or public space.",18,,
39,0.97,201.701,207.44,You can consider the use of the building and benefits provided by the project but there also needs to be a long term benefit to the general public.,18,,
40,0.97,207.44,213.246,Councils review of the vacation takes place in two phases.,18,,
41,0.97,213.246,216.849,"The first is conditional approval and that is a decision, where we are today.",18,,
42,0.97,216.849,234.834,"The second, if conditional approval is granted, the project will come back to Council for final approval when all the conditions have been met . There is a public hearing scheduled for this project for this afternoon which will allow you to vote on the vacation as early as next week.",18,,
43,0.97,234.834,243.676,I will handed over to Beverly Barnett to talk about the analysis the city Department's are undertaking unless anyone has questions.,18,,
44,0.97,243.676,250.85,"Thank you, and thank you Council members.",19,,
45,0.97,250.85,260.593,We are all really appreciative of the Council setting a special time to hear this project with the way housing funds are dispersed . The timing was really difficult.,19,,
46,0.97,260.593,262.462,I think we all really greatly appreciate that.,19,,
47,0.97,262.462,264.464,I appreciate Lish's overview.,19,,
48,0.97,264.464,274.007,I am going to spend a couple of minutes covering what Sdot looked at and I also want to let you know how we will handle this morning's meeting.,19,,
49,0.97,274.007,275.608,We have Lish and then me.,19,,
50,0.97,275.608,295.295,"Next to speak is Michael Jenkins, then Mathew Richter and then Pat Foley and David tan, the joint venture partners are going to just introduce themselves and then we are going to focus the bulk of our time on the Powerpoint presentation . David is going to go over this.",19,,
51,0.97,295.295,301.034,"Natalie quick, who was also part of the team, will run the Powerpoint.",19,,
52,0.97,301.034,307.74,"We do have other staff members here that are subject matter experts so if any questions come up, we can text them and get information.",19,,
53,0.97,307.74,315.515,We have their architectural team . We have Jonathan Williams from Sdot who worked on the street improvement permit plan.,19,,
54,0.97,315.515,320.92,We think we have everybody that is needed to respond to your questions but we do really want to focus on the project.,19,,
55,0.97,320.92,328.461,My job in Sdot--Sdot administers the vacation program for the city council.,19,,
56,0.97,328.461,342.875,It is our job to review the policies and make sure that the project is consistent with our understanding of what Council wants to see.,19,,
57,0.97,342.875,345.144,"With this project, we think this is a very strong project.",19,,
58,0.97,345.144,349.382,We are really happy to recommend it and happy to move forward on their schedule.,19,,
59,0.97,349.382,351.684,There is a couple of unusual things with the public benefits.,19,,
60,0.97,351.684,358.191,You will hear from Michael about the community engagement.,19,,
61,0.97,358.191,368.267,We are going to hear from Mathew Richter about the cultural art space which may be the first one that Council has seen.,19,,
62,0.97,368.267,370.57,It is Stephanie the first space associated with a vacation.,19,,
63,0.97,370.57,384.484,"Then when we go into the Powerpoint, you will see the project design in the context of how it fits into the community and the really Large- scale, well-designed public open spaces that are being created.",19,,
64,0.97,384.484,391.824,"For a project to receive a recommendation, it needs to meet the criteria established by the city council.",19,,
65,0.97,391.824,395.695,We think this is an unusual project.,19,,
66,0.97,395.695,402.802,"One of the things you will see when we get into the Powerpoint is by vacating the alley and consolidating the site, mt.",19,,
67,0.97,402.802,412.211,"Baker housing is able to do more units of housing, less cost per unit, and are able to add more family size units.",19,,
68,0.97,412.211,418.651,That little alley really has a remarkable difference on housing that is being created.,19,,
69,0.97,418.651,423.456,"When we look at the Powerpoint, you will be able to see that.",19,,
70,0.97,423.456,429.362,"Unless there is questions for me, we really want to focus on the other bits and pieces and get to the Powerpoint.",19,,
71,0.97,429.362,433.266,We are all here and we are happy to answer anything now or later before this afternoon.,19,,
72,0.97,433.266,437.737,"Michael, I believe you are next.",19,,
73,0.97,437.737,438.337,Perfect.,20,,
74,0.97,438.337,439.772,"Good morning, Council members and thank you, Beverly.",20,,
75,0.97,439.772,448.147,Thank you to the mt . Baker team and their partners for this very interesting project that the Commission evaluated.,20,,
76,0.97,448.147,464.363,"The Commission looked at the project twice on the issues of public trust and twice on public benefits . Overall, the Commission supported the alley as not having a significant impact on the remaining Right- Of-Way.",20,,
77,0.97,464.363,479.579,"They provided adequate access for the Motors, which is a property to the South.",20,,
78,0.97,479.579,483.616,The Commission voiced their significant support for the project and the additional affordable housing that is achieved from the vacation.,20,,
79,0.97,483.616,505.471,"Of the public benefit features that will be highlighted in the presentation, I think that the Commission was most excited by and interested in how equity is being elevated in the proposed art and cultural space and the opportunities to elevate equity with the design of the Plaza and Right-Of-Way.",20,,
80,0.97,505.471,515.348,Beverly eluded to the relationship of the project with the cultural space PDA . We are thrilled with this partner.,20,,
81,0.97,515.348,543.976,"We have been meeting with Mathew Richter and the cultural space PDA and we are really excited that this particular project provides potentially a blueprint for other Street and alley vacation, focusing on art and culture as well as that reflect ever changing demographics in our neighborhood.",20,,
82,0.97,543.976,551.684,"I am going to go ahead and leave it right there, if there are any questions.",20,,
83,0.97,551.684,557.957,"Or, after you have been able to look at the presentation, ask me any questions about the Commission's interest and support are the public and if it package.",20,,
84,0.97,557.957,564.096,I think with that --,20,,
85,0.97,564.096,570.57,"Thank you, Michael, thank you Beverly.",21,,
86,0.97,570.57,581.981,"I am presenting this morning on behalf of the cultural space agency, the newest public development authority in Seattle which represents, by the square feet, the smallest piece of this whole project.",21,,
87,0.97,581.981,588.287,"We are looking at acquiring 1500 square-foot storefront in the mt . Baker housing project, right on the front of the building on Rainier Avenue.",21,,
88,0.97,588.287,597.196,We are excited to turn it into some permanently dedicated cultural space on behalf of community.,21,,
89,0.97,597.196,621.554,"This is space that since Memorial has been indigenous Ultural space and that over the course of the last 150 years, this is a neighborhood that has really accepted multiple waves of immigration from Italian farming immigration at the Turn-Of-The- century through Japanese communities that came to town through this neighborhood, Vietnamese population has swelled in 1970s.",21,,
90,0.97,621.554,630.93,Urbanizing Latinx population and most recently a burgeoning Somali community in this neighborhood as well.,21,,
91,0.97,630.93,641.273,"Now that housing is expanding and Seattle is growing, we are looking at trying to ensure the retention of these cultural communities in this neighborhood.",21,,
92,0.97,641.273,652.418,What the space agency intends to do is create what we believe to be the first permanently dedicated pop up space in the United States.,21,,
93,0.97,652.418,681.514,"This would be 1500 square feet of retail space that would be a series of culturally representative pop up project's whether those are Micro businesses or arts projects directly, small galleries, performance spaces in this storefront that would rotate every three months, every six months but it would be permanently dedicated and Curated by the cultural space agency.",21,,
94,0.97,681.514,682.848,It is a super exciting opportunity.,21,,
95,0.97,682.848,691.691,It is a beautiful project and we are excited to be a part of it . I also will be here and happy to answer any questions about the project.,21,,
96,0.97,691.691,699.598,"With that, I believe I pass it to David tan.",21,,
97,0.97,699.598,716.649,"Next we are going to have Pat Foley from Lake Union partners and David Tan introduce themselves and then we will move into the Powerpoint so Natalie can start Prepping the Powerpoint . either Patrick or David, if you want to do a quick Intro and then we will move to the Powerpoint.",22,,
98,0.97,716.649,722.955,"Go ahead first, David.",23,,
99,0.97,722.955,726.759,"Good morning and thank you very much, Council, for the opportunity to appear in front of you today.",24,,
100,0.97,726.759,727.626,I am David tan.,24,,
101,0.97,727.626,755.187,"I am the executive director of mt . Baker housing . We are in partnership with Lake Union partners on grand Street Commons and I must say that Matthew has highlighted, in addition to the housing, one of the most exciting things for us about this space and this project, I happen to be a musical artist . I am looking forward to the pop up space that the cultural space agency is going to be placing in our project.",24,,
102,0.97,755.187,783.082,"I am going to hand it over to Pat Foley but before I do that, I want to mention that Lake Union partners and mt . Baker have entered into a department partnership with grand Street Commons, which I believe could potentially be a model for the future . This is a really exciting one for us . I would love for Pat to expand on that.",24,,
103,0.97,783.082,786.318,Thank you for allowing us the opportunity to be here today.,25,,
104,0.97,786.318,790.189,This is our second project of this nature.,25,,
105,0.97,790.189,799.298,"This was a contaminated site, where for the last three years, we have been looking with the Department of Ecology in the community.",25,,
106,0.97,799.298,804.136,"We cleaned a site which now is allowing us, as a private developer working with mt.",25,,
107,0.97,804.136,811.944,"Baker housing, to deliver 775 units of affordable housing.",25,,
108,0.97,811.944,816.549,Almost 50% of which will be affordable . We are super excited about that.,25,,
109,0.97,816.549,854.486,Our first project in the central area will be partnered with community housing and community land trust and a very similar 50% across the entire block will be affordable . We have a strong focus on community commercial shops and retail that are affordable and that allows us to recruit the types of businesses that the neighborhood want . We are excited about the ability to deliver this much affordable housing at this location.,25,,
110,0.97,854.486,872.805,"David, it looks like you are on mute . I think now we are ready for the Powerpoint . If Natalie can share her screen, we will go to the Powerpoint and of course respond to any questions throughout or at the end.",26,,
111,0.97,872.805,876.108,Thank you.,27,,
112,0.97,876.108,886.418,The first slide here is a general rendition of what grand Street Commons will look like.,27,,
113,0.97,886.418,890.522,I want to mention this again.,27,,
114,0.97,890.522,910.242,It is a ground field site that has been cleaned with the Department of Ecology . one of the benefits of this kind of Codevelopment partnership is creating a very coherent and beneficial development for the neighborhood.,27,,
115,0.97,910.242,916.215,This first slide is representative of what it will look like.,27,,
116,0.97,916.215,938.47,"That car you see there is moving more along Ranier . If you go to the next slide, this one gives us a--Natalie, if you could possibly move to the next slide.",27,,
117,0.97,938.47,941.073,Perhaps we are having a little bit of technical difficulty.,27,,
118,0.97,941.073,956.288,The next slide is a general overview of the region with the three blocks that are being developed highlighted.,27,,
119,0.97,956.288,971.303,Maybe we can get to those . one of the things that I would point out is--there we go.,27,,
120,0.97,971.303,976.709,This is an overview of the site location.,27,,
121,0.97,976.709,985.184,You can see Rainier Avenue South running along would be the left or West side of this piece of property.,27,,
122,0.97,985.184,986.418,Grant Street runs through the middle.,27,,
123,0.97,986.418,994.727,"There is a slide, which I believe is the next one, which shows--Nope, it is the one actually before this one.",27,,
124,0.97,994.727,995.728,There we go.,27,,
125,0.97,995.728,1005.237,"This slide shows, in red, the little line running through grand Street Commons South.",27,,
126,0.97,1005.237,1037.369,"That is the alley we are requesting to be vacated . If we can go to the next slide after the next slide, the overall vision for this property is shown there but the highlight here, as Patrick mentioned, the number of residential units that this project is designed to provide and the number of affordable units that will be a part of the project.",27,,
127,0.97,1037.369,1058.49,"You can see grand Street Commons South is mt . Baker housing's portion of the project and 100% of our units will be Affordale . more importantly, for the overall project, nearly 50% of those 775 units will be affordable.",27,,
128,0.97,1058.49,1064.396,"Natalie, if we could move to the next slide.",27,,
129,0.97,1064.396,1066.999,This is a general overview of the project information.,28,,
130,0.97,1066.999,1076.375,"Rather than read everything here, I will leave this slide for a few moments and give you an opportunity to view it.",28,,
131,0.97,1076.375,1083.015,"If you have any questions, I can try to answer them.",28,,
132,0.97,1083.015,1092.257,"If there are no questions, if we could move to the next slide.",28,,
133,0.97,1092.257,1093.025,"Sorry, David.",29,,
134,0.97,1093.025,1095.627,I see a question from Councilmember Morales.,29,,
135,0.97,1095.627,1096.095,I apologize.,30,,
136,0.97,1096.095,1096.495,Go ahead.,30,,
137,0.97,1096.495,1104.436,"It is a broader question not about this slide in particular and it might be a question for Beverly but I am interested, especially in the Right-Of-Way.",31,,
138,0.97,1104.436,1115.147,Some of the slides a little further in the Appendix--it looks like there is a big driveway that will be coming in.,31,,
139,0.97,1115.147,1120.452,Maybe that is grand street.,31,,
140,0.97,1120.452,1153.952,"Given how busy Rainier Avenue is and how fast people drive down that road, I am interested to know what kind of Right-Of- way improvements will be made and if there will be any Crosswalks added . If you are adding 700 units here for people presumably to walk up to the Light-Rail station that is coming in, or to move down into the neighborhood, I am wondering if there is any plan to add some Crosswalks near this project.",31,,
141,0.97,1153.952,1155.187,That is a great question.,32,,
142,0.97,1155.187,1157.189,"Beverly, would you like to --",32,,
143,0.97,1157.189,1157.589,Yeah.,33,,
144,0.97,1157.589,1162.628,"Councilmember, that might be a little more evident when we get a little further into the presentation.",33,,
145,0.97,1162.628,1194.393,"If you are looking at the grand Street connection to Rainier, it is proposed to be a one-way pedestrian character . E the it will be narrower to slow traffic down . It will be a Herbalists street . that design has been reviewed by Sdot and by our traffic operations and based on the traffic volumes, have approved that.",33,,
146,0.97,1194.393,1208.14,"It is in the final, final design but what you are looking at really is a different vision of Grand street . It is not a driveway.",33,,
147,0.97,1208.14,1210.442,Okay.,34,,
148,0.97,1210.442,1211.243,Please go on.,34,,
149,0.97,1211.243,1215.914,I'm sure I will have more questions.,34,,
150,0.97,1215.914,1221.019,"Natalie, if you could move to the next slide.",35,,
151,0.97,1221.019,1224.856,This is a slide which shows the impact of the alley vacation.,35,,
152,0.97,1224.856,1249.848,"In the upper left-hand corner, you can see the alley as it is now . If it were not vacated, on our block, on the mt . Baker housing block, we would be limited to creating a two building project . with the alley gone, we can create a one building project.",35,,
153,0.97,1249.848,1252.084,"The benefit of that is two things, really.",35,,
154,0.97,1252.084,1260.993,"First of all, without the alley vacation, we would only be able to provide 160 units of affordable housing.",35,,
155,0.97,1260.993,1266.298,"With the alley vacation and a single building, we can do 206, or 50 more approximately.",35,,
156,0.97,1266.298,1281.313,"Another huge benefit here of the alley vacation would be the cost per unit, which would drop significantly by about $64,000 per unit.",35,,

158,0.97,1285.784,1296.128,"This project and this design, with the guidance of the Department of neighborhoods, has gone through some significant and required community engagement.",35,,
159,0.97,1296.128,1300.432,The community engagement started a number of years ago in 2019.,35,,
160,0.97,1300.432,1309.741,I want to point out that the photograph literally is from one of the early community engagement meetings.,35,,
161,0.97,1309.741,1313.211,I do want to point out that this was before the pandemic.,35,,
162,0.97,1313.211,1320.519,There are a lot of people wandering around in that room with no masks but this was from October 2019.,35,,
163,0.97,1320.519,1337.369,"The engagement plan was actually quite successful, however, even though we went through 2020 as it was . one of the things that mt . Baker and Lake Union partners did with some help was create a Website.",35,,
164,0.97,1337.369,1355.687,"You can see that there was significant traffic on the Website . We received a large number of the comments to the project, most of which and many of which you have responded to.",35,,
165,0.97,1355.687,1358.49,"If we could go to the next slide, that would be appreciated.",35,,
166,0.97,1358.49,1364.396,This is an overview of the public benefits.,35,,
167,0.97,1364.396,1401.133,"I don't want to go through this and read every word but I do want to highlight that in the middle there, you can see the thing that Michael and Matthew highlighted, the art and cultural opportunities and the communities space, agency use of mt . Baker housing's 1500 square feet on our commercial site for the Pop-Up . If there are any questions here, we can also respond to them now.",35,,
168,0.97,1401.133,1403.602,"Thank you, David.",36,,
169,0.97,1403.602,1409.307,"Colleagues, any questions?",36,,
170,0.97,1409.307,1423.455,"If not, Natalie, we can move to the next and begin to look at some of the Right-Of-Way benefits.",37,,
171,0.97,1423.455,1438.57,You can see grand Street does runoff of Rainier Avenue South but it is quite narrow which will slow traffic a great deal.,37,,
172,0.97,1438.57,1460.492,"These are the locations where there are Right-Of-Way benefits with landscaping . You can see in the bottom left-hand corner the commercial space, which the community space agency will be taking, is on that corner, so facing Rainier Avenue South.",37,,
173,0.97,1460.492,1468.6,Out in front of that space is public gathering space.,37,,
174,0.97,1468.6,1470.569,You can see the public Plaza and Right-Of-Way there.,37,,
175,0.97,1470.569,1489.287,"In the bottom right-hand corner of this slide, the grand Street one-way Street will be a very slow, Herbalists Street and it is also Walkable.",37,,
176,0.97,1489.287,1495.026,This is a more detailed vision of the Plaza.,37,,
177,0.97,1495.026,1502.667,"Natalie, if you could possibly show where the water feature would be just above grand street.",37,,
178,0.97,1502.667,1505.604,There we go.,37,,
179,0.97,1505.604,1508.607,"Again, you can see there is a significant amount of walking space.",37,,
180,0.97,1508.607,1518.95,"In addition, 22nd Avenue South extension from the top--there we go.",37,,
181,0.97,1518.95,1524.656,In the top of that space it leads to the Judkins park Light- rail station.,37,,
182,0.97,1524.656,1526.525,I might pop in here for a minute.,38,,
183,0.97,1526.525,1530.161,This is Beverly again from the Fdot perspective.,38,,
184,0.97,1530.161,1552.183,"In looking at this, the idea to have grand Street be one way was intended to still provide for accommodation for the three blocks but to slow the traffic down and make sure that this is emphasizing the pedestrian character of the environment.",38,,
185,0.97,1552.183,1562.06,The staff and Sdot looked at --,38,,
186,0.97,1562.06,1563.528,Beverly may have frozen.,39,,
187,0.97,1563.528,1570.201,-- design features.,40,,
188,0.97,1570.201,1579.11,"Beverly, you cut out midway through there but I think we got your point.",41,,
189,0.97,1579.11,1580.111,Councilmember Morales has another question.,41,,
190,0.97,1580.111,1581.98,"Thank you, Mr. President.",42,,
191,0.97,1581.98,1589.487,"I certainly appreciate what you just said, Beverly.",42,,
192,0.97,1589.487,1601.232,"I am really excited about the cultural space agency, about the space that is here and the Vibe that this could bring to the area.",42,,
193,0.97,1601.232,1603.902,I think it is beautiful.,42,,
194,0.97,1603.902,1611.009,"What I am still worried about, though, is not necessarily grand Street but Rainier.",42,,
195,0.97,1611.009,1623.021,"If the intention is to create a pedestrian friendly space here, it is literally on a very unfriendly suite for pedestrians.",42,,
196,0.97,1623.021,1647.345,"My real question is about what improvements will be required of the developers on the sidewalk along Rainier, Croswalks for people moving in and out of this space . There is a lot happening here . If the intention is to bring people who are walking, they may be very safe inside the space but all around it, they won't be.",42,,
197,0.97,1647.345,1648.98,That is my real question.,42,,
198,0.97,1648.98,1653.251,What does the perimeter around this?,42,,
199,0.97,1653.251,1657.055,What requirements will be made to improve the infrastructure and the perimeter of this space?,42,,
200,0.97,1657.055,1664.996,Sdot is looking at pedestrian improvements at 23rd and at Rainier.,43,,
201,0.97,1664.996,1692.223,"The project itself does not trigger the requirements to do a Signalized crossing at Rainier Avenue South . We are looking at what other kinds of pedestrian enhancements can be required but around the two blocks to the North and on the mt . Baker site, developers are always responsible for doing a code required improvement around the site.",43,,
202,0.97,1692.223,1712.143,"This project just did not trigger a signal at Rainier Avenue South . I think that is something we are still looking at, what enhancements can be.",43,,
203,0.97,1712.143,1726.357,"There will be conduits put in place so when a signal is triggered, it can be put in more readily . I think the Commission did look at this.",43,,
204,0.97,1726.357,1728.56,It looks like Michael wants to add something on that too.,43,,
205,0.97,1728.56,1730.562,You beat me to the punch.,44,,
206,0.97,1730.562,1752.584,"Councilmember Mireles, there was significant discussion by the Commission looking at the balance of--because there is not a requirement triggering the improvement, there was a lot of discussion about the relative cost of signal Lysing and even if they signaled intersection or crossing.",44,,
207,0.97,1752.584,1756.187,"Excuse me, it could be permitted because of the nature of the arterial.",44,,
208,0.97,1756.187,1783.615,"The relevant cost weighed against some of the other commitments that they were able to make to the Plaza, now to the cultural space PDA, certainly the Commission explored that with them . Thank you for reminding us that there is a Conduit improvement to the North that would allow for a Signalized crossing when Sdot APPROVES a warrant for that.",44,,
209,0.97,1783.615,1791.99,The sidewalk on Rainier will be widened to 8 feet.,45,,
210,0.97,1791.99,1795.193,"It does create a pedestrian environment, just that sense of dimension.",45,,
211,0.97,1795.193,1802.367,The entirety of the design on the site is intended to create a place for pedestrians.,45,,
212,0.97,1802.367,1815.547,"The design of the Plaza certainly needs to look at sounds, noise, the volumes from Rainier but it is part of being in an urban neighborhood.",45,,
213,0.97,1815.547,1818.55,Thank you.,46,,
214,0.97,1818.55,1820.318,That is very helpful information.,46,,
215,0.97,1820.318,1824.055,"Councilmember Morales, do you have a follow-up?",46,,
216,0.97,1824.055,1828.359,Thank you for those questions.,46,,
217,0.97,1828.359,1835.266,"Colleagues, we have five minutes left scheduled for this presentation . I just want to check in to see if we have other questions at this time.",46,,
218,0.97,1835.266,1836.634,Councilmember Mosqueda?,46,,

222,0.97,1849.28,1857.388,I will be fighting an amendment for our consideration this afternoon so I wanted to make sure that I was in Q for when the presentation rounds out.,47,,
223,0.97,1857.388,1863.361,"If you would like to take other questions about the presentation, I just wanted to let colleagues know.",47,,
224,0.97,1863.361,1867.165,You should have heard from my office as well midweek last week about the amendments.,47,,
225,0.97,1867.165,1873.671,Happy to talk about this morning as a preview for this afternoon.,47,,
226,0.97,1873.671,1879.11,"Just as I am stepping into the role of Council President pro Tem, it is my understanding we will have a public hearing this afternoon.",48,,
227,0.97,1879.11,1881.98,I thought we were voting next week? are we voting today?,48,,

234,0.97,1897.629,1902.934,We had a similar presentation at our transportation committee several months ago.,49,,
235,0.97,1902.934,1905.336,It is very thorough.,49,,
236,0.97,1905.336,1923.688,"Just because it is a vacation of an Alleyway, they normally go through the transportation committee but in this case because we don't want to slow down the production of any affordable housing, I appreciate the accommodation to have this briefing today and public hearing this afternoon.",49,,
237,0.97,1923.688,1925.056,We will vote on it next week.,49,,
238,0.97,1925.056,1932.764,I am supportive of this vacation of the alley . I don't do that lightly.,49,,
239,0.97,1932.764,1940.338,"I want to maximize public benefit whenever we are giving something up that is the city's . In this case, the alley.",49,,
240,0.97,1940.338,1944.175,"However, the public and if it's here seem very thorough.",49,,
241,0.97,1944.175,1949.847,"Obviously, only half of the units will be low income, it is a lot of units.",49,,
242,0.97,1949.847,1951.783,It is 360 affordable units.,49,,
243,0.97,1951.783,1977.075,"I am pleased to see it at 60% of area median income which is appropriate and necessary to support low income residents . I am happy to work with, as Judkins park station opens in a couple of years a few blocks to the North and then we have mt.",49,,
244,0.97,1977.075,1992.423,"Baker Light-Rail station to the South, I am happy to work with Councilmember Morales and Sawant to make sure we are getting people safely to those Light-Rail station's . They are walking safely there . I just want to provide that additional context.",49,,

253,0.97,2031.062,2040.238,Amendment number one that we will be bringing before you is discussed on page 5 of the central staff memo.,53,,
254,0.97,2040.238,2045.476,This amendment would remove the requirement that grand Street partners pay the appraised value for the Allie space.,53,,
255,0.97,2045.476,2055.019,Adopting the amendment would reduce the city's cost to develop affordable housing on site by hundred thousand dollars.,53,,
256,0.97,2055.019,2072.904,Our overall goal here is to create affordable housing and to make sure every penny goes back into the public grid as was just discussed . I believe this amendment is one part of a larger conversation that we will soon be having about how we can create more opportunity for Thoe precious dollars to go directly into building affordable housing.,53,,
257,0.97,2072.904,2082.079,This amendment to this individual Street vacation is a precursor to legislation my office will be working on with Lish Whitson.,53,,
258,0.97,2082.079,2096.527,I want to thank the chair transportation as well for the conversations with our office about how to create an assumption for all city afforded housing projects.,53,,
259,0.97,2096.527,2111.943,We will remove an internal barrier for affordable housing and allow us to save Russia's affordable housing money that could be used for more homes pick this amendment Aligns with legislation that I sponsored back in 2018 that Prioritized city-owned surplus property for affordable housing.,53,,
260,0.97,2111.943,2135.666,"This was the surpass plan that folks remember that removed--and asked our city to preserve affordable housing opportunities on publicly owned land and when those surplus properties have offered it to other city departments and when they are not interested, to offer those who develop affordable housing so that we can preserve public good on public spaces.",53,,
261,0.97,2135.666,2153.451,"I removing hefty fees associated with the charges associated with the needing to acquire the area of the city owned rights-of-way, then we are able to advance our goal of creating more affordable housing.",53,,
262,0.97,2153.451,2161.092,I think that this will be a more efficient and effective way to remove any unnecessary processes associated with transferring city funds right back to the city.,53,,
263,0.97,2161.092,2179.377,Appreciate the ongoing conversation that we have been having with individuals who are represented here from the various departments and city departments as well to help remove the required pay Street vacation fees making sure that limited public housing dollars go right back into building affordable housing.,53,,
264,0.97,2179.377,2196.027,"I will save the rest of my comments for this afternoon but I do want to thank all of the conversations about how to remove specific to this property allowing for $400,000 to be invested right back into affordable housing.",53,,

451,0.97,3881.577,3893.522,"And all struggles, this will depend on organization and activism of themselves and how they build solidarity across the community.",77,,

454,0.97,3910.339,3925.655,"That legislation was returned unsigned by the Mayor on October 8 one month ago which means that as of today, it should be in effect . If I am wrong about that, I hope the clerk or somebody from central staff will correct me.",77,,

457,0.97,3945.174,3956.552,On today's introduction and referral calendar is a legislation from my office that I briefly mentioned during Council briefing last Monday.,77,,
458,0.97,3956.552,3964.26,"Mayor Durkan has issued an emergency order to reinstate hiring bonuses of up to $25,000 for police officers.",77,,
459,0.97,3964.26,3979.709,"Ironically, her excuse for this emergency order to give police even more money is the Covid-19 emergency . Her argument is that because many police officers are endangering the public by refusing to be Vaccinated or wear masks, they need to be given more money.",77,,
460,0.97,3979.709,3984.513,Essentially that is the argument.,77,,
461,0.97,3984.513,3989.485,The Mayor is showing a shocking double standard when she advocates for hiring bonuses in the Seattle police Department.,77,,
462,0.97,3989.485,3999.195,"The police are some of the highest paid people, making more than double what is paid to social workers like homeless service workers.",77,,
463,0.97,3999.195,4007.77,"The Mayor has claimed in the past that she will not open, shelters and tiny House villages because there are not enough homeless service workers to staff.",77,,
464,0.97,4007.77,4016.412,That is because they're not being paid nearly enough so that they can survive without the experience.,77,,
465,0.97,4016.412,4032.061,"For years, the Seattle police Department has used the contract as excuse for failing to hold our office is accountable and yet here we are in the middle of the contract negotiations with the police officers Guild and the Mayor is offering the police extra money without accountability.",77,,
466,0.97,4032.061,4033.396,We have to address the situation.,77,,
467,0.97,4033.396,4042.071,We also have to remember that the amount of police funding does not have any statistical impact on the amount of crime in a community.,77,,
468,0.97,4042.071,4052.381,It is reducing inequality and providing affordable housing and limiting wage jobs and affordable services including Childcare that has the greatest statistical impact.,77,,
469,0.97,4052.381,4077.406,"I share the concerns that ordinary people have about the rise in gun violence . If you look at the data, you will see this has been happening even though the police budget has been loaded for many years while the social services and affordable housing with working people in our community and the poor need continue to be gravely and underfunded when rents are being skyrocketed by corporate landlords.",77,,
470,0.97,4077.406,4096.492,We need a community oversight committee with power over the police . The legislation from my office that is on today's introduction and referral calendar will Mortify the Mayor's executive order to not implement police hiring bonuses that this council voted on in September against implementing twice.,77,,

476,0.97,4129.225,4137.132,I do not see a value in that two-week delay but it is also only two weeks so I am willing to accept it.,77,,
477,0.97,4137.132,4142.204,"In my view, this emergency order is a terrible misuse of city resources that should be used for affordable housing and investing in our community.",77,,
478,0.97,4142.204,4168.998,"I am done with my report but I will also note, Council President pro Tem Strauss, that I find it really unfortunate that you chose to interrupt my comments when I was reporting to the elected legislative body of our city how senior tenants, senior tenants of color, faith leaders of color and community members are struggling for the very basic rights have been intimidated and facing Harassment by the landlord.",77,,
