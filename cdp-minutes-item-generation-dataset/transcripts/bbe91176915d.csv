170,0.97,975.841,985.384,We had one in the U district but that had to shut down because the church we were renting from sold their building.,46,,
171,0.97,985.384,994.226,We also in terms of relatively new line of business we have 17 tiny House villages.,46,,

180,0.97,1052.484,1065.831,"Because there were serious problems with shelters, hotels and tiny House villages were seen as a way of addressing Coviz and protecting people.",46,,
181,0.97,1065.831,1073.205,"One of them, executive Pacific had 155 rooms which we operated for ten months.",46,,
182,0.97,1073.205,1092.758,I think that what was significant was that we were able to work with the hope team and prior NAV team and House people who were outside on public right of ways in parks.,46,,
183,0.97,1092.758,1112.678,We wanted to let you know that during this period of time we also had behavioral health on site with therapy health services and then a program called rapid Rehousing that was separately contracted with the human services Department.,46,,

187,0.97,1121.453,1127.459,We only had the hotel open for 10 months and served 122 people.,46,,
188,0.97,1127.459,1140.639,Then we had to close down end of January and we had a ramp down where we had to move out approximately 100 people very quickly because that was the contract.,46,,
189,0.97,1140.639,1145.844,The Mayor's office and Das made with the hotel provider.,46,,
190,0.97,1145.844,1156.355,"Our staff Scrambld and we were able to get emergency housing vouchers but we also had to free up a lot of housing that we, you know that we own ourselves.",46,,
191,0.97,1156.355,1170.002,"So, in the ramp down we moved 93% of the people into permanent housing which was pretty, I think a high--a high accomplishment.",46,,
192,0.97,1170.002,1177.609,"73% went into permanent supportive housing and others, 20% went into other types of housing, permanent housing.",46,,
193,0.97,1177.609,1183.382,Very few people actually went into rapid Rehousing or got housing through rapid Rehousing.,46,,
194,0.97,1183.382,1185.35,Even though that was the major strategy.,46,,
195,0.97,1185.35,1202.668,I think that all of us including the human services Department and others saw that there was not a good service match between the people that were in the executive Pacific hotel and the rapid Rehousing program.,46,,
196,0.97,1202.668,1217.583,We depended on emergency housing vouchers from the Rha and then we also moved a lot of people from executive Pacific hotel into our housing as well as other nonprofit and private market housing.,46,,
197,0.97,1217.583,1222.321,We only had one person in the ramp down who refused to engage.,46,,
198,0.97,1222.321,1229.127,We were able to have her case managers work with everybody else and we had a very successful outcome.,46,,
199,0.97,1229.127,1237.135,"There is a report that we are happy to share with you later about the ramp down, how that took place.",46,,
200,0.97,1237.135,1261.627,"It was a--I would say it was a big pilot test of renting a hotel and then having to move everybody out and, you know, I think the cost of--I would say just in terms of my editor comment, the cost we spent renting the hotel we could have purchased a hotel.",46,,
201,0.97,1261.627,1262.06,Next slide.,46,,
202,0.97,1262.06,1275.273,Rapid housing acquisition is something I really want to thank the Council for because this would not have been possible if you had not put in jump start.,46,,
203,0.97,1275.273,1284.349,This made it possible to provide matching funds so we were able to basically purchase six brand new buildings.,46,,
204,0.97,1284.349,1308.473,There was a Recessin and developers who wanted to sell their properties instead of keeping them and maintaining them so Lihi purchased four properties and then we help chief Seattle purchase more.,46,,
205,0.97,1308.473,1312.778,The buildings are in beacon Hill and Capitol Hill.,46,,
206,0.97,1312.778,1315.981,The chief Seattle Club building just closed last week.,46,,
207,0.97,1315.981,1318.784,This is very exciting.,46,,
208,0.97,1318.784,1327.359,We ended up with 333 units of basically brand new.,46,,
209,0.97,1327.359,1328.46,Can I jump?,47,,
210,0.97,1328.46,1334.933,Can you clarify whether the dock side that we were at yesterday for the press conference is included in this or is that in.,47,,
211,0.97,1334.933,1337.369,That would be in addition.,48,,
212,0.97,1337.369,1337.703,If addition.,48,,
213,0.97,1337.703,1338.537,That's great.,49,,
214,0.97,1338.537,1341.84,That's the answer I was hoping to hear.,49,,
215,0.97,1341.84,1342.207,That's great.,49,,
216,0.97,1342.207,1342.441,Sorry.,49,,
217,0.97,1342.441,1342.708,Continue.,49,,
218,0.97,1342.708,1357.889,We wanted to add a slide but it was--the slide had already--you had already put it up in terms of Thea again the agenda.,50,,
219,0.97,1357.889,1364.763,The next slide is the six we purchased and then dock side is the next one and that will include 70 units.,50,,
220,0.97,1364.763,1367.733,What you see is Harvard law office.,50,,
221,0.97,1367.733,1369.034,The photograph.,50,,
222,0.97,1369.034,1371.136,The previous picture was the clay apartments.,50,,
223,0.97,1371.136,1376.174,This is a--sort of a national model.,50,,
224,0.97,1376.174,1381.012,Most communities are purchasing like older hotels and trying to Repurpose them.,50,,
225,0.97,1381.012,1390.255,"Then it's, you know it's expensive and hotels have their own issues.",50,,
226,0.97,1390.255,1405.303,"This is we are buying new studio apartments and then we are able to modify them like some of the rooms now case management offices, some are live in staff.",50,,
227,0.97,1405.303,1411.81,This is a great strategy we want to share with other people nationwide.,50,,
228,0.97,1411.81,1417.849,Councilmember Louis was there yesterday when we basically Showcased the dock side apartments at green Lake.,50,,
229,0.97,1417.849,1419.451,That is a mixed model.,50,,
230,0.97,1419.451,1426.858,That will have 70 units of permanent supportive housing and 22 units of work force housing.,50,,
231,0.97,1431.563,1435.867,We invite you to come and tour Dodge side.,50,,
232,0.97,1435.867,1438.47,We are very pleased about this.,50,,
233,0.97,1438.47,1443.308,I think Councilmember Herbold has a question.,51,,
234,0.97,1443.308,1444.409,I do.,52,,
235,0.97,1444.409,1444.843,Thank you.,52,,
236,0.97,1444.843,1452.25,As it relates to the building that were rapid--purchased funds provided by [inaudible] through jump start.,52,,
237,0.97,1452.25,1461.193,"Were they all new buildings or were some of them occupied with residents and if so, wondering how you handled that transition?",52,,
238,0.97,1461.193,1474.94,I know a lot of times these buildings when they are occupied have a lot of deferred maintenance and there is also the question of income eligibility change was new populations of tenants.,52,,
239,0.97,1474.94,1496.661,"These were all brand new building that were in the process of getting their certificate of occupancy or sometimes, you know, they had their certificate so we did not have any existing residents.",53,,
240,0.97,1496.661,1502.2,New that's folk who purchased them decided they didn't want to operate because of the down turn?,54,,
241,0.97,1502.2,1502.634,Yeah.,55,,
242,0.97,1502.634,1525.724,"I think what happened is that with the pandemic the projected rents, were hoping to get market rate rents were slipping which meant that as investors they would have to put in more Quity and interest rates were sort of going up a little bit and so they would rather make a sale and of course you know we inspected the buildings.",55,,
243,0.97,1525.724,1531.696,We did look at two buildings in West Seattle.,55,,
244,0.97,1531.696,1531.897,Yeah.,55,,
245,0.97,1531.897,1536.034,We would like to do more rap I acquisition buildings in West Seattle.,55,,
246,0.97,1536.034,1538.336,Come talk to me.,56,,
247,0.97,1538.336,1540.071,Thank you.,57,,
248,0.97,1540.071,1549.347,"So, these are the buildings you can see and then dock side there is another round that the state is making available.",58,,
249,0.97,1549.347,1551.016,The applications will be due this summer.,58,,
250,0.97,1551.016,1554.219,There is another round of rapid acquisition.,58,,
251,0.97,1554.219,1560.358,To the extent that I think that we can free up additional jump start money.,58,,
252,0.97,1560.358,1562.794,Then you can leverage the money as well.,58,,
253,0.97,1562.794,1571.002,There's another round of housing trust fund money available.,58,,
254,0.97,1571.002,1571.303,Next slide.,58,,
255,0.97,1571.303,1592.657,The other thing we did is not--rapid acquisition but Councilmember Herbold this is exactly an example where we actually worked to purchase this existing building that's fully occupied that was at risk of being Gentrified and the residents displaced.,58,,
256,0.97,1592.657,1594.392,It's Squire park Plaza.,58,,
257,0.97,1594.392,1596.061,It's 1700 South Jackson.,58,,
258,0.97,1596.061,1605.303,"In this case, the owner had put it on the market for national investors to purchase.",58,,
259,0.97,1605.303,1613.044,"So, we got a bridge loan from a foundation and a nonprofit.",58,,
260,0.97,1613.044,1624.222,"We preserved 60 units and majority of the households, family was children, as well as Singles or people of color.",58,,
261,0.97,1624.222,1625.924,Majority or African American households.,58,,
262,0.97,1625.924,1639.504,This building we were able to get our state legislators to award us 3 million in the state budget and we are hope that the opposite housing will helps and then we will get private financing.,58,,
263,0.97,1639.504,1645.977,This is a--a partnership we had with Reverand Jeffrey with the new hope community development Institute.,58,,
264,0.97,1645.977,1661.559,This is a--this is the story that will happen over and over in the central area and Southeast where existing owners will put their building up for sale and it'll end up with people being displaced.,58,,
265,0.97,1661.559,1665.697,We would love to have of a resource for existing housing.,58,,
266,0.97,1665.697,1667.966,Chair.,59,,
267,0.97,1667.966,1669.601,Yeah.,60,,
268,0.97,1669.601,1671.403,Of course.,60,,
269,0.97,1671.403,1671.903,Councilmember Morales.,60,,
270,0.97,1671.903,1679.811,The first is can you tell us if these acquisitions were for market rate or below market?,60,,
271,0.97,1679.811,1688.153,"That's one question and then if I could understand a little more about this acquisition program, how it works.",60,,
272,0.97,1688.153,1697.662,"Are there financial criteria that, whoever comes in to apply needs to be ready to purchase, you now, like what are the steps to be able to participate in that accusation fund program?",60,,
273,0.97,1697.662,1698.196,Yeah.,61,,
274,0.97,1698.196,1704.169,I think for many years many of us are used to the standard traditional housing trust fund program.,61,,
275,0.97,1704.169,1712.61,"The housing trust fund program has like one deadline, once a year and it includes new construction, preservation.",61,,
276,0.97,1712.61,1746.878,"The rapid accusation program was set up mainly during the pandemic because the state also got significant Arpa funds or Covid relief funds and they combine it with their Capitol budget and the idea was that it was supposed to create new units like brand new units which meant that you were buying hotels and converting them or you are buying new buildings or you are--if it's possible to do a quick Remodel, but basically if you had to renovate--if you had to spend more than 940 days to renovate you are not eligible.",61,,
277,0.97,1746.878,1761.025,The idea is as quickly as possible get as many housing units or in some cases enhanced shelter beds available to the community as quickly as possible.,61,,
278,0.97,1761.025,1765.73,"The housing essentially had an open round, like a first come first serve open round.",61,,
279,0.97,1765.73,1785.617,"The round is--you know available ask then they under write the project and they provide matching funds so, the city was able to leverage like, you know, basically each project had 50% city funds, 50% state funds that.",61,,
280,0.97,1785.617,1794.325,"Saved a lot of city resources that otherwise, you know Wow have had to put in if the state wasn't--you know wasn't a major player.",61,,
281,0.97,1794.325,1809.307,It was very cost effective for the city to participate in this program and this year Senator frock and Theringer the Capitol budget has the largest amount for rapid acquisition.,61,,
282,0.97,1809.307,1809.674,Okay.,62,,
283,0.97,1809.674,1809.908,Great.,62,,
284,0.97,1809.908,1815.113,And then were you able to purchase them below market or did you have to pay market?,62,,
285,0.97,1815.113,1820.618,We purchased below market.,63,,
286,0.97,1820.618,1822.32,They were all subject to appraisal.,63,,
287,0.97,1822.32,1832.864,"They--and then we had to make sure they met inspection, inspection standards.",63,,
288,0.97,1832.864,1833.064,Yeah.,63,,
289,0.97,1833.064,1834.933,Thank you.,64,,
290,0.97,1834.933,1849.781,"So, next slide is we have camp second chance expansion and we want to thank Councilmember Herbold because this was in the budget and amazingly we now have sewer connection.",65,,
291,0.97,1849.781,1862.827,"We have a Hygeine trailer and we have expanded with 20 tiny house and so you have made this place much more Liveable and thank you so, please come out and visit.",65,,
292,0.97,1862.827,1873.805,We will have a--an opening expansion celebration sometime this afternoon.,65,,
293,0.97,1873.805,1875.573,Next slide.,66,,
294,0.97,1875.573,1879.077,"Sorry, Councilmember Herbold has a question.",67,,
295,0.97,1879.077,1908.573,I understand that the new units that are going to be available at camp second chance may be something that we should look at for Pairing with some of the actions being put forth by the executive as it relates to a particular location where the city is going to be enforcing the 72 hour parking ordinance.,68,,
296,0.97,1908.573,1925.923,So I just want to flag--I understand that Rv residents have separate barriers and challenges to accepting opportunities like those offered at camp second chance or enhanced shelter.,68,,
297,0.97,1925.923,1947.645,"I am interested in trying to do that sort of--that sort of Pairing, the city has given a date where they are going to begin enforcement and so I would just like to work with you, the hope team at Hsd and the regional housing authority to begin those conversations as soon as possible.",68,,
298,0.97,1947.645,1962.994,"One I took a group of folks out there last Monday and one of the things we talked about, a lot of people--there's been a rush did a census of folks living there.",68,,
299,0.97,1971.636,1980.745,The concern about leaving their vehicle behind is one that came up though a great number of them at this location are not operating.,68,,
300,0.97,1980.745,1987.752,I'm wonder figure we could talk about perhaps providing an opportunity for some of the residents to visit camp second chance.,68,,
301,0.97,1987.752,1994.559,"You know, much like if you or I were to rent a place or buy a place we would visit it first.",68,,
302,0.97,1994.559,2012.643,"Just want to put that out ther as maybe something that he with could together facilitate to try to make what will be a very, very difficult transition for the folks residing in that location who resided there for almost five years, many of them to try to make that smoother.",68,,
303,0.97,2012.643,2015.78,We would very much like to work with you on that.,69,,
304,0.97,2015.78,2026.724,We know that many people living in Rv's actually--a large majority of them said they would be interested in tiny houses.,69,,
305,0.97,2026.724,2029.627,We are happy to show them the village.,69,,
306,0.97,2029.627,2033.698,Show them the facilities and tiny houses and work with the hope team.,69,,
307,0.97,2033.698,2038.269,Thank you.,70,,
308,0.97,2038.269,2042.407,Thank you.,71,,
309,0.97,2042.407,2044.509,So South village.,72,,
310,0.97,2044.509,2059.924,"Southend village just opened and we want to thank the Council and thank you--Councilmember Morales and Louis, you toured the facility and it is now open.",72,,
311,0.97,2059.924,2063.694,We have 21 people living there.,72,,
312,0.97,2063.694,2076.14,Our service providers include the refugee women's alliance and other organizations that are referring and were also working with the hope team.,72,,
313,0.97,2076.14,2081.679,"Reverand Willis, with true vine of Holiness Baptist church is the religious or faith sponsor.",72,,
314,0.97,2081.679,2086.117,This is right by the Ranier Beach station.,72,,
315,0.97,2086.117,2089.554,I don't know if people have questions about this.,72,,
316,0.97,2089.554,2105.77,"We also, many of the tiny houses are built by--sound foundations Northwest, built by volunteers including a lot of volunteers from Amazon web services.",72,,
317,0.97,2105.77,2106.938,Aws.,72,,
318,0.97,2106.938,2107.772,"So, thank you.",72,,
319,0.97,2107.772,2113.01,Ranier Beach coalition young people participated in that too at some point.,73,,
320,0.97,2113.01,2123.087,We had Ranier high school students and Ranier--they are part of the support and referral of people to the village.,74,,
321,0.97,2123.087,2129.327,"Can I s in regards to referrals to this village, one of the important things.",75,,
322,0.97,2129.327,2131.162,Councilmember Morales could speak to this too.,75,,
323,0.97,2131.162,2156.921,"When we are organizing to try to get the village going was that it could be a new resource for people experiencing homelessness in the Southend of Seattle to have a place to go and there was some coverage that early referrals were coming, mainly from North end camp locations and wonder if--it sounds like there's a lot of capacity, you said there's 21 folks there now.",75,,
324,0.97,2156.921,2158.256,There's a lot more space.,75,,
325,0.97,2158.256,2159.59,What's the focus going to be?,75,,
326,0.97,2159.59,2160.691,Do you know?,75,,
327,0.97,2160.691,2164.829,Our focus was the Southend.,76,,
328,0.97,2164.829,2170.735,The Ranieo Beach community and that is essentially what we are holding too.,76,,
329,0.97,2170.735,2174.872,"Initially when, you know we had it empty for a while because we didn't have the funding.",76,,
330,0.97,2174.872,2180.678,We want to thank you for your support.,76,,
331,0.97,2180.678,2190.888,"What happened was that what woodland Park, the city, the Mayor's office asked us to help on woodland park.",76,,
332,0.97,2190.888,2197.695,"So, they asked us for 30 spaces in tiny houses.",76,,
333,0.97,2197.695,2203.067,We said the priority is Southend in terms of Southend village.,76,,
334,0.97,2203.067,2208.94,"We did open up five tiny houses, five out of the 40.",76,,
335,0.97,2208.94,2214.845,Then we moved the other 25 people from woodland park too other tiny House Villanovas.,76,,
336,0.97,2214.845,2222.32,I think there will be a problem as we just don't have enough space for people.,76,,
337,0.97,2222.32,2229.06,Enhanced shelters are a good place for people to be until we can get them moved in to permanent housing.,76,,
338,0.97,2229.06,2237.635,We are hoping that there would be more support from the Council and the Mayor's office for more villages.,76,,
339,0.97,2237.635,2239.136,Can I follow up on that?,77,,
340,0.97,2239.136,2239.637,Of course.,78,,
341,0.97,2239.637,2243.608,I can't fell it this Mic works or not.,79,,
342,0.97,2243.608,2249.046,I'm used to looking for raised hand Emojis.,80,,
343,0.97,2249.046,2249.614,Yeah.,81,,
344,0.97,2249.614,2250.081,Regarding this issue.,81,,
345,0.97,2250.081,2257.688,You know as we were--we have been working--my office has within working with folks in the Mount Baker neighborhood for over two years now.,81,,
346,0.97,2257.688,2270.835,"You know we know there are folks in the green space, there are a lot of folks up on North Ranier where there is also at least a half dozen different development projects going in.",81,,
347,0.97,2270.835,2282.68,So I do think that the hope had been that at least some of those new units that are available in the Ranier Beach area would be available to them.,81,,
348,0.97,2282.68,2287.284,We have been working with reach and lead to try to get connection there from folks.,81,,
349,0.97,2287.284,2300.531,I wonder if you can talk a little about whether there is capacity to help with the outreach and maybe help some of those folks move into more stable situations.,81,,
350,0.97,2300.531,2301.432,Thank you Councilmember.,82,,
351,0.97,2301.432,2310.107,Some good news on that front is that we have also been coordinating reach and we have had a number of refer alleges from the camps.,82,,
352,0.97,2310.107,2313.811,Folks are starting to come in and be processed get a tiny house.,82,,
353,0.97,2313.811,2334.298,"A lot of the other referrals have been coming the community based partners like Ethopian community of Seattle, African, Muslim housing services, its been a mix but largely the vast majority of people are from the Ranier and Southend area.",82,,
354,0.97,2334.298,2334.932,Thank you.,83,,
355,0.97,2334.932,2337.601,"I think we can proceed, chair.",84,,
356,0.97,2337.601,2338.102,Okay.,85,,
357,0.97,2338.102,2338.302,Okay.,85,,
358,0.97,2338.302,2340.071,Go head.,86,,
359,0.97,2340.071,2341.605,Next slide.,87,,
360,0.97,2341.605,2343.607,Thank you Councilmembers.,88,,
361,0.97,2343.607,2356.854,"Today I will be going over the performance of our tiny House program and talking about kind of how things have been going, what are the Metrics we use to look at them and all that good stuff.",88,,
362,0.97,2356.854,2357.688,Just a real quick overview.,88,,
363,0.97,2357.688,2364.795,We have 11 tiny House villages throughout the Seattle.,88,,
364,0.97,2364.795,2373.537,You can see--it is equal on terms of--we now have a total of 466 tiny houses.,88,,
365,0.97,2373.537,2375.172,That includes the new village.,88,,
366,0.97,2375.172,2389.587,The 20 House expansion at camp second chance as well as the expansion at inner Bay up to 76 units there.,88,,
367,0.97,2389.587,2405.369,We--the Council in our 2021 budget did the inner Bay expansion up to 76 and then we have had done a similar expansion for camp second chance.,89,,
368,0.97,2405.369,2414.712,Is there any other village on this list that would be a good candidate to expand capacity or are we kind of topped out on the existing site?,89,,
369,0.97,2414.712,2419.416,If I were to pick one it would be Lake Union village.,90,,
370,0.97,2419.416,2425.089,With the real estate that is available you could fit five to 10 more houses there.,90,,
371,0.97,2425.089,2428.726,There may be other locations if we are going to do a deeper a significance.,90,,
372,0.97,2428.726,2433.697,Nothing on the scale of a 20 to 30 unit expansion.,91,,
373,0.97,2433.697,2438.969,There is a possibility of--that we can look at friendship heights.,92,,
374,0.97,2438.969,2441.539,Just wanted to flag that.,93,,
375,0.97,2441.539,2450.915,That seems to have been a Usel compromise in the last couple of years to try to expand capacity to existing sites rather than seek additional sites.,93,,
376,0.97,2450.915,2452.049,It's a pretty good idea.,93,,
377,0.97,2452.049,2456.554,The cost of expanding the village.,93,,
378,0.97,2456.554,2457.788,Putting the Capitol Kosta side.,93,,
379,0.97,2457.788,2460.057,The operating costs don't increase that much more.,93,,
380,0.97,2460.057,2464.028,It's the same 24-7 staff that are you paying for.,93,,
381,0.97,2464.028,2475.239,You may have to adjust another staff person for that rather than seven more staff people for a new village.,93,,
382,0.97,2475.239,2478.209,How much time do I have?,94,,
383,0.97,2478.209,2478.642,Gosh.,95,,
384,0.97,2478.642,2483.28,Its been such a long time since we have done this.,95,,
385,0.97,2483.28,2485.483,Take your time.,95,,
386,0.97,2485.483,2486.417,Don't feel rushed but efficient.,95,,
387,0.97,2486.417,2489.353,I will try to be seven to eight minute its.,96,,
388,0.97,2489.353,2492.423,I will just read one of these success stories.,96,,
389,0.97,2492.423,2494.158,This comes camp second chance.,96,,
390,0.97,2494.158,2497.628,We changed the name to respect privacy.,96,,
391,0.97,2497.628,2505.369,Craig is a 58-Year-Old United States Navy veteran who worked closely with Lihi case manager mark are you Johnson.,96,,
392,0.97,2505.369,2513.41,She went straight to work to set him one supportive services for veterans and family was he was screened and approved.,96,,
393,0.97,2513.41,2516.146,Right after getting at proved he got the job of a lifetime.,96,,
394,0.97,2516.146,2529.126,He started to work with the Polly clinic in January of 20 and he was living in an apartment building for seniors.,96,,
395,0.97,2529.126,2541.739,He said I have a home and a job and you helped me with both when he asked how his first night sleeping in his room went he Sate wonderful and expressed gratitude for all of Li Hi's help.,96,,
396,0.97,2541.739,2552.95,There are so many stories and this is one person's journey this say program that really does transform and change people's lives.,96,,
397,0.97,2552.95,2553.884,Next slide please.,96,,
398,0.97,2557.955,2564.695,He with wanted to focus on the importance of tiny houses.,96,,
399,0.97,2564.695,2566.497,It was--extraordinarily successful.,96,,
400,0.97,2566.497,2574.939,We only had 14 cases of Covid throughout all of our tiny houses for the 745 people served in 2021.,96,,
401,0.97,2574.939,2584.782,"To put that into perspective, system wide across all emergency shelters, King County public health reported about 748 confirmed cases and eight deaths.",96,,
402,0.97,2584.782,2589.653,We had 0 deaths from Covid in the shelter program.,96,,
403,0.97,2600.631,2605.603,This is a summary of how we did last year.,96,,
404,0.97,2605.603,2613.944,When the program started we served 260 people who received shelter.,96,,
405,0.97,2613.944,2619.483,We in 2021 served 741 unique people.,96,,
406,0.97,2619.483,2621.652,56% found stable homes.,96,,
407,0.97,2621.652,2628.359,That meant 60% found permanent housing.,96,,
408,0.97,2628.359,2629.56,That.,96,,
409,0.97,2629.56,2630.894,57 people we served are homeless.,96,,
410,0.97,2630.894,2633.097,I think that is worth focusing on.,96,,
411,0.97,2633.097,2642.339,The folks that have the hardest barriers have the most success to be a place in permanent housing.,96,,
412,0.97,2642.339,2650.08,The majority of folks were black and people of color.,96,,
413,0.97,2650.08,2650.981,65% moved out.,96,,
414,0.97,2650.981,2656.086,There we will go over in greater detail with that length of stay figure.,96,,
415,0.97,2656.086,2665.829,This is a screen grab of the King County--systems dashboard for shelters.,96,,
416,0.97,2665.829,2666.263,For emergency shelter.,96,,
417,0.97,2678.142,2684.648,How many return to homeless and what is the use rate.,96,,
418,0.97,2684.648,2690.22,Use automatic means how many were empty or are occupied I guess.,96,,
419,0.97,2690.22,2694.358,If 76% use rent rates meant that 76% of the time there was someone in a unit.,96,,
420,0.97,2694.358,2698.062,Can I ask some questions here?,97,,
421,0.97,2698.062,2698.328,Sure.,98,,
422,0.97,2698.328,2706.437,I see that there is a--I'm just trying to reconcile the slide with the previous slide.,99,,
423,0.97,2706.437,2713.21,There's a 9% and maybe it's because the case Hra in this data set isn't measuring everything.,99,,
424,0.97,2713.21,2719.583,There's a 9% return to homelessness and a 16% to permanent housing.,99,,
425,0.97,2728.425,2731.762,This is for--the system as a whole this is the system.,99,,
426,0.97,2731.762,2732.196,I apologize.,100,,
427,0.97,2732.196,2734.965,I will walk you through it.,100,,
428,0.97,2734.965,2736.1,Okay.,101,,
429,0.97,2736.1,2738.669,The next slide will clarify a lot of this.,102,,
430,0.97,2738.669,2742.039,I thought it was specifically for the tiny houses.,103,,
431,0.97,2742.039,2742.306,I'm Orry.,103,,
432,0.97,2742.306,2743.006,No.,104,,
433,0.97,2743.006,2743.54,Let's take a look.,104,,
434,0.97,2743.54,2745.609,What I want to --,104,,
435,0.97,2745.609,2746.243,Here we go.,105,,
436,0.97,2746.243,2757.654,"What I wanted to do was to look at the standards that Rha uses to look at program performance where shelter across its system, compared to tiny House villages.",106,,
437,0.97,2757.654,2764.027,This is all--I want to say this is all data from Hnis.,106,,
438,0.97,2764.027,2765.562,This is not internal data.,106,,
439,0.97,2765.562,2766.196,With that first category.,106,,
440,0.97,2766.196,2768.999,Folk who exit to permanent housing.,106,,
441,0.97,2768.999,2773.403,The dashboard is around 16%.,106,,
442,0.97,2773.403,2774.671,Tiny houses is 47.44%.,106,,
443,0.97,2774.671,2779.543,Did we meet the minimum standard of 14% in the answer was yes.,106,,
444,0.97,2779.543,2784.348,The next is length of stay using the average count of days.,106,,
445,0.97,2784.348,2788.986,This--we did not meet the minimum standards but neither did any other shelter.,106,,
446,0.97,2788.986,2793.991,With he will do a deeper dive on average length of stay in the next slide.,106,,
447,0.97,2793.991,2794.591,Return to homelessness.,106,,
448,0.97,2794.591,2801.498,How many returned after they had been housed?,106,,
449,0.97,2801.498,2802.199,This is 9%.,106,,
450,0.97,2802.199,2807.004,It's below the minimum of 10% across the system.,106,,
451,0.97,2807.004,2810.841,Tiny houses out Preform only at 3.85%.,106,,
452,0.97,2810.841,2814.845,That means very few are returning.,106,,
453,0.97,2814.845,2819.249,"The use rate, how many are actually using the shelters.",106,,
454,0.97,2819.249,2827.357,We have a--like a shockingly high use rate across the system it's 76%?,106,,
455,0.97,2827.357,2834.398,The tiny houses are 92% and rarely--around 90.,106,,
456,0.97,2834.398,2836.733,This is really important to say.,106,,
457,0.97,2836.733,2837.334,People want tiny houses.,106,,
458,0.97,2837.334,2844.007,"There are a lot of folk that don't feel safe in a shelter, a mat on the floor.",106,,
459,0.97,2844.007,2845.943,They want a locking door.,106,,
460,0.97,2845.943,2856.353,They want our own space and to feel safe this is why we have a high use rate for the tiny House village program.,106,,
461,0.97,2856.353,2856.954,Next slide please.,106,,
462,0.97,2856.954,2863.126,"We wanted to also focus on, you know, one of the measures that we did not meet was the average length of stay.",106,,
463,0.97,2863.126,2866.73,We wanted to talk about what that means.,106,,
464,0.97,2866.73,2876.673,"During the pandemic, you know one of the key--reasons that the village is successful is that it connects people to case management.",106,,
465,0.97,2876.673,2881.612,"During the pandemic, we had--we struggled to connect people to case management.",106,,
466,0.97,2881.612,2888.518,If folks refused to engage there is no resource to address that issue.,106,,
467,0.97,2888.518,2891.655,Folks starting paying in the program much longer.,106,,
468,0.97,2891.655,2900.163,During what we call those folks but folk who have been in the program for go years or more a long term Stayer.,106,,
469,0.97,2900.163,2906.536,They had a impact when measuring the program using an average.,106,,
470,0.97,2906.536,2906.737,Okay?,106,,
471,0.97,2906.737,2909.606,This impact is compounded when only the yearly date range is used.,106,,
472,0.97,2909.606,2911.708,What does that mean?,106,,
473,0.97,2911.708,2913.81,I will explain in a comment.,106,,
474,0.97,2913.81,2914.011,For.,106,,
475,0.97,2914.011,2916.813,Jon I think we have a question.,107,,
476,0.97,2916.813,2919.216,Just some Definitional things before we move on.,108,,
477,0.97,2919.216,2921.518,What is a long term Stayer?,108,,
478,0.97,2921.518,2923.22,What is--how are you defining that?,108,,
479,0.97,2923.22,2932.596,"That is our internal Li in, go for someone who has been in a tiny House program and has stayed there for over two years.",109,,
480,0.97,2932.596,2958.956,"Two years and then what you just described and one of the bullets under length of stay, suggests that your ability to--your lack of ability to exit people who have not engaged with case management has increased your length of stay numbers.",110,,
481,0.97,2958.956,2960.958,I wouldn't say that's the only reason.,110,,
482,0.97,2960.958,2966.396,There will be other factor that result in someone staying long longer the program.,110,,
483,0.97,2966.396,2968.532,The most obvious one a lack Avenue Fordable housing.,110,,
484,0.97,2968.532,2971.635,That kind of jumped out at me.,111,,
485,0.97,2971.635,2982.312,I just don't want to rely too much on our ability to exit people who are engaging in services as a way to improve our length of stay.,111,,
486,0.97,2982.312,2997.294,No and there is a whole section we will talk about what is our strategies moving forward to make sure we address folks in the program for a long term that is a compassion approach.,112,,
487,0.97,2997.294,3013.21,"And also I did have in the same line of thinking, there is a sentence that says, Typy House residents required to accept placement to permanent housing with in six months.",113,,
488,0.97,3013.21,3017.848,Can you just talk a little about how you are able to require this?,113,,
489,0.97,3017.848,3018.682,I don't see that.,114,,
490,0.97,3018.682,3025.789,That was on the slide 15 under outcomes.,115,,
491,0.97,3025.789,3029.626,Is it a slide we passed?,116,,
492,0.97,3029.626,3032.195,I think 15.,117,,
493,0.97,3032.195,3033.597,The outcome slide.,117,,
494,0.97,3033.597,3034.798,May becoming up.,118,,
495,0.97,3034.798,3035.298,2021.,119,,
496,0.97,3035.298,3038.402,Which haven't gotten there yet.,120,,
497,0.97,3038.402,3038.769,I'm sorry.,121,,
498,0.97,3038.769,3039.102,I thought.,121,,
499,0.97,3039.102,3041.571,Why don't we go to the next slide.,122,,
500,0.97,3041.571,3046.143,My bad.,123,,
501,0.97,3046.143,3054.785,"This is--this is really important and I also want to say you know, we are not looking for special treatment as an organization.",124,,
502,0.97,3054.785,3064.895,We understand the need that there needs to be a standard measurement that we use to determine how programs are working.,124,,
503,0.97,3064.895,3076.306,So please take this information as additive this is meant to inform up as policy makers to give you more nuance and understanding of how our program work that's a little bit different than other models.,124,,
504,0.97,3076.306,3094.057,"What we are looking at here is taking the way that the standard length of stay average is used over the length or the lifetime of the program, verses counting long term Stayers in a single year.",124,,
505,0.97,3094.057,3094.558,What does that mean?,124,,
506,0.97,3094.558,3096.593,In 2015 is when the program started.,124,,
507,0.97,3096.593,3100.764,Obviously we aren't going to have anyone who is long term Stayer.,124,,
508,0.97,3100.764,3102.199,"As time goes on, right.",124,,
509,0.97,3102.199,3107.037,You will so more people who enter the program and are staying a longer period of time.,124,,
510,0.97,3107.037,3126.123,"If you count in a single year, how many folks are in the program, it is going to distort the number of people that it appears to--that appear to be in the program for a longer period of time.",124,,
511,0.97,3126.123,3139.603,"So, the Orange line is using an annual count and average and the exact same data if you start from 2015 over the lifetime of the program you can see that the average length of stay actually drops.",124,,
512,0.97,3139.603,3149.646,"That means you will go from 2015 to 2016, 2015 to 2017 so forth and so forth this will make more sense in the next slide.",124,,
513,0.97,3149.646,3153.45,Go to the next slide.,124,,
514,0.97,3153.45,3163.193,"So, using a Medin number over the lifetime of the program you are getting a full picture of how successful the program is working rather than just looking at a snap shot in a single year.",124,,
515,0.97,3163.193,3166.129,People are not in the program just for one year.,124,,
516,0.97,3166.129,3175.572,They may be in for multiple years when you look at that information you see that 65% move out with in the six months.,124,,
517,0.97,3175.572,3180.644,That there is a median--excuse me 114Medin stay.,124,,
518,0.97,3180.644,3183.013,Not average but a Medin.,124,,
519,0.97,3183.013,3192.989,If you use that means that less than--only 6% of the population are in the program for more than two years.,124,,
520,0.97,3192.989,3193.59,We are talking about 6%.,124,,
521,0.97,3193.59,3206.87,I think that the reason that we look at these figures this way is that if you look at the average length of stay a couple slides back you will see that it's over 300 days as the average length of stay for someone.,124,,
522,0.97,3206.87,3215.779,I think that is very--kind of Mislaiding in terms of how successful this program is at moving people through and getting them into housing.,124,,
523,0.97,3215.779,3217.747,Council press JA Urez has a question.,125,,
524,0.97,3217.747,3219.316,Hey.,126,,
525,0.97,3219.316,3219.983,Good to see you guys.,126,,
526,0.97,3219.983,3224.654,This may just be more of a practical and thank you for the power point.,127,,
527,0.97,3224.654,3236.333,I printed out as well with the numbers and now we have the understand with the King County regional housing authority and what Lihi is with the success.,127,,
528,0.97,3236.333,3242.539,You can tell me more about the 6% who are the people more than two year that don't want to leave?,127,,
529,0.97,3242.539,3244.174,What are we doing about that?,127,,
530,0.97,3244.174,3246.109,Next slide.,128,,
531,0.97,3246.109,3246.476,Good.,129,,
532,0.97,3246.476,3248.678,Well.,129,,
533,0.97,3248.678,3249.145,Just on fire.,129,,
534,0.97,3249.145,3252.115,Go into next slide after this one.,130,,
535,0.97,3252.115,3263.426,"2021 and 2022 we deployed what we called our long term Stayer housing strategy and to answer your question, you can see in the chart its been successful.",131,,
536,0.97,3263.426,3271.067,From 2018 to 2021 you are seeing more and more people who are long term Stayers getting moved out and housed.,131,,
537,0.97,3271.067,3272.702,How did we do this?,131,,
538,0.97,3272.702,3275.438,We do it a couple ways.,131,,
539,0.97,3275.438,3280.41,One of them is the most obvious example that we have more housing in to the system.,131,,
540,0.97,3280.41,3290.353,We used our rapid acquisition strategy that we discussed where we bought six properties and over--almost overnight convert them to permanent supportive housing.,131,,
541,0.97,3290.353,3308.538,We have priorities for people who were in tiny houses who were long term Stayers and as of today 41 or 33% of the folks who had within long term Stayers got housed in a very short period of time doing that.,131,,
542,0.97,3308.538,3317.514,"In addition last year the Council made a $600,000--investment to--expand behavioral health services.",131,,
543,0.97,3317.514,3321.785,Not all the victim ages had behavioral health services.,131,,
544,0.97,3321.785,3336.066,"We have partnered with their pay health services to provide substance abuse counsel, mental health and to expand that to our other villages that is currently in process.",131,,
545,0.97,3336.066,3338.868,And let's see here.,131,,
546,0.97,3338.868,3347.811,"Getting to your question, Councilmember Herbold about how are people staying in the program for--and how are goals set.",131,,
547,0.97,3347.811,3349.479,We have a six month stay goal.,131,,
548,0.97,3349.479,3351.481,I want to be clear about this.,131,,
549,0.97,3351.481,3355.752,"If you are in the program, for six months you are out.",131,,
550,0.97,3355.752,3359.289,That's not how it works this is just setting a goal.,131,,
551,0.97,3359.289,3367.163,We want folks to try to set a housing plan for themselves that can get them out of the village and into housing in six months.,131,,
552,0.97,3367.163,3371.868,If we can't find housing we won't ask you to leave.,131,,
553,0.97,3371.868,3372.802,It's about really managing expectations.,131,,
554,0.97,3372.802,3394.924,"If you tell someone who is coming off the street that the tiny house is your forever home one, I hope that's not the case and, we want to make sure that folks are--that we are setting expectations of folk that we want them to work with case managers, address whatever barriers they are facing and get them into permanent housing.",131,,
555,0.97,3394.924,3412.842,"If you look at the% bullet, we had 121 long term Stayers and we now have 41 which is a significant decrease so 41 long term Stayers and 700 some people a year.",132,,
556,0.97,3412.842,3417.68,As you know many of the existing shelters also have long term Stayers.,132,,
557,0.97,3417.68,3425.422,We don't want to be the only one like we have excess I numbers of long term Stayers we don't.,132,,
558,0.97,3425.422,3426.823,We only have 41 right now.,132,,
559,0.97,3426.823,3429.392,I think the program is working really well.,132,,
560,0.97,3429.392,3435.899,If you look at the last bullet we move people into rapid acquisition buildings.,132,,
561,0.97,3435.899,3448.511,You know many of them are the ones that you fund is through jump start and that has made a huge start in terms of through put moving people out of tiny houses and into permanent housing.,132,,
562,0.97,3448.511,3454.818,And you asked the question who are these folks that are staying a long time.,133,,
563,0.97,3454.818,3455.985,The answer is varied.,133,,
564,0.97,3455.985,3459.422,I would say you can probably put them into two groups.,133,,
565,0.97,3459.422,3466.93,One group is folks who are high Acuity with severe substance abuse issues or mental health issues.,133,,
566,0.97,3466.93,3476.339,That's why it's so important that's Council make that investment to expand behavioral health services on site at the villages.,133,,
567,0.97,3476.339,3486.249,Those folks at some point may get approved for a permanent supportive housing unit which there are very few of but there are more Online as time goes on.,133,,
568,0.97,3486.249,3486.983,Follow-up question.,134,,
569,0.97,3486.983,3487.45,I'm sorry.,135,,
570,0.97,3487.45,3490.954,I have a follow-up question when are you done.,136,,
571,0.97,3490.954,3510.807,"The second group of people are folk that don't qualify for permanent supportive housing but perhaps are working or maybe have a--a disability but not Sosa veer that they could get qualified for permanent supportive housing which is a deeper service level, right?",137,,
572,0.97,3510.807,3511.507,It's the working poor.,137,,
573,0.97,3511.507,3520.683,It's folks that may have a day job but they can't afford housing in Seattle.,137,,
574,0.97,3520.683,3524.087,They don't qualify for those deeper units through permanent supportive housing.,137,,
575,0.97,3524.087,3527.056,They kind of in this in between zone.,137,,
576,0.97,3527.056,3529.525,The answer there is we need more affordable housing.,137,,
577,0.97,3529.525,3533.162,My question wasn't to pint out that tiny houses don't work.,138,,
578,0.97,3533.162,3535.532,I'm not--that's not the point of my question.,138,,
579,0.97,3535.532,3567.53,"My question is what we target in on the individuals, maybe--at least I have--what I have been seeing fought the last six years is are there's colon I can homeless and are they getting the services and--I'm not asking the question to point out that you are not moving enough people out out of tiny House villages but the limited population and if that's a small amount of what you have I would imagine we have with people living Unhoused on the street.",138,,
580,0.97,3567.53,3569.966,That is why I was getting it done.,138,,
581,0.97,3569.966,3573.937,Who are those people who how do we get to them?,138,,
582,0.97,3573.937,3574.804,Thank you.,139,,
583,0.97,3574.804,3581.678,I want to make a sort of short addition to that.,140,,
584,0.97,3581.678,3589.218,"Is that--as Councilmember Herbold, remembers on camp second chance.",140,,
585,0.97,3589.218,3609.806,"The people who initially occupied camp second chance and some of the other villages they were not necessarily, they were self managed and at that point in the very beginning, people felt that once they were in the village they could stay forever and so it was not seen as a enhanced shelter program.",140,,
586,0.97,3609.806,3614.243,"It was seen as, you know, we are homeless, we are protesting.",140,,
587,0.97,3614.243,3621.25,We are going to take the land.,140,,
588,0.97,3621.25,3621.684,We will occupy it.,140,,
589,0.97,3621.684,3645.575,"There was a sense people would like to stay and transition on their own time frame which we think, you know s a low by barrier approach and what we try to do is create incentives and the case management have lots of housing resources.",140,,
590,0.97,3645.575,3646.476,I'm almost done.,141,,
591,0.97,3646.476,3653.383,Should we go to the previous slide?,142,,
592,0.97,3653.383,3656.619,Thank you.,143,,
593,0.97,3656.619,3661.524,Just back one please.,144,,
594,0.97,3661.524,3663.793,Can you go in the reverse direction twice now?,144,,
595,0.97,3663.793,3672.368,It or Whoever is doing the slides we took one out of order.,145,,
596,0.97,3672.368,3672.869,There we go.,145,,
597,0.97,3672.869,3681.411,You may have heard recently numbers put out about the cost of the program and we wanted to clarify some things.,145,,
598,0.97,3681.411,3691.487,"So, tiny House villages are very affordable to sleep in terms of the Capitol costs and affordable to operate.",145,,
599,0.97,3691.487,3704.701,The regional homelessness authority published during their budget presentations what they came one a new term called cost per exist which is not a metric that we have been looked at before.,145,,
600,0.97,3704.701,3713.976,"The figure that they determined was $64,000, 64 horse per person using that M, Tric.",145,,
601,0.97,3713.976,3716.746,We don't know how they got that number.,145,,
602,0.97,3716.746,3720.383,With Rewelcome to discuss with them about that.,145,,
603,0.97,3720.383,3735.598,"When we take the 6.3 million that we use to operate our villages last year and apply it to the 745 unique people that we served it comes out closer to about $9,000 per person.",145,,
604,0.97,3735.598,3735.865,You know.,145,,
605,0.97,3735.865,3741.37,Reasonable minds can disagree and certainly we are welcome to any kind of dialogue or discussion.,145,,
606,0.97,3741.37,3749.579,The bottom line is this is a very cost effective program for folks who are out on the streets.,145,,
607,0.97,3749.579,3757.653,If you were to try to build a transitional housing or permanent housing building.,145,,
608,0.97,3757.653,3760.323,"That would be closer to $350,000 per unit.",145,,
609,0.97,3760.323,3770.967,"Just for the construction costs but the development costs for example at Southend village was closer to $20,000 per unit.",145,,
610,0.97,3770.967,3777.74,It's just--very clear to us looking at the numbers that it's a very cost effective program.,145,,
611,0.97,3777.74,3780.376,"Also, it's relatively quick to deploy.",145,,
612,0.97,3780.376,3791.521,It takes us about eight to ten weeks after we identified a site to build a tiny House village whereas a permanent housing property if you are lucky takes between 3 to 4 years.,145,,
613,0.97,3791.521,3799.095,Our position is that we are in a homelessness crisis.,145,,
614,0.97,3799.095,3801.23,We will go two more slides forward.,146,,
615,0.97,3801.23,3805.701,I think we have a--a question from Councilmember Herbold.,147,,
616,0.97,3805.701,3807.203,Thank you.,148,,
617,0.97,3807.203,3815.711,"As I understand, the metric that you are proposing, should be used.",149,,
618,0.97,3815.711,3818.981,It's a cost per person per year.,149,,
619,0.97,3818.981,3825.755,It doesn't factor in the length of stay.,149,,
620,0.97,3825.755,3826.956,What the Rha number factors in.,149,,
621,0.97,3826.956,3829.559,We are comparing apples to oranges for sure.,150,,
622,0.97,3829.559,3832.428,I want to be clear about that.,150,,
623,0.97,3832.428,3835.865,We are using a different metric than them.,150,,
624,0.97,3835.865,3840.536,"So, is that a metric that Rha is using across the system or one that.",151,,
625,0.97,3840.536,3846.709,The first time we heard of it was during the last budget presentation.,152,,
626,0.97,3846.709,3850.813,Do you know if they are using that same metric from other.,153,,
627,0.97,3850.813,3853.583,They are.,154,,
628,0.97,3853.583,3859.288,They used that metric for transitional housing as well and perhaps others.,154,,
629,0.97,3859.288,3860.623,Thank you.,155,,
630,0.97,3860.623,3863.292,"Can we go, yes, thank you.",156,,
631,0.97,3863.292,3863.726,Just rounding out.,156,,
632,0.97,3863.726,3870.967,We wanted to give you our year to date numbers because what we were looking at were numbers 2021.,156,,
633,0.97,3870.967,3875.738,So year to date we have been serving 659 people.,156,,
634,0.97,3875.738,3878.674,Our exit to permanent housing was skyrocketed.,156,,
635,0.97,3878.674,3879.775,It's as high as 60%.,156,,
636,0.97,3879.775,3885.014,If you may recall it was around 50% previously.,156,,
637,0.97,3885.014,3889.585,The use rate is around 90%.,156,,
638,0.97,3889.585,3894.757,The return to homelessness has increased Unfortunately 8%.,156,,
639,0.97,3894.757,3896.692,That's a Relativive figure.,156,,
640,0.97,3896.692,3898.261,The average median length of stay is 114 days.,156,,
641,0.97,3898.261,3910.473,The long and short is that the tiny House village is cost effective and very successful at getting people housed and keeping people sheltered.,156,,
642,0.97,3910.473,3917.98,Thank you for this presentation and as you know I--there's another slide for future projects.,157,,
643,0.97,3917.98,3921.083,There's one more slide that's.,157,,
644,0.97,3921.083,3925.588,If we--to ask about this two.,158,,
645,0.97,3925.588,3938.534,You know I don't object to the way they work out the costs in some respect I think that it's explained by the context of low return to homelessness.,158,,
646,0.97,3938.534,3945.041,I mean under the Metrics that--you will have a cheaper cost per person if more people are dropping out.,158,,
647,0.97,3945.041,3954.917,The combination of the low return to homelessness and the high use is going to produce a higher number.,158,,
648,0.97,3954.917,3960.423,The return to homelessness is and the exit are the Stats.,158,,
649,0.97,3963.092,3971.701,Úthat I think we are continuing to--and we appreciate that we have that very clearly in front of us in the presentation.,158,,
650,0.97,3971.701,3980.242,I appreciate this and looking forward to continuing to work with Lihi on the projects.,158,,
651,0.97,3980.242,3984.947,Did colleagues have more questions before we moved to that last slide?,158,,
652,0.97,3984.947,3985.214,No.,158,,
653,0.97,3985.214,3986.315,Let's go to the next slide.,158,,
654,0.97,3986.315,3990.619,Ly turn it over to Sharon.,159,,
655,0.97,3990.619,4012.174,We are concerned about the--the number of Rv's on the streets and so we did apply to Rha to stand up a Rv a lot and we will be informed pretty soon whether if he were selected to do that.,160,,
656,0.97,4012.174,4038.834,"There is a question of how many months that contract will be if we get that contract and of course it's hard to--unless we have a city owned piece of property or county owned piece of property, it's hard to go rent a place like a private lot and not be able to do like rent it for a year or, you know multiyear or something like that.",160,,
657,0.97,4038.834,4048.377,If the Council or the executives have ideas for public owned property that would be ideal.,160,,
658,0.97,4048.377,4053.682,Otherwise we will have to just junta round with--private Ownerns.,160,,
659,0.97,4053.682,4060.823,Then we would be interested in doing new tiny House villages and we have sound foundations Northwest.,160,,
660,0.97,4060.823,4063.459,We have lots of volunteers.,160,,
661,0.97,4063.459,4068.564,"We have school students, technical colleges, businesses, church groups, building tiny houses for us.",160,,
662,0.97,4068.564,4088.083,"The cost of a tiny house in terms of material is still 4,200 and then we have volunteers and the additional cost you have seen is like bringing in the water, sewer, electricity and setting up the common kitchen and Hygeine services.",160,,
663,0.97,4088.083,4097.993,We would be interested in put working in partnership with the city to do more tiny House villages and then the rapid acquisition again you have seen the success of that.,160,,
664,0.97,4097.993,4100.362,This year is another opportunity.,160,,
665,0.97,4100.362,4116.145,"I think that you your budget actions in the Supple mental actions, for income tax year will have a big impact on what extent we would to get more people housed safe and warm.",160,,
666,0.97,4116.145,4120.649,I think that--Seattle is a national leader in terms of innovation.,160,,
667,0.97,4120.649,4128.591,"We want to thank you and hope you will come and visit some of our new buildings, come and visit dock side and come and visit some tiny House villages.",160,,
668,0.97,4128.591,4129.258,Thank you.,161,,

825,0.97,5191.886,5200.128,Nearly twice as many people are now checking out Digital materials on a monthly basis than physical materials.,185,,

861,0.97,5406.601,5413.708,We also asked the same question about how people felt about the library.,185,,

865,0.97,5432.56,5451.646,"While there was strong support for Thicks like Monday closures, weekend hours willingness to trade open hours, for 24 access to physical material such as the pick um lockers there were important differences by branch which largely reflected how different communities use their libraries.",185,,
866,0.97,5451.646,5459.72,"For example in the southeast part of the city, people were far less likely to support fewer hours, for 24 hours access.",185,,
867,0.97,5459.72,5477.138,"In other words they wanted their libraries, patrons--in the southeast tend to set priorities for Internet access and welcoming spaces relatively more than patron who frequent branches in other parts of the city.",185,,

871,0.97,5492.787,5501.562,Now it has come back to where it's 50% or more of our circulation from month to month.,185,,
872,0.97,5501.562,5501.896,Next please.,185,,
873,0.97,5501.896,5513.808,"And--as indicated by this meeting today, the library looks off for more hybrid services, virtual and in person.",185,,

877,0.97,5534.562,5559.787,We have yet to be able to offer this as our--children at those ages have not been approved for vaccines and we are still trying to safely determine ways to deliver the programs in the future with our libraries and our partners in the community.,185,,
878,0.97,5559.787,5560.521,Next please.,185,,
879,0.97,5563.424,5573.634,During the busy year the maintenance team at the library worked to get central library in the 26 branches open.,185,,
880,0.97,5573.634,5581.008,The janitor and custody team spent hours deep cleaning the library and the branches.,185,,
881,0.97,5581.008,5590.084,A scrubbing to end in many cases and doing many emergency deep cleans when necessary if there were Covid cases.,185,,
882,0.97,5590.084,5599.393,"As you can see here on this slide, this shows some of the work we are doing at our green Lake branch.",185,,
883,0.97,5599.393,5607.768,It's having an earthquake retrofit and we are excited that this is--being--going out to bid and we hope to start construction on this later this fall.,185,,

888,0.97,5632.893,5643.104,"However, 2021 once again being a challenging year had supply chain issues, labor shortages and a number of other pandemic related construction delays.",185,,
889,0.97,5643.104,5648.242,Only about 2.1 million of those funds were spent.,185,,
890,0.97,5648.242,5657.084,"However, with--with the progress on green Lake, those funds will be starting to be spent down as we get--how through 2022 and 2023.",185,,
891,0.97,5657.084,5663.624,As we move through other projects are able to advance.,185,,
892,0.97,5663.624,5663.958,Next please.,185,,
893,0.97,5663.958,5672.199,"This slide you will note that most of the libraries levy was in maintenance and technology, Capitol improvement.",185,,
894,0.97,5672.199,5689.517,In both those areas there were large--large multiyear projects with budget authority being front loads to allow the library to enter contracts when needed as it moves through construction planning or as it moves through technology road maps.,185,,
895,0.97,5689.517,5702.096,"As described earlier the labor shortages, supply chain issues and other Replated Connecticut struck delays may result in some under spending as we move forward and has most certainly in the past.",185,,
896,0.97,5702.096,5707.601,The savings on the operation side does go in to the levy fund balance.,185,,
897,0.97,5707.601,5710.171,Levy fund balance is used to address inflation.,185,,
898,0.97,5710.171,5720.815,"It exceeds 4% which was the levy planning on the course everybody here knows, we are experiencing higher than 4% inflation at this time.",185,,
899,0.97,5720.815,5732.827,"The levy fund balance covers unexpected costs, and other areas, for example the need for increased security at branches, during the pandemic and sense.",185,,
900,0.97,5732.827,5739.033,"Also, any unexpected damage or equipment fall you're that may happen.",185,,

903,0.97,5746.307,5766.26,"We are very fortunate to have patrons who reach out to us as you know for some things that they may may not be working well but they are also encouraging and excited in their support for us and very--very, many, many kind messages that we do share with our staff when we receive them.",185,,
904,0.97,5766.26,5769.363,I will take any questions you may have.,185,,
905,0.97,5769.363,5769.73,Tom.,186,,
906,0.97,5769.73,5775.836,Thank you so much for that presentation.,186,,
907,0.97,5775.836,5779.106,"Council, colleagues, does anyone have a question?",186,,

909,0.97,5779.874,5790.818,"I don't, have a question but I just want to thank Tom for stepping in these last couple years.",187,,
910,0.97,5790.818,5792.62,For Upping the hot spots which was fantastic.,187,,
911,0.97,5792.62,5800.661,I know we had the Federal money that made a really big difference.,187,,
912,0.97,5800.661,5801.162,Eliminating the fines.,187,,
913,0.97,5801.162,5804.598,Updating the Wifi and the technology aspect of libraries.,187,,
914,0.97,5804.598,5810.437,I'm really glad that you pointed out that library use is different in the Southend than in the North end.,187,,
915,0.97,5810.437,5814.875,We have seen that in--I think in my district we have three libraries.,187,,
916,0.97,5814.875,5819.814,Also for the social worker that we have in the downtown branch.,187,,
917,0.97,5819.814,5825.252,You like parks really save the day in the last two years during the pandemic.,187,,
918,0.97,5825.252,5825.686,You came through.,187,,
919,0.97,5825.686,5832.893,You your staff did thing that normally they wouldn't do when they went to work for a library and we did it.,187,,
920,0.97,5832.893,5838.365,We worked well to get it done and I want to thank you for that.,187,,
921,0.97,5838.365,5838.866,Through Mr. chair.,187,,
922,0.97,5838.866,5841.635,Thank you.,188,,
923,0.97,5841.635,5845.372,Any other questions from Councilmembers in Morales?,188,,
924,0.97,5845.372,5846.24,Thank you.,189,,
925,0.97,5846.24,5852.646,I'm not sure where to work right now.,189,,
926,0.97,5852.646,5853.013,Thank you Tom.,189,,
927,0.97,5853.013,5859.553,I do want to say thank you for the--I'm not sure where I'm looking.,189,,
928,0.97,5859.553,5865.025,For the hot spots we are really important particularly in the Southend.,189,,
929,0.97,5865.025,5868.195,You know we have really terrible enter in the connection in the Southend.,189,,
930,0.97,5868.195,5878.038,"I'm not sure why and so it was important especially for students who eventually were able to get back into school, to have access to that.",189,,
931,0.97,5878.038,5887.815,I think we all heard a lot of stories about students sitting in grocery store parking lots to do their homework.,189,,
932,0.97,5887.815,5889.617,Those hot spots were important.,189,,
933,0.97,5889.617,5898.392,I do want to ask you--you know we--we all know that libraries do so much more for our communities than just provide books.,189,,
934,0.97,5898.392,5913.44,"People use them for school, for applying for jobs, for community gathering, even as--Council President JA Urez said as gathering spaces during weather.",189,,
935,0.97,5913.44,5942.97,"I wonder if you can talk about what lessons you may have Leashed about God forbid another worse variant comes through or another disaster but what is the library doing to prepare so that the next time we have some big shock like this, it is easier to continue service, to continue to provide access to all the resources that the library offers to the community.",189,,
936,0.97,5942.97,5953.647,I think that--the one thing we learned I think--that everybody learned was that we weren't prepared for that work from home in a massive way.,190,,
937,0.97,5953.647,5960.321,"Also supporting remote, not only remote workers but remote patrons and users.",190,,
938,0.97,5960.321,5969.63,One thing we continued to build upon is hopefully build that capacity of having the ability to return to that moment if we have to.,190,,
939,0.97,5969.63,5990.884,"As we developed the reopening plan at that point that was my job before I took on this role was getting everything reopened and one of the ways we structured it was working obviously with our staff, our managers, and our Union or labor partners and creating reopening process that was modular.",190,,
940,0.97,5990.884,5996.99,We took steps in kind of a modular block forward so if we had to move back we could move back.,190,,
941,0.97,5996.99,6006.266,We were really thoughtful in the way we approached reopening so if we had to move back in any Pha seconds we could do that.,190,,
942,0.97,6006.266,6009.002,Realizing that we would have to move technology back.,190,,
943,0.97,6009.002,6023.717,"All of those things, but we already now what was going to be happening and we also knew that we could do it in bite sized chunks that question could sustain and support if we had to move back in that process of moving forward.",190,,
944,0.97,6023.717,6053.08,"We have learned a lot and think the one thing that we are still both learning and developing is going to be how we develop the hybrid model further so we can support patrons in the way that's most comfortable, most efficient or effective for them but yet also still those in person Acceptions for--those thing that are really important to have that one on one time that sometimes can't be experienced in these formats.",190,,
945,0.97,6053.08,6058.285,Tom I will jump in for a question real quick.,191,,
946,0.97,6058.285,6061.622,Really appreciate this summary of the survey and particular.,191,,
947,0.97,6061.622,6065.626,I guess I will look at the cameras.,191,,
948,0.97,6065.626,6069.63,As the place to Orient myself here.,191,,
949,0.97,6069.63,6071.365,I wanted to go and ask.,191,,
950,0.97,6071.365,6084.111,One of bullets that's pretty prominent in the survey results though it's not indicated I don't think in a chart reference in the presentation is the preference on picking a day closure.,191,,
951,0.97,6084.111,6090.184,The exercise and the survey of picking a potential day closure of Monday.,191,,
952,0.97,6090.184,6097.558,I guess I just want to ask what--what--is the library going to use that information to inform.,191,,
953,0.97,6097.558,6110.737,Is that just sort of to gauge the volume of patron activity or the library going to consider the exercise in shortening hours to expand access at other times in.,191,,
954,0.97,6110.737,6117.044,I think one of the things we were doing is we were looking at either a Friday or Monday type of situation.,192,,
955,0.97,6117.044,6135.929,"One of the reasons we why looking at that is we were crafting this--this is back last Yeara the time the Clipper Funs were being talked about the Federal funds for libraries to give us that boost to Rehire those 60, 70 policies that we were reduce.",192,,
956,0.97,6135.929,6142.769,"We were looking at Okay, what happens if we have to go backwards in this?",192,,
957,0.97,6142.769,6146.807,We didn't sustain ours moving forward if these reductions stay in place.,192,,
958,0.97,6146.807,6153.947,"Even as we move forward, knowing that budget reductions are always a potential reality, even as they may be this year.",192,,
959,0.97,6153.947,6171.765,"Question wanted to mechanic sure that we had options so if we can't move forward as far as we want to in either Prepandemic services or expanded hours, that we are letting our public provide some input into that process of where we would make that selection.",192,,
960,0.97,6171.765,6175.335,I think that is where we were going with it.,192,,
961,0.97,6175.335,6176.703,Trying to have a good idea.,192,,
962,0.97,6176.703,6189.016,"Most Wassa pound the hours that would be more effective for patrons and most of them at one point when we did the survey in 2018, there was more interest at night.",192,,
963,0.97,6189.016,6192.653,Now that has swung and there is more interest in morning hours.,192,,
964,0.97,6192.653,6203.864,We are taking that information and working with our scheduling folks at the library to figure out what our schedules may look like in the number of different situations.,192,,
965,0.97,6203.864,6205.966,I appreciate that clarity.,193,,
966,0.97,6205.966,6209.269,Was there another--from the Council?,193,,
967,0.97,6209.269,6209.57,Sorry.,194,,
968,0.97,6209.57,6210.871,Sorry.,195,,
969,0.97,6210.871,6212.839,Did I interrupt a Panelist on the computer?,195,,
970,0.97,6212.839,6219.913,I'm trying to keep track of everybody.,195,,
971,0.97,6219.913,6221.915,I--JA N. do head.,195,,
972,0.97,6221.915,6222.649,Sorry.,195,,
973,0.97,6222.649,6228.689,We currently--Prepandemic schedule had nine branches closed on Fridays.,196,,
974,0.97,6228.689,6236.83,The question was in part about whether patrons preferred Friday closures to other days of the week.,196,,
