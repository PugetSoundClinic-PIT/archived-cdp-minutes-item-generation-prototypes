239,0.97,1377.909,1390.055,"Thank you colleagues, you perhaps if you recall that this approval was in November, 2019.",37,,
240,0.97,1390.055,1394.226,This is a portion of 39Th Avenue South.,37,,
241,0.97,1394.226,1399.898,It was requested originally to facilitate the construction of 211 units.,37,,
242,0.97,1399.898,1401.032,For low income housing projects.,37,,

245,0.97,1410.442,1425.123,Some discounts and rollovers were there we are essentially recognizing that the Sdot has met and will meet the benefit of the public previously adopted by the city.,37,,

250,0.97,1444.943,1449.448,This is one of the first projects that was approved under the revised policies.,38,,
251,0.97,1449.448,1461.693,Those revisions allowed for the reconsideration of the uses of the street including affordable housing.,38,,
252,0.97,1461.693,1470.669,The public benefits you will see as part of this project reflect the significant amount of affordable housing.,38,,
253,0.97,1470.669,1488.253,"And Consequently, there are fewer and smaller public benefits . than what example we saw was the office development in downtown Seattle that we would supporting.",38,,
254,0.97,1488.253,1489.154,Just to clarify.,39,,
255,0.97,1489.154,1493.558,"For me, that is because the vacation, itself has produced another benefit for that is the affordable housing.",39,,
256,0.97,1493.558,1496.061,Exactly.,40,,
257,0.97,1496.061,1498.697,"Without that, the affordable housing would not have gone forward.",40,,

261,0.97,1511.176,1514.346,I would just like to add a couple of things to what he said.,42,,
262,0.97,1514.346,1516.681,"Thank you, this is always fun for us to be back.",42,,
263,0.97,1516.681,1532.364,"In a project is done . and was implemented, as directed by counsel Parker this is the very last piece.",42,,
264,0.97,1532.364,1534.432,We are very happy to be here with this.,42,,
265,0.97,1534.432,1538.236,And I think that he Referenced a couple of things that are really important about this process.,42,,
266,0.97,1538.236,1540.205,This is so often associated with really large scale projects.,42,,
267,0.97,1540.205,1545.777,"The last one within was at segment and university, downtown for we always think of the convention center.",42,,
268,0.97,1545.777,1546.411,Or Amazon projects.,42,,
269,0.97,1546.411,1558.59,But occasionally we do get a smaller scale projects . The Council Street vacation policy really provided for a balancing test for we looked at what the developer achieved.,42,,
270,0.97,1558.59,1573.972,And what's the public will give up when we are assessing the impact that needed to be mitigated . and at what level the public benefits should be provided.,42,,
271,0.97,1573.972,1575.373,We will look at a smaller project.,42,,
272,0.97,1575.373,1584.449,"But we still want to see meaningful, but everything is in a more modest scale.",42,,
273,0.97,1584.449,1585.317,Policies provide for that.,42,,
274,0.97,1585.317,1587.719,Even though we do not see a lot of smaller projects.,42,,
275,0.97,1587.719,1591.089,Another important item is the two part approval process that the city Council has established.,42,,
276,0.97,1591.089,1591.623,At the time.,42,,
277,0.97,1591.623,1596.194,In this was approved in 2019.,42,,
278,0.97,1596.194,1607.105,"At the time that it was approved for the Council and made the substantive decision for going the developer, city staff, and myself and everybody will review this.",42,,
279,0.97,1607.105,1608.84,"They need to implement, as directed by counsel.",42,,
280,0.97,1608.84,1627.192,This final ordinance is an accountability tool that the Council has established for we can come back in and say yes Parker the public benefit that was proposed was provided for the housing benefits are provided.,42,,
281,0.97,1627.192,1627.993,The fees are paid.,42,,
282,0.97,1627.993,1628.86,Everything is done.,42,,
283,0.97,1628.86,1631.029,"So this, as we are indicated at the very last step.",42,,
284,0.97,1631.029,1636.501,As I mentioned to.,42,,
285,0.97,1636.501,1637.569,This is our favorite part.,42,,

309,0.97,1726.424,1730.462,And it was designed that way.,46,,
310,0.97,1730.462,1735.467,We acquired the parcel along Mlk.,46,,
311,0.97,1735.467,1740.672,In addition to additional parcels along South willow street.,46,,

444,0.97,2441.438,2453.984,"In terms of the key, city rolls per can we play a lot of different roles on this project.",62,,
445,0.97,2453.984,2456.12,Obviously we have been a strong supporter from its inception.,62,,
446,0.97,2456.12,2469.266,And we play all of these roles are critical of what we are bringing forward today.,62,,

448,0.97,2477.875,2480.711,In the final Ies for the city is a cooperative agency on Ies.,62,,
449,0.97,2480.711,2483.647,Because we have an entire set of regulatory rules that we play.,62,,
450,0.97,2483.647,2487.651,In terms of permitting A. code compliance.,62,,
451,0.97,2487.651,2491.789,"And insurance, ultimately that the project can advance efficiently through the permitting proxies us.",62,,
452,0.97,2491.789,2499.43,We also play a critical role in communities.,62,,
453,0.97,2499.43,2503.133,We make sure that the full range of impacts are fully considered and addressed to the environmental process.,62,,
454,0.97,2503.133,2506.904,One of the key tools that we have brought to the conversation is the racial equity Toolkit.,62,,
455,0.97,2506.904,2525.99,Not only that we avoid impact but we are looking to make every opportunity for the system investment to benefit the community that it serves.,62,,
456,0.97,2525.99,2526.257,Lastly.,62,,
457,0.97,2526.257,2528.192,In 2018 the city established a Partnering agreement.,62,,
458,0.97,2528.192,2528.659,With sound transit.,62,,

461,0.97,2533.23,2536.467,And even intensive staff work that takes place.,62,,
462,0.97,2536.467,2546.877,It is led through Sdot.,62,,
463,0.97,2550.981,2554.184,"And ultimately, a commitment to to look at how we can streamline the permitting process.",62,,

465,0.97,2555.986,2558.956,And as the project starts to do our final preparation and permitting.,62,,
466,0.97,2558.956,2565.863,Let me end with this.,62,,
467,0.97,2565.863,2570.935,"For the review itself, the city is also a reviewer and a regulator.",62,,
468,0.97,2570.935,2572.903,Our focus is on advancing the city's interest.,62,,

472,0.97,2583.514,2586.75,Let me emphasize it is normal and necessary.,62,,
473,0.97,2586.75,2595.292,That we would be calling out certain issues and asking for more analysis and more medication from transit.,62,,
474,0.97,2595.292,2596.493,Why that is so critical?,62,,
475,0.97,2596.493,2607.871,To ensure that we are Well- positioned to facilitate the permitting of the project.,62,,
476,0.97,2607.871,2611.308,If we do not fully address impact and understand what Mitigations will be required now?,62,,
477,0.97,2611.308,2613.911,It makes it more challenging to streamline the permitting process down the road.,62,,
478,0.97,2613.911,2615.846,"With that, let me send handed over to Sarah.",62,,
479,0.97,2615.846,2616.714,"Thank you, Marshall.",63,,

485,0.97,2647.745,2655.886,With a focus on the Deis to improve their access.,63,,
486,0.97,2655.886,2668.298,"The Deis is a very dense, information packet document for we want to help facilitate community members being able to understand the document.",63,,
487,0.97,2668.298,2675.172,And understand how it applies to the impact.,63,,
488,0.97,2675.172,2677.341,And the opportunities they could see in their neighborhood.,63,,

554,0.97,2964.361,2977.908,Does the Deis demonstrate compliance?,63,,
555,0.97,2982.612,2984.281,Does the Deis identify and evaluate project impact?,63,,
556,0.97,2984.281,2985.449,That setting include appropriate mitigation?,63,,
557,0.97,2985.449,2990.987,"And ultimately, does Deis provide information that the city in the Stakeholders and community members can compare the alternatives? and have a decision?",63,,
558,0.97,2990.987,2993.623,But in addition to those legal questions that we are asking of ourselves.,63,,
559,0.97,2993.623,2999.396,"We also had a couple of strategic questions to ask, as well.",63,,
560,0.97,2999.396,3001.765,Number 4. does the Deis adequately analyze communities.,63,,
561,0.97,3001.765,3015.579,And propose mitigation and provide racial tool equity it's . and also it is not part of the environmental review process directly.,63,,
562,0.97,3015.579,3021.418,But it is something that we are still jointly with sound transit to use . and finally.,63,,
563,0.97,3021.418,3028.458,How does this Deis information shape the decision and alternatives?,63,,
564,0.97,3028.458,3034.765,We will use these five questions to talk about the cities staff draft of review.,63,,
565,0.97,3034.765,3046.009,"Number one, does the Deis demonstrate compliance with rules?",63,,
566,0.97,3046.009,3049.379,In the summary of our findings is that we would like to see additional compliance.,63,,
567,0.97,3049.379,3050.047,It is really critical.,63,,
568,0.97,3050.047,3060.023,"In ultimately, the final that we see evidence . that the project is going to comply with code.",63,,
569,0.97,3060.023,3061.291,If we do not see that?,63,,
570,0.97,3061.291,3071.368,"We cannot flag whether there is going to be code Compliant issues down the road in many instances, we are looking for the municipal code . to make sure that we would meet the project minimum code requirements necessary.",63,,
571,0.97,3071.368,3072.969,And there are a couple of examples.,63,,
572,0.97,3072.969,3084.581,"Such as the shoreline, Stormwater, and trees environmental.",63,,
573,0.97,3084.581,3101.865,Does this adequately identify and evaluate the project impact.,63,,
574,0.97,3101.865,3102.365,And include mitigation?,63,,
575,0.97,3102.365,3104.034,This is the heart of what we do.,63,,
576,0.97,3104.034,3104.701,Looking at impact.,63,,
577,0.97,3104.701,3110.807,And identifying the mitigation for we knew it at a draft document that the draft document was not going to include the full entirety of the mitigation plan.,63,,
578,0.97,3110.807,3112.075,It was totally normal for us.,63,,
579,0.97,3112.075,3116.78,To be calling out that there are many instances where we want to see Additionalalysis.,63,,
580,0.97,3116.78,3119.449,To fully assess and mitigate the impact.,63,,

602,0.97,3208.538,3209.406,For the downtown segment.,63,,
603,0.97,3209.406,3216.413,It is in as a tunnel alignment alternative from Chinatown International district.,63,,
604,0.97,3216.413,3221.885,Due South Interbay.,63,,
605,0.97,3221.885,3226.623,Some of the impacts and issues that we would like to see fully mitigated the.,63,,

607,0.97,3232.596,3240.537,And I will have a following side that focuses just on the Seattle center . to the regional facility for access to ramps to I-5 program and street closures.,63,,
608,0.97,3240.537,3243.173,Identified with the construction.,63,,
609,0.97,3243.173,3251.314,They were related to the construction impacts of the tunnel alternatives.,63,,
610,0.97,3251.314,3256.086,Especially West Lake Avenue program the types of impact that would be city bus diversion from closed streets.,63,,

617,0.97,3304.768,3311.141,And that could impact residence during construction or long Termimpacts to historic assets including the Northwestern Playhouse.,63,,
618,0.97,3311.141,3324.154,And also this would impact during construction.,63,,
619,0.97,3324.154,3324.587,Continuing down.,63,,
620,0.97,3324.587,3332.395,This is Chinatown International district.,63,,

629,0.97,3368.465,3371.735,And impact to cultural resources and sites.,63,,
630,0.97,3371.735,3374.738,And finally closing it out to.,63,,
631,0.97,3374.738,3377.941,In the final three segments.,63,,

638,0.97,3402.365,3416.446,I think that closes us out with a high level of impacts program and of course this project is going to be Impactful . I just wanted to emphasize the normalcy of talking about these impacts at this point.,63,,
639,0.97,3416.446,3416.88,And the process.,63,,
640,0.97,3416.88,3419.416,And the critical juncture that we are at right now.,63,,
641,0.97,3419.416,3425.288,Two recognize mitigation measures.,63,,
642,0.97,3425.288,3425.955,Thank you.,64,,

645,0.97,3433.129,3434.03,The third question.,65,,
646,0.97,3434.03,3442.071,Does this provide the information necessary to meaningful provide alternatives.,65,,
647,0.97,3442.071,3444.407,In summary we believe that there is more information that is needed.,65,,
648,0.97,3444.407,3450.146,And a couple of the segments in order to fully understand and compare the alternatives.,65,,
649,0.97,3450.146,3450.947,The two segments.,65,,
650,0.97,3450.947,3452.582,The first that we would like to highlight.,65,,
651,0.97,3452.582,3457.454,It includes a South Interbay segment for the North portal and the downtown tunnel.,65,,
652,0.97,3457.454,3458.855,In two of the three alternatives.,65,,
653,0.97,3458.855,3472.502,This comes out at a Republican and a go across Elliott way to we would like to see additional mitigation for the impact for the construction and the operation of that elevated area.,65,,
654,0.97,3472.502,3477.874,We would also like to see compliance with noise reduction.,65,,
655,0.97,3477.874,3489.752,"For number two, number three, both would have an impact to the queen and belt and the state slope . including environmental areas.",65,,
656,0.97,3489.752,3499.195,We would like to see either mitigation or avoidance of those areas.,65,,
657,0.97,3499.195,3501.097,The impact and also compliance with noise regulation.,65,,
658,0.97,3501.097,3504.334,We feel that this information is necessary to fully evaluate and understand comparison of the alternatives.,65,,
659,0.97,3504.334,3505.969,The other place and other segment.,65,,
660,0.97,3505.969,3516.679,With this it would like to see additional information to support a full understanding in comparison to the alternatives is the Chinatown International district.,65,,
661,0.97,3516.679,3522.919,For this is the fifth Avenue in the alternatives.,65,,
662,0.97,3522.919,3525.521,We would like to see avoidance or mitigation for transportation impact.,65,,
663,0.97,3525.521,3540.136,Associate with the road closure . and the replacement of the fourth Avenue bridge structure.,65,,
664,0.97,3540.136,3556.019,"For 2A, this is the fifth Avenue shallow and deep alternatives for we would like to see avoidance, mitigation for the business impact associated with those alternative options.",65,,
665,0.97,3556.019,3557.353,And for all of the alternatives.,65,,
666,0.97,3557.353,3561.591,"We would like to see a committee process and analysis needed on how to avoid and minimize the impacts, overall.",65,,
667,0.97,3561.591,3564.227,How to fully advance the outcome and address the historic harm.,65,,
668,0.97,3564.227,3569.265,Moving from those three technical questions that we were approaching.,65,,
669,0.97,3569.265,3578.675,And from Deis to strategic with the city's values . The first is the does the Deis adequately analyze communities.,65,,
670,0.97,3578.675,3588.117,Or using the racial outcome.,65,,
671,0.97,3588.117,3590.72,And our summaries that we would like to see additional analysis.,65,,
672,0.97,3590.72,3591.387,There are several instances.,65,,
673,0.97,3591.387,3596.125,We find the evaluation is inefficient or inadequate.,65,,
674,0.97,3596.125,3596.793,Here are some examples.,65,,
675,0.97,3596.793,3602.231,There is a lot of analysis in this document.,65,,
676,0.97,3602.231,3604.667,But we would like to see additional work on the methodology.,65,,
677,0.97,3604.667,3606.603,And more analysis of the displacement of affordable housing.,65,,
678,0.97,3606.603,3613.91,Perfectly in Dell ridge . We would like to see an additional analysis to small business displacement.,65,,
679,0.97,3613.91,3614.544,The cumulative impact.,65,,
680,0.97,3614.544,3615.945,And also in Chinatown International district.,65,,
681,0.97,3615.945,3626.255,Not just locally but also a fully flesh that out.,65,,
682,0.97,3626.255,3626.889,And of course ultimately.,65,,
683,0.97,3626.889,3627.357,The medication.,65,,
684,0.97,3627.357,3629.726,We want to see an update to wreck racial equity Toolkit.,65,,
685,0.97,3629.726,3631.461,A draft was issued with Deis.,65,,
686,0.97,3631.461,3637.2,This will be updated later this year for we would like to continue that partnership.,65,,

690,0.97,3651.948,3669.065,"And also this Deis information feeds into a city position and community Stakeholders on the alternatives that will inform the actions . and we find that for many of the segments, the Deis provides necessary information.",65,,
691,0.97,3669.065,3673.87,For a local alternative.,65,,
692,0.97,3673.87,3684.113,"But we also see additional analysis and Processesin South Interbay, as we mentioned, additional analysis of compliance.",65,,

700,0.97,3710.74,3721.284,Or to find a way to ensure the optimal transit at South Lake and Harrison.,65,,
701,0.97,3721.284,3732.295,Cid we seek additional analysis as we mentioned earlier on the impact and mitigation.,65,,
702,0.97,3732.295,3745.875,But also an additional suggestion that this would be a Three-Step process.,65,,
703,0.97,3745.875,3746.476,As a graph.,65,,
704,0.97,3746.476,3747.11,Is a concept.,65,,
705,0.97,3747.11,3761.891,One will provide a time for the by removing the pressure to identify the alternative . and also to explore mitigation more fully with an alternative that is on the table are going to press for stronger refinements to minimize those impacts to the committee.,65,,
706,0.97,3761.891,3767.263,And also a longer-term partnership . to tackle those impacts.,65,,
707,0.97,3767.263,3774.203,And addressing harm to conversations.,65,,

762,0.97,4079.475,4090.953,There is a consensus that it could be useful for the city council.,66,,

776,0.97,4150.446,4153.082,There are huge Trade-Offs for either one of those options.,67,,

780,0.97,4177.54,4185.648,I think that committee had more time and would need more time to understand what is in front of them.,67,,
781,0.97,4185.648,4195.858,So we can move forward protecting people and businesses.,67,,

791,0.97,4221.517,4230.025,I do not know if my comments for this or the next agenda item . I guess I just a clarifying question.,69,,
792,0.97,4230.025,4243.172,The implication of submitting the questions for to sound transit for the panel.,69,,
793,0.97,4243.172,4249.111,Does of submitting questions before the April 28th deadline locked the city in?,69,,
794,0.97,4249.111,4257.62,To provide the preferred alternative for the alignment?,69,,
795,0.97,4257.62,4265.294,If we are not emphatic about some of our issues . I understand asking questions.,69,,
796,0.97,4265.294,4267.896,About how the alignment will impact certain areas.,69,,
797,0.97,4267.896,4280.943,But there are parts of this . I would want the Council to be more emphatic before the comment period ends . Before clearly stating what we do or do not want.,69,,
798,0.97,4280.943,4282.444,And I guess my question would be.,69,,
799,0.97,4282.444,4284.279,If we phrase it in questions.,69,,
800,0.97,4284.279,4293.889,Does that mean that we are talking about changing the boundaries on the preferred alternatives?,69,,
801,0.97,4293.889,4298.961,But not explicitly Impacting the alignments.,69,,
802,0.97,4298.961,4300.095,I just want to answer that.,69,,
803,0.97,4300.095,4305.634,As a threshold question in terms of that resolution.,69,,
804,0.97,4305.634,4312.708,I would like that document to be very unambiguous.,69,,
805,0.97,4312.708,4313.375,"Thank you, Lewis.",70,,
806,0.97,4313.375,4314.41,What an excellent question.,70,,
807,0.97,4314.41,4315.31,I had the same question.,70,,
808,0.97,4315.31,4323.719,"We have the formal, official EIS comment period.",70,,
809,0.97,4323.719,4326.088,But we are also waiting to hear were the comments are.,70,,
810,0.97,4326.088,4328.19,And we want to express what our consensus is.,70,,
811,0.97,4328.19,4330.559,I note that we have Calvin and Marshall already to answer.,70,,
812,0.97,4330.559,4332.895,Whoever wants to jump in,70,,
813,0.97,4332.895,4338.367,"Thank you . I think that Councilmember, Luis.",71,,
814,0.97,4338.367,4351.88,It is effective to think about this is a two draft.,71,,
815,0.97,4352.815,4354.516,"This first is a formal, environmental review process.",71,,
816,0.97,4354.516,4356.652,Our experts are highlighting very specific issues with the analysis.,71,,
817,0.97,4356.652,4358.587,It does not establish the city's formal policy position.,71,,
818,0.97,4358.587,4361.223,Our intention is to put forth resolutions to gather information.,71,,
819,0.97,4361.223,4368.897,And try to find the common policy position for the city from elected officials.,71,,
820,0.97,4368.897,4372.768,And have a joint Council Mayor resolution to establish that position.,71,,
821,0.97,4372.768,4375.104,As recommendation to the sound transit board.,71,,
822,0.97,4375.104,4384.68,It would be helpful to the President and the Mayor as they represent the city's interest.,71,,
823,0.97,4384.68,4388.417,So I do think that we have an opportunity for the resolution to be specific.,71,,
824,0.97,4388.417,4396.992,As the body can get . But the policy decision should be left to that resolution.,71,,
825,0.97,4396.992,4405.834,And sever to the more technical comments that are going to be coming from the draft comments.,71,,
826,0.97,4405.834,4408.47,Sound transit will have to respond to all the comments as they get.,71,,
827,0.97,4408.47,4411.106,This will be part of the logging that come through the Deis.,71,,
828,0.97,4411.106,4420.682,They will have to note how they are responding to these questions and track at.,71,,
829,0.97,4420.682,4423.085,I will be curious to see how that will be tracked.,71,,
830,0.97,4423.085,4424.787,Marshall?,72,,
831,0.97,4424.787,4425.654,Him just briefly.,72,,
832,0.97,4425.654,4432.194,I completely Re-With Calvin . It is really a two step process for let me emphasize.,72,,
833,0.97,4432.194,4449.478,The comments are about completeness and adequacy of the Deis document.,72,,
834,0.97,4449.478,4450.746,Anonymously mitigation as part of that.,72,,
835,0.97,4450.746,4451.613,From the executive side?,72,,
836,0.97,4451.613,4454.216,We would also like to be specific with that second step.,72,,
837,0.97,4454.216,4455.717,It is the Mayo Council resolution call out.,72,,
838,0.97,4455.717,4456.618,Specific preferences.,72,,
839,0.97,4456.618,4458.02,For the Mayor Council.- officially answers my questions.,72,,
840,0.97,4458.02,4461.89,"Thank you, Luis.",73,,
841,0.97,4461.89,4465.494,And Anna we'll have more comments and questions.,73,,
842,0.97,4465.494,4469.798,Them just a couple of comments.,73,,
843,0.97,4469.798,4471.733,And a couple of questions broke on the comments side.,73,,
844,0.97,4471.733,4484.713,Let me think Sdot for a couple of statements . In this presentation . First I really appreciate the note.,73,,
845,0.97,4484.713,4489.718,There is additional analysis needed by proper placement.,73,,
846,0.97,4489.718,4495.691,And even affordable housing in Dell ridge.,73,,
847,0.97,4495.691,4521.984,"We know that small businesses have struggled during the construction of the H-Line . and I think that we need to know how we can do more to support small businesses during construction . Also, I wanted to appreciate the fact that slide 26.",73,,
848,0.97,4521.984,4523.619,The city stated its position on preferred alternatives.,73,,
849,0.97,4523.619,4527.256,You have lifted up how important it is to emphasize transit Connectivity.,73,,
850,0.97,4527.256,4530.259,In the context of the Southern portions.,73,,
851,0.97,4530.259,4537.9,Writers from lower income and other committees will access by city bus.,73,,
852,0.97,4537.9,4544.94,And also I appreciate that the city is saying loud and clearly.,73,,
853,0.97,4544.94,4547.943,We discourage smoke reduction.,73,,
854,0.97,4547.943,4557.019,It is not bring a benefit to membership or riders.,73,,
855,0.97,4557.019,4560.255,And that was not promised to voters in number three in 2016.,73,,
856,0.97,4560.255,4567.429,This position is shared by a lot of people that are in comment with West Seattle.,73,,
857,0.97,4567.429,4573.201,And a potential smoke reduction must bring a comparable benefit to the the.,73,,
858,0.97,4573.201,4574.736,And my two questions.,73,,
859,0.97,4574.736,4575.971,On slide number 17.,73,,
860,0.97,4575.971,4589.451,You Referenced the Cid station and Sodo.,73,,
861,0.97,4589.451,4590.586,The fourth Avenue impact Southbridge.,73,,
862,0.97,4590.586,4592.888,Could you talk a little bit more about that.,73,,
863,0.97,4592.888,4597.459,And I am also interested to hear from you.,73,,
864,0.97,4597.459,4607.803,How the city is Gauging residential and business displacement.,73,,
865,0.97,4607.803,4616.244,Given the process alternatives have varying impacts as it relates to both residential and business displacement.,73,,
866,0.97,4616.244,4622.818,Thank you.,73,,
867,0.97,4622.818,4623.919,Let me just jump in.,74,,
868,0.97,4623.919,4627.556,"And to Sarah, please follow.",74,,
869,0.97,4627.556,4633.595,Councilmember to speak to the fourth Avenue question.,74,,
870,0.97,4633.595,4634.696,When we are Referencing that.,74,,
871,0.97,4634.696,4636.198,In terms of the bridge structure.,74,,
872,0.97,4636.198,4637.632,Is the fourth Avenue bridge shallow option.,74,,
873,0.97,4637.632,4649.077,The station construction requires the fourth Avenue Viaduct structure . It is basically a bridge Structur for that the fourth Avenue is on.,74,,
874,0.97,4649.077,4653.615,As the segment passes Union station to Jackson.,74,,
875,0.97,4653.615,4655.784,That is part of what I think Sarah was describing.,74,,
876,0.97,4655.784,4661.923,We need a more in depth assessment on how to advance the fourth Avenue shallow.,74,,
877,0.97,4661.923,4666.728,"And others, as well.",74,,
878,0.97,4666.728,4668.897,A deeper dive into really understanding what is that impact.,74,,
879,0.97,4668.897,4675.17,What is the most efficient way to address that bridge structure as far as advancing that alternative.,74,,
880,0.97,4675.17,4687.416,"Sarah, do you want to speak to Dell ridge?",74,,
881,0.97,4688.85,4689.217,Yes.,75,,
882,0.97,4689.217,4690.519,And I would say more broadly.,75,,
883,0.97,4690.519,4693.422,The question of how is the city staff team looking at residential displacement.,75,,
884,0.97,4693.422,4694.389,And all of the alternatives.,75,,
885,0.97,4694.389,4698.06,I would say that we do not have one single threshold that we are trying to stay beneath.,75,,
886,0.97,4698.06,4706.735,Whether we are trying to take a station by station is our community by community lock.,75,,
887,0.97,4706.735,4708.27,We will compare this within the alternatives.,75,,
888,0.97,4708.27,4708.904,With the Cid example.,75,,
889,0.97,4708.904,4710.238,The alternatives for business displacement.,75,,
890,0.97,4710.238,4711.707,It would vary from five to 19.,75,,
891,0.97,4711.707,4712.174,19 businesses.,75,,
892,0.97,4712.174,4716.478,"When you look at another station at another area, there could be hundreds.",75,,
893,0.97,4716.478,4725.42,But what do these particular Displacements mean in this community?,75,,
894,0.97,4725.42,4728.523,A dozen Displacements in the heart of Cid district is going to be very Impactful.,75,,
895,0.97,4728.523,4734.629,So trying to take that more Nuanced to look for in Dell ridge.,75,,
896,0.97,4734.629,4743.405,There are a couple of different things that are influencing how the city staff is approaching Dell ridge.,75,,
897,0.97,4743.405,4752.38,There is identified priorities or rent identified for the Dell ridge community park on those who you the opportunity to provide equity development.,75,,
898,0.97,4752.38,4759.588,And really creating that seamless and fast as possible transit integration.,75,,
899,0.97,4759.588,4767.529,Councilmember is mentioned for those committee members that are coming from the further South.,75,,
900,0.97,4767.529,4769.231,Those outcomes are our leading Differentiators.,75,,
901,0.97,4769.231,4774.169,We are trying to use when we think about Dell ridge for we are also looking at the displacement associated.,75,,
902,0.97,4774.169,4781.943,Particular with the Dell ridge alternatives.,75,,
903,0.97,4781.943,4784.379,Those are the alternative options that are further South in Dell ridge.,75,,
904,0.97,4784.379,4797.559,That brings a lot more impact to the businesses along Dell ridge way.,75,,
905,0.97,4797.559,4799.194,As well as the case in Dakota.,75,,
906,0.97,4799.194,4800.695,With a considerable amount of residential displacement.,75,,
907,0.97,4800.695,4819.08,Even just a couple of city blocks for but we are acknowledging those and showing the other alternatives that displacement . Idential I hope that fully understand your question or answers your question.,75,,
908,0.97,4819.08,4820.348,It is not completely cut and dry.,75,,
909,0.97,4820.348,4822.717,The types of displacement vary from one station to the other.,75,,
910,0.97,4822.717,4824.252,But we want to take a tailored,75,,
911,0.97,4824.252,4825.887,"Thank you, Sarah.",76,,
912,0.97,4825.887,4827.589,It is not an easy question to approach.,76,,
913,0.97,4827.589,4829.124,I appreciate that.,76,,
914,0.97,4829.124,4829.858,Calvin?,77,,
915,0.97,4829.858,4838.2,Mm let me add to Seras answer.,77,,
916,0.97,4838.2,4838.867,From my perspective.,77,,
917,0.97,4838.867,4840.602,I think the comments on displacement right now.,77,,
918,0.97,4840.602,4846.041,Is in the Deis about trying to make sure that the information is Conceptualized.,77,,
919,0.97,4846.041,4853.715,And developed enough so readers and the Decision-Makers have a full picture in front of them.,77,,
920,0.97,4853.715,4859.487,That will be in our resolution.,77,,
921,0.97,4859.487,4860.589,"Ultimately, they can take action.",77,,
922,0.97,4860.589,4865.093,And also for the direct decision.,77,,
923,0.97,4865.093,4869.798,I think it is going to be up to the policymakers to ultimately do that.,77,,
924,0.97,4869.798,4876.404,And I think the job right now is to make sure they have the best affirmation available.,77,,
925,0.97,4876.404,4883.979,Thank you.,78,,
926,0.97,4883.979,4886.548,"Marshall, Sarah, Calvin I appreciate this thorough, thorough analysis of the Deis.",78,,
927,0.97,4886.548,4891.953,And the biggest context of what we are trying to achieve.,78,,
928,0.97,4891.953,4894.022,And the tools that we can use.,78,,
929,0.97,4894.022,4897.559,To synthesize our consensus.,78,,
930,0.97,4897.559,4908.603,And be very specific we will be back on the 17th.,78,,
931,0.97,4908.603,4911.039,"And colleagues, please direct connect with Marshall and Sarah.",78,,
932,0.97,4911.039,4923.118,"And also we have other Councilmembers here, as our President.",78,,
933,0.97,4923.118,4925.453,"With that, we are going to move into the next item.",78,,
934,0.97,4925.453,4939.234,We have sound transit staff here for Marshall and Sarah are looking to stick around.,78,,
935,0.97,4940.902,4945.507,And can we read the short title of the next agenda item into the record.,78,,
936,0.97,4945.507,4960.922,Number 4 sound transit West Seattle and Ballard link extensions: cost savings and refinement concepts this is for briefing and discussion.,79,,
937,0.97,4960.922,4961.556,Thank you.,80,,
938,0.97,4961.556,4963.124,And let me welcome back sound transit.,80,,
939,0.97,4963.124,4972.267,We received an extensive presentation . that was at our meeting and we also from sound transit last June.,80,,
940,0.97,4972.267,4976.171,They do have a Powerpoint.,80,,
941,0.97,4976.171,4980.208,It looks very long.,80,,
942,0.97,4980.208,4984.112,But as I understand it it is more of a reference document.,80,,
943,0.97,4984.112,4992.087,And sound transit will just be touching on the most relevant and important slides.,80,,
944,0.97,4992.087,4996.124,They can refer back to whatever slides they would like to refer to.,80,,
945,0.97,4996.124,5006.768,"And so we can enable them to prison for - fish in our presentations, let us hold our questions to the end.",80,,
946,0.97,5006.768,5010.638,"Councilmembers, want to give everybody plenty of time to convey their thoughts.",80,,
947,0.97,5010.638,5018.847,And asked questions.,80,,
948,0.97,5018.847,5022.083,"Right now, we are going to hear about some preliminary concepts from sound transit staff.",80,,
949,0.97,5022.083,5022.917,On cost savings ideas.,80,,
950,0.97,5022.917,5029.324,And I know that we want to be mindful of what we just heard.,80,,
951,0.97,5029.324,5030.859,From our designated representative.,80,,
952,0.97,5030.859,5033.728,And Sdot and Councilmembers.,80,,
953,0.97,5033.728,5039.267,Not just trimming the scope prematurely on this project.,80,,
954,0.97,5039.267,5044.372,So we can see what voters were expecting.,80,,
955,0.97,5044.372,5048.91,"Nevertheless, it is very useful when we start taking about this.",80,,
956,0.97,5048.91,5052.58,Let us jump into this presentation.,80,,
957,0.97,5052.58,5059.22,You can go ahead and display that.,80,,
958,0.97,5059.22,5060.755,And I want to welcome you in.,80,,
959,0.97,5060.755,5065.326,"Thank you members of the committee, thank you Alex Pedersen.",81,,
960,0.97,5065.326,5076.604,And I am joined . If this Slideshow were to appear on the screen?,81,,
961,0.97,5076.604,5077.539,I could proceed.,81,,
962,0.97,5077.539,5090.518,[Laughter] But let me just say and a repeat of what you just sit up or go there is a lot of information here.,81,,
963,0.97,5090.518,5096.558,Much of this you have Seenso let me just slide over these briefly . to provide some context.,81,,
964,0.97,5096.558,5103.264,And I will spend most of my time describing the cost savings and the refinement ideas that we have.,81,,
965,0.97,5103.264,5109.337,Sharing with our community advisory groups and other forms in the last few weeks.,81,,
966,0.97,5109.337,5117.045,I could probably do it from here.,81,,
967,0.97,5117.045,5119.814,I thought you were going to show them for us.,82,,
968,0.97,5119.814,5120.882,I could do that also.,83,,
969,0.97,5120.882,5121.549,[Laughter].,83,,
970,0.97,5121.549,5127.055,"I am sorry, I guess I misunderstood.",84,,
971,0.97,5127.055,5127.455,As I mentioned.,84,,
972,0.97,5127.455,5138.867,Let me go with the Firstthis is a big project over to to the third concept which is cost savings.,84,,
973,0.97,5138.867,5144.139,"As everyone knows, we've been working on this project for four, five years.",84,,
974,0.97,5144.139,5149.377,We went through a alternative process and aware in the environmental review phase.,84,,
975,0.97,5149.377,5151.546,And also public comments.,84,,
976,0.97,5151.546,5156.184,The graphic on the left shows the Snapshot of all the alternatives.,84,,
977,0.97,5156.184,5163.391,They were studied in the Deis.,84,,
978,0.97,5163.391,5164.259,This identified other alternatives.,84,,
979,0.97,5164.259,5168.73,And also look through a number of other alternatives progrowth they were all studied deeply in the Deis.,84,,
980,0.97,5168.73,5184.145,And essentially the action before the board is to confirm or modify the actions that we took in 2019.,84,,
981,0.97,5185.246,5188.449,This is just a Snapshot of what we've been going over for the last few months.,84,,
982,0.97,5188.449,5190.051,The shaded area is a public comment.,84,,
983,0.97,5190.051,5191.719,This began on January to late April.,84,,
984,0.97,5191.719,5193.421,Right at the top we had our public meeting.,84,,
985,0.97,5193.421,5200.728,For Deis and we've been working with Mindy advisory groups and meeting with them since November on a monthly basis.,84,,
986,0.97,5200.728,5217.712,"Will be working with our Minis for the next few months for alluding to board action to provide alternatives for the month of Juneas noted, this is the focus of our communications this month.",84,,
987,0.97,5217.712,5225.687,Beyond the Deis and the cost savings and refinement ideas.,84,,
988,0.97,5225.687,5227.622,We have been doing a lot of engagement.,84,,
989,0.97,5227.622,5230.625,This is a Snapshot of our engagement since January until April.,84,,
990,0.97,5230.625,5232.327,This is a little bit out of date.,84,,
991,0.97,5232.327,5237.398,But this will does give you in the sense of the engagement that has been going on through this comment ..,84,,
992,0.97,5237.398,5238.6,As this relates about 820 comments.,84,,
993,0.97,5238.6,5247.842,"We had our five draft meetings per completed 10,000 businesses attend our Online forums.",84,,
994,0.97,5247.842,5255.383,With 38 Webinars per code 10 advisory group meetings.,84,,
995,0.97,5255.383,5258.853,"And you can see on the right, a lot of Statistics on the social media.",84,,
996,0.97,5258.853,5272.433,Quickly just to Recap in February.,84,,
997,0.97,5276.871,5278.973,38 Webinars.,84,,
998,0.97,5278.973,5297.525,We wanted Tofrom West Bay to market Street and Ballard street.,84,,
999,0.97,5297.525,5301.863,That would be 38 minutes.,84,,
1000,0.97,5301.863,5310.271,This would give you an idea of the ultimate situation.,84,,
1001,0.97,5310.271,5310.938,"Next slide, please.",84,,
1002,0.97,5310.938,5316.244,This is just a reminder of the topics.,84,,
1003,0.97,5316.244,5330.491,This would also help with the transition.,84,,
1004,0.97,5358.953,5370.298,"You have station options, and the prospect Street area where you see that, or North at Gator street.",84,,
1005,0.97,5370.298,5383.678,"As you can see, there are various alignment configurations on eighth Avenue, the tracks, 15th Avenue, or Transitioning to 15th to the tracks area along armory way.",84,,
1006,0.97,5383.678,5388.816,Next slide.,84,,
1007,0.97,5388.816,5396.257,"Downtown, in pink, the preferred alternative on fifth and Harrison, and the other alternative is six and Mercer.",84,,
1008,0.97,5396.257,5401.963,You see station locations as well.,84,,
1009,0.97,5401.963,5404.866,All of these are tunneled stations.,84,,
1010,0.97,5404.866,5408.636,Next slide.,84,,
1011,0.97,5408.636,5409.003,Chinatown I.D.,84,,
1012,0.97,5409.003,5427.121,"Come alternatives on fourth and the vicinity of Fifth, fourth alternative and shallow, fifth deep and fifth shallow, and a fifth shallow diagonal station configuration that would have the same interest location on fifth but a slightly different configuration for getting to the station.",84,,
1013,0.97,5427.121,5430.191,"Next slide, please.",84,,
1014,0.97,5430.191,5447.241,"We have on the left, and alignment with the station adjacent to the existing station and a staggered configuration similar to the North.",84,,
1015,0.97,5447.241,5460.188,The South station often where the new and existing station would push a little bit further South towards Lander and a mixed profile alternative where the new station and Guideway would be elevated rather than at greater.,84,,
1016,0.97,5460.188,5462.857,"With these alternatives, they assume, the first three cases, Overpasses Outlander.",84,,
1017,0.97,5462.857,5466.127,"In the mixed profile, only one.",84,,
1018,0.97,5466.127,5473.1,"Next slide, please.",84,,
1019,0.97,5473.1,5485.513,"In Duwamish, three alternatives, preferred is the South crossing, immediately's--below that, a South edge crossing alignment option, similar, the process, harbour Island farther South.",84,,
1020,0.97,5485.513,5490.318,In a North crossing alternative on the North side of the existing bridge.,84,,
1021,0.97,5490.318,5494.388,"Next slide Finally, West Seattle and Delridge.",84,,
1022,0.97,5494.388,5506.767,"In the junction, elevated alternatives in pink, we also have come in Brown, tunnel 41St and 42Nd options.",84,,
1023,0.97,5506.767,5513.074,"In blue, a short tunnel 41St option and a medium tunnel 41St option.",84,,
1024,0.97,5513.074,5529.09,"To the right of this, in Delridge, we have three station locations potentially, and over, the Dakota, and on Delridge way with the alignment options going along and over or along Delridge way and Genesee.",84,,
1025,0.97,5529.09,5547.375,"Next slide that was background, information you have seen before I will switch gears and talk about information that is not in the draft but is something that we have been Cherry publicly through this comment period.",84,,
1026,0.97,5547.375,5551.879,The context is in response to this real estate and construction cost.,84,,
1027,0.97,5551.879,5563.691,"As you know, in response, the board adopted the realignment plan in August of last year, looking at the full St3 program and the full program looking at the rise in cost across the board.",84,,
1028,0.97,5563.691,5566.694,"Next slide, please.",84,,
1029,0.97,5566.694,5575.102,"As part of the realignment plan, the board identified affordable program schedule and Affordability gaps to target schedules for the entire program.",84,,
1030,0.97,5575.102,5585.613,"In the case of the West Seattle and Ballard project, an estimated level Affordability gap of $1.8 billion based on current financial projections and cost estimates.",84,,
1031,0.97,5585.613,5588.616,What that means is that the Smith Co.,84,,
1032,0.97,5588.616,5603.931,"To Ballard as a target delivery of 2037 but only Affordability delivery date of 2039, in order to meet the target delivery date of 2037, we would need to close that Affordability gap of $1.8 billion.",84,,
1033,0.97,5603.931,5611.973,"If we do not close that Affordability gap, we would not be able to meet the target date and we would be on the affordable delayed date of 2039.",84,,
1034,0.97,5611.973,5625.987,"As part of the realignment plan resolution, the board gave direction to intense pursue additional financial capacity and identify opportunities to reduce costs to try to meet the target delivery dates.",84,,
1035,0.97,5625.987,5626.42,Next slide.,84,,
1036,0.97,5626.42,5636.097,The work I will describe now I should note is an initial assessment of feasibility and potential cost savings based on limited engineering.,84,,
1037,0.97,5636.097,5645.906,"This information is not in the draft, it is information that has been developed more recently in response to board direction to look at cost savings.",84,,
1038,0.97,5645.906,5652.646,All of these ideas would require further study of the environmental experiments and other implications if they were to move forward.,84,,
1039,0.97,5652.646,5654.015,"Next slide, please.",84,,
1040,0.97,5654.015,5668.496,"There is two category, first idea is consulting cost savings potentially addressing the Affordability gap and a second category of the refinements that could potentially address other risks or opportunities.",84,,
1041,0.97,5668.496,5670.064,"Next slide, please.",84,,
1042,0.97,5670.064,5679.84,"In terms of feedback, we are going to the board and seeking direction on whether to study any of these ideas further.",84,,
1043,0.97,5679.84,5682.076,We are not seeking the board's direction to adopt these ideas now.,84,,
1044,0.97,5682.076,5693.421,"These ideas are not in the draft, they are based on limited work and would need further assessment before being adopted as part of the project and additional public feedback.",84,,
1045,0.97,5693.421,5693.888,Next slide.,84,,
1046,0.97,5693.888,5713.541,"Focusing on the first category, next slide, these are the five ideas across the core door for cost savings, number one is to shift the station which could result in a savings of $200 million.",84,,
1047,0.97,5713.541,5716.977,Item number two is to eliminate the Avalon station.,84,,
1048,0.97,5716.977,5726.32,"If you did that, and shifted the elevated station, you could achieve a cost savings of about $325 million.",84,,
1049,0.97,5726.32,5739.533,Number three is to consolidate the South Lake Union stations what could result in 570 main five dollars Cost-Saving.,84,,
1050,0.97,5739.533,5743.804,The station entrance refinements in downtown which could achieve a cost savings of 206 $5 million.,84,,
1051,0.97,5743.804,5753.914,I will explain these and details and subsequent slides number five is to ship the slightly which could result in a savings of 100 $20 million.,84,,
1052,0.97,5753.914,5761.489,Starting in the junction with the first idea of shifting the elevated station.,84,,
1053,0.97,5761.489,5786.247,"The light in red shows what is in the draft, the light in green shows the potential refinements which would shift that station and the alignment associated with it a little bit to the East, by doing so it would avoid a multi family development with 300 fewer Displacements and could result in a cost savings of about $200 million.",84,,
1054,0.97,5786.247,5786.547,Next slide.,84,,
1055,0.97,5786.547,5791.952,The second idea is eliminating the Avalon station.,84,,
1056,0.97,5791.952,5798.058,"Again, you can see the Red line showing what is in the draft.",84,,
1057,0.97,5798.058,5817.978,"This would eliminate the Avalon station and allow our lower height Guideway and Delridge station and avoids, if you combine it with the previous idea it would avoid the multi family development in the junction and have a similar overall Ridership which is shown in the purple bar chart.",84,,
1058,0.97,5817.978,5826.287,"If you did both of the ideas together, you would have a cost savings of about $325 million.",84,,
1059,0.97,5826.287,5836.63,"This shows eliminating the Avalon station with the medium tunnel 41St alternative, a tunnel alternative that has been 30 in the draft.",84,,
1060,0.97,5836.63,5850.444,If you eliminated the Avalon so soon station you can reduce property effects on Displacements and have similar overall Ridership and it could result in a cost savings of about $60 million compared to what is in the financial plan.,84,,
1061,0.97,5850.444,5850.878,Next slide.,84,,
1062,0.97,5850.878,5857.751,"In the downtown segments, the third idea is to consolidate the Denny and South Lake Union stations.",84,,
1063,0.97,5857.751,5870.164,"In red, the alternative, included in the draft which you can see, the yellow Rectangles represent the station locations at Denny and South Lake Union included in the draft.",84,,
1064,0.97,5870.164,5884.578,The green line represents the consolidated station locations that would be in the vicinity of Dexter and Denny with lower Ridership and avoid impacts to the streetcar and could connect to either the Seattle center station options.,84,,
1065,0.97,5884.578,5893.32,"On the right, it would reduce the Ridership by about 10,000.",84,,
1066,0.97,5893.32,5896.19,It would result in a cost savings of about $575 million.,84,,
1067,0.97,5896.19,5902.663,This is just a close-up of that particular station location.,84,,
1068,0.97,5902.663,5914.642,"The gray rectangle in the middle shows the platform location underneath Dexter Avenue and also shows how it can preserve North, South, East, West transit opportunities.",84,,
1069,0.97,5914.642,5914.942,Next slide.,84,,
1070,0.97,5914.942,5920.914,"The fourth idea is potential station entrance refinements, there are several.",84,,
1071,0.97,5920.914,5931.926,"The first is at the Midtown station as you can see, the idea is that we would shift the entrance from private property into the sidewalk.",84,,
1072,0.97,5931.926,5948.542,"Right now, many of our station Entrances are soon to be on private property, property in downtown, as you can imagine, very expensive and in some cases, if it is a possible to avoid that, move the Entrances into the existing public Right- Of-Way and we could yield some cost savings.",84,,
1073,0.97,5948.542,5958.719,"In this location, fourth and Madison, associated with the North Midtown station entrance, it could have a cost savings of about $20 million.",84,,
1074,0.97,5958.719,5963.424,Another station entrance refinements is in the West Lake station.,84,,
1075,0.97,5963.424,5972.199,Right now in the draft we have assumed three station Entrances to the new stations in addition to the Entrances to the existing station.,84,,
1076,0.97,5972.199,5989.183,"If we eliminated two Entrances and consolidated them into a larger single entrance, with a single head house with multiple entry points, we could eliminate some of the property acquisition costs and have a cost savings potentially of $190 million.",84,,
1077,0.97,5989.183,6003.464,"The third idea in the downtown area is in the Denny station area where, if we can avoid some property acquisition and instead move the entrance into the street, we could have a cost savings of about $55 million.",84,,
1078,0.97,6003.464,6010.104,This would require the permanent foreclosure of Lenore street to accommodate this.,84,,
1079,0.97,6010.104,6010.504,Next slide.,84,,
1080,0.97,6010.504,6020.247,"The last segment is in the Ballard section, the idea is to shift the tunnel 14th Avenue alignment.",84,,
1081,0.97,6020.247,6029.623,"Here you see, in red, the alternative alignment that is leading the draft, the tunnel alternative on 14th.",84,,
1082,0.97,6029.623,6035.095,If we shifted that out of the roadway we could result of cost savings of $140 million.,84,,
1083,0.97,6035.095,6043.637,The next slide shows that in closer detail where you can see the alternative in the middle of the public Right-Of-Way.,84,,
1084,0.97,6043.637,6053.981,"If we shifted that out of the roadway, and eliminated the station entrance on the West side of 14th, the total cost savings would be about 100 million dollars.",84,,
1085,0.97,6053.981,6061.088,Those are the cost savings ideas and we have looked at other refinements that could address other risks.,84,,
1086,0.97,6061.088,6065.759,"There are six ideas, starting on the left.",84,,
1087,0.97,6065.759,6070.831,"First, providing access North and south of Andover street.",84,,
1088,0.97,6070.831,6075.702,I will go over ideas about how to improve Andover street.,84,,
1089,0.97,6075.702,6080.774,This is another entrance refinement in the Midtown station area.,84,,
1090,0.97,6080.774,6086.48,Item C is shifting the Seattle center West.,84,,
1091,0.97,6086.48,6097.858,"Item D involves connecting the South Lake Union and Harrison alternative, the pink line, to the Seattle center at Mercer alternative, mixing and matching the two alignments in this location.",84,,
1092,0.97,6097.858,6105.933,"And shifting the tunnel portal is item E, further South to avoid impacts in that area.",84,,
1093,0.97,6105.933,6109.903,Item f is consolidating the Smith Cove and Interbay stations.,84,,
1094,0.97,6109.903,6121.081,"Starting in Delridge, I will go over these, this provides better access on the North--the South side of Andover Street associated with the Andover Street patient location.",84,,
1095,0.97,6121.081,6136.864,"A couple of ideas for doing this, one idea is to provide a pedestrian bridge across Andover Street so people do not have to cross the street in the location.",84,,
1096,0.97,6136.864,6141.735,"If we could have a pedestrian bridge at that location, it would improve the experience of getting to the station platform.",84,,
1097,0.97,6141.735,6143.737,Next slide.,84,,
1098,0.97,6143.737,6150.277,Another idea is to shift the station itself slightly to the South.,84,,
1099,0.97,6150.277,6153.213,You can see the two yellow Rectangles at the top right of the graphic.,84,,
1100,0.97,6153.213,6157.951,The new station location would overlap the existing proposed station location.,84,,
1101,0.97,6157.951,6166.994,"By doing that, it facilitates access on the South side of Andover Street and facilitates a lower height of station and Guideway.",84,,
1102,0.97,6166.994,6174.234,It would require the closure or Reroute of 32nd Avenue Southwest as noted on the bottom left of this graphic.,84,,
1103,0.97,6174.234,6174.635,Next slide.,84,,
1104,0.97,6174.635,6181.875,"In the downtown segments, the item be is a Midtown station refinement.",84,,
1105,0.97,6181.875,6189.049,"Again, this is trying to reduce property acquisition.",84,,
1106,0.97,6189.049,6192.119,"This is at the Midtown station, the South entrance at the corner of fifth and Columbia.",84,,
1107,0.97,6192.119,6208.335,"That is a complicated property acquisition and a complicated entrance to build and if we can shift it out of the private property onto the street Right- Of-Way and put the entrance in the sidewalk, it could reduce some risk.",84,,
1108,0.97,6208.335,6210.203,Item C is shifting the station to the West.,84,,
1109,0.97,6210.203,6221.348,This is associated with the preferred alternative.,84,,
1110,0.97,6221.348,6228.455,"As you can see, in green, represents the shifted station location, basically moving the station a block or two to the West to avoid concerns with the impact and the proximity to the Seattle center.",84,,
1111,0.97,6228.455,6234.161,Next slide.,84,,
1112,0.97,6234.161,6240.634,"Item D is connecting the South Lake Union station, pink South Lake Union station with the blue Mercer station location.",84,,
1113,0.97,6240.634,6248.375,"Essentially, what is represented in green is a Mix- And-Match between the alignments in the station location to address some concerns and impacts in that area.",84,,
1114,0.97,6248.375,6249.61,Next slide.,84,,
1115,0.97,6249.61,6262.189,"South Interbay, again, this idea involves looking at the tunnel portal and shifting that tunnel portal for those purposes, South.",84,,
1116,0.97,6262.189,6269.329,That portal location is currently in the draft and will be adjacent to the station on prospect street.,84,,
1117,0.97,6269.329,6274.968,We have been moving that portal a little bit further South.,84,,
1118,0.97,6274.968,6282.709,The benefit of this is it would help reduce some slope stability concerns that we had in that area.,84,,
1119,0.97,6282.709,6297.924,"You can see that this would require the station Locationhe moved north of the magnolia bridge, as represented by the green rectangle, currently the station options are to the South.",84,,
1120,0.97,6297.924,6312.739,"By shifting that tunnel portal South, you can see that it would lessen the slope--steep slope of Fax, but as represented by the yellow rectangle, it requires shifting the station further North.",84,,
1121,0.97,6312.739,6313.04,Next slide.,84,,
1122,0.97,6313.04,6317.477,The final idea is to consolidate the Smith Cove and Interbay stations.,84,,
1123,0.97,6317.477,6328.555,"You can see where the text is for Smith Cove, the currently proposed station, where it would be, to the right is the Interbay station location.",84,,
1124,0.97,6328.555,6337.23,This would be looking at consolidating both those locations into a midpoint location represented by the green line.,84,,
1125,0.97,6337.23,6343.503,"You can see the green rectangle, which would be north of the magnolia bridge, adjacent to the Seattle armory property.",84,,
1126,0.97,6343.503,6359.686,The alignment would be essentially in tunnel until you get to the green station location which would be a retained cut station and would continue and tunnel to Ballard which could connect to the 14th or 15th tunnel locations in Ballard.,84,,
1127,0.97,6359.686,6363.557,This shows more detail on that.,84,,
1128,0.97,6363.557,6369.663,The blue identifies some of the benefits or opportunities associated with this alternative.,84,,
1129,0.97,6369.663,6378.772,It would avoid impacts to the parks and green belts along that section of Elliott Avenue between hillside and avoid steep slope concerns in that area.,84,,
1130,0.97,6378.772,6387.514,It would avoid traffic effects on Elliott because we would be in tunnel until we get north of the magnolia bridge.,84,,
1131,0.97,6387.514,6393.386,There would be a minor reduction in the overall Ridership and that is represented by the green bar chart on the right which reduces overall Ridership by about 2000.,84,,
1132,0.97,6393.386,6401.528,"It does avoid a former landfill, the golf center is on the landfill, it would avoid Impacting that area.",84,,
1133,0.97,6401.528,6407.634,It also avoids railroad and Interbay properties in the vicinity of the Interbay station.,84,,
1134,0.97,6407.634,6412.506,Those properties would be complicated to acquire.,84,,
1135,0.97,6412.506,6415.342,Next slide.,84,,
1136,0.97,6415.342,6418.578,This is just a little bit of a closer look at this Consolidated patient idea.,84,,
1137,0.97,6418.578,6433.627,"As noted, it identifies potential and existing connections to Expedia, represented by the green dotted lines in this area and shows the potential connections to the Greenbrier trails.",84,,
1138,0.97,6433.627,6438.765,It would directly serve the armory site and areas that have development potential.,84,,
1139,0.97,6438.765,6443.77,It would have potential connections to the trail network and Interbay.,84,,
1140,0.97,6443.77,6456.55,It would be compatible with some of the key recommendations from the bridge studies and it connects to either of the Ballard tunnel location stations on 14th or 15th.,84,,
1141,0.97,6456.55,6460.854,That concludes my presentation.,84,,
1142,0.97,6460.854,6467.961,"Just a reminder of the process of the next few months as we will be going to the sound transit system committee extension, the date in April is not confirmed.",84,,
1143,0.97,6467.961,6479.105,We hope to go to the system expansion Committee in May and in June to request the recommendation to confirm a modified alternative and to the full board later in June.,84,,
1144,0.97,6479.105,6482.576,"Next slide, please.",84,,
1145,0.97,6482.576,6485.412,That concludes my presentation.,84,,
1146,0.97,6485.412,6485.812,Thank you.,85,,
1147,0.97,6485.812,6492.319,I think you get a record for going through a 73 slide Powerpoint very efficiently.,85,,
1148,0.97,6492.319,6503.697,"Thank you for being here, for presenting these concepts to us, relatively early, though they are new to a lot of us.",85,,
1149,0.97,6503.697,6507.767,I think I want to thank my colleagues for their patients.,85,,
1150,0.97,6507.767,6512.205,A lot have questions or comments.,85,,
1151,0.97,6512.205,6523.65,I think we will see the benefits of the city council district system of representation because nobody knows their district better than the Councilmember.,85,,
1152,0.97,6523.65,6537.597,We will have a lot of very Nuanced and thoughtful comments that impact different parts of the city.,85,,
1153,0.97,6537.597,6540.7,I NOTE you may have to get back O us with answers to so these.,85,,
1154,0.97,6540.7,6549.809,This is another reason why we have a resolution from the Council and that will be helpful and we will get to starting on May 17th.,85,,
1155,0.97,6549.809,6555.081,"For now, let's ask some questions and have comments.",85,,
1156,0.97,6555.081,6565.458,"Colleagues, anything now?",85,,
1157,0.97,6565.458,6584.744,"We will start with Councilmember Herbold . I know Councilmember Strauss has questions, I appreciate Council member Louis joining us.",85,,
1158,0.97,6584.744,6585.979,Councilmember Herbold?,85,,
1159,0.97,6585.979,6591.718,Thank you . a couple of questions and a couple of comments.,86,,
1160,0.97,6591.718,6592.686,I will start with comments.,86,,
1161,0.97,6592.686,6605.265,I just want to highlight the fact that I have heard a lot of different perspectives about the Avalon station.,86,,
1162,0.97,6605.265,6618.478,"I appreciate that some emphasize the development on and around Avalon needs--it is important to keep the station, others are okay with removing it.",86,,
1163,0.97,6618.478,6632.492,"I hear from those who are okay with removing it, some unified belief that we should only do so if it provides some benefit to the West Seattle community, such as a longer tunnel.",86,,
1164,0.97,6632.492,6650.744,"I also want to highlight that, as it relates to Accessing the line via Delridge, the high point community and others would be most likely to access the line via 35th and the Avalon station.",86,,
1165,0.97,6650.744,6666.326,"If there was a consideration to remove the Avalon station, we would need to have a clear plan for providing access from high point and the adjacent communities.",86,,
1166,0.97,6666.326,6676.636,"And, just an old point that I have made before in a letter I submitted.",86,,
1167,0.97,6676.636,6698.591,"I want to take the opportunity to state for the record that an elevated alignment through the heart of the West Seattle junction urban village and through a built neighborhood in the Youngstown area of North Delridge would be, not only unique to this line, but unprecedented for light rail in Seattle.",86,,
1168,0.97,6698.591,6704.164,That is why so many people have concerns about the proposal.,86,,
1169,0.97,6704.164,6727.587,"As far as the questions go, I did have a question about the Guideway height for the option in Dell ridge with the elevated Fauntleroy station and lower Guideway for the Delridge station.",86,,
1170,0.97,6727.587,6730.99,"I would be interested to know, at the highest point, how high the Guideway would be?",86,,
1171,0.97,6730.99,6738.498,"Also, I am trying to understand the assumptions around removing the Avalon station.",86,,
1172,0.97,6738.498,6757.15,"The presentation says that it will be the same number of riders whether there is an Avalon station or not, but says there are 1200 riders that would be using the Avalon station.",86,,
1173,0.97,6757.15,6760.854,How did you determine the number of riders?,86,,
1174,0.97,6760.854,6772.665,"There are a lot of multi family buildings on Avalon, how do you make that determination of likely Ridership?",86,,
1175,0.97,6772.665,6809.936,"We have covered this before but it would help to refresh my memory, particularly in taking about how you approach that question in light of a particular community that, even though there is the golf course, this is a very Built- up, dense part of the line and I am not sure what the assumptions are, perhaps there are assumptions that people will continue using rapid ride, but I would like to hear more about that.",86,,
1176,0.97,6809.936,6812.238,Thank you.,86,,
1177,0.97,6812.238,6812.639,Yes.,87,,
1178,0.97,6812.639,6814.841,Thank you for the comments and the questions.,87,,
1179,0.97,6814.841,6837.363,"In regards to the first question, the Guideway height, with regard to the elevated Fauntleroy alternative which assumes an alignment along Genesee through Delridge . at its highest point, which is the lowest point in Delridge as a ghost through the Longfellow Creek.",87,,
1180,0.97,6837.363,6839.866,The preferred alternative Guideway height is about 150 feet.,87,,
1181,0.97,6839.866,6841.1,Less at the station locations.,87,,
1182,0.97,6841.1,6853.079,"At its highest point, where it is crossing the lowest point in the valley, the Guideway is about 100 50 feet high, and it needs to be to get up to the height of the Avalon station.",87,,
1183,0.97,6853.079,6871.364,"If you do not have the Avalon station, you don't necessarily have to have as high of a Guideway, you can reduce that to 30 feet through the Delridge area . that would be the implication as I noted briefly in the presentation.",87,,
1184,0.97,6871.364,6880.506,"In regards to the Avalon station and removing it, and the Ridership implications, that is one of the lower Ridership stations on the line.",87,,
1185,0.97,6880.506,6889.649,It has about 1200 people riding according to our productions.,87,,
1186,0.97,6889.649,6917.043,"If we remove the Avalon station from consideration, we think the bus routes that would be integrated with the station would integrate with the Alaska junction station, have to Ridership on Avalon is bus transfers and those buses, instead of transferring--the riders, we would assume they would just transfer to the Alaska junction, or Delridge, but primarily Alaska junction.",87,,
1187,0.97,6917.043,6922.949,"That is why the Ridership does not change, the bus Ridership would be going to another station instead.",87,,
1188,0.97,6922.949,6938.464,"The other part of the equation is the Avalon station is close to the walk shade, which is similar, about a third of a mile in separation between the stations.",87,,
1189,0.97,6938.464,6945.705,That is part of the reason people would walk to the other station location instead.,87,,
1190,0.97,6945.705,6951.11,That is based on our Ridership projections.,87,,
1191,0.97,6951.11,6957.684,It is a Ridership model which looks at these considerations.,87,,
1192,0.97,6957.684,6964.157,Hopefully that helps explain a little bit about where we got to our numbers.,87,,
1193,0.97,6964.157,6966.426,Thank you.,88,,
1194,0.97,6966.426,6969.929,That will do it for now I may have follow-up questions.,89,,
1195,0.97,6969.929,6973.9,I appreciate it.,89,,
1196,0.97,6973.9,6974.2,Thank you.,89,,
1197,0.97,6974.2,6981.641,Any other questions for Seattle transit staff?,90,,
1198,0.97,6981.641,6982.141,Councilmember Strauss?,90,,
1199,0.97,6982.141,6986.112,Thank you.,91,,
1200,0.97,6986.112,6988.348,Great to see you as always.,91,,
1201,0.97,6988.348,6997.49,"I just have to, first, state my compliments to you for getting through so much detailed information so quickly.",91,,
1202,0.97,6997.49,7002.562,I have seen presentations with far less detail go much longer.,91,,
1203,0.97,7002.562,7009.469,"I just wanted to take a moment and I feel like, by the end of this process, you could write a book.",91,,
1204,0.97,7009.469,7011.704,It is a book that I would read.,91,,
1205,0.97,7011.704,7017.41,This presentation in and of itself is great.,91,,
1206,0.97,7017.41,7019.212,If you could bring up some of the slides.,91,,
1207,0.97,7019.212,7022.882,"I don't know if you were referring to slice 70, 49, 12.",91,,
1208,0.97,7022.882,7029.355,"I will start with ebony, then 49, then 12.",91,,
1209,0.97,7029.355,7046.706,"With slide, I may be speaking out of my district come out of my turn, I just want to look at this and I will end with a question.",91,,
1210,0.97,7046.706,7054.981,"Having an Inter-Base station, this consolidation, it seems like it is being placed on 15th.",91,,
1211,0.97,7054.981,7080.139,"If that is correct, I just have to raise that this ignores the community concerns about placing a station on 15th that was--all of these comments will come to you from the time we had the elected leadership group, that we had the Dias framework narrowed in so you could do this work.",91,,
1212,0.97,7080.139,7091.551,Something I have to highlight and elevate is that you were trying to do this work in advance to get consensus so that the process is more streamlined and we can deliver the project faster.,91,,
1213,0.97,7091.551,7093.352,That is something I want to help you with.,91,,
1214,0.97,7093.352,7101.294,"At this moment, this is a change from when this information was presented.",91,,
1215,0.97,7101.294,7111.571,Because there was a very strong push to say West the 15th is best and now I am concerned that this is now putting it back on 15th.,91,,
1216,0.97,7111.571,7144.136,"I know that we have had a fair amount of work with Ballard, the original corridor, and a letter presented to Psrc about getting Federal funding for the corridor, we have a very narrow right away with increased use, and I know a letter was signed to Psrc and we were successful in getting the amendment and we would love to have your participation in the Workgroup moving forward.",91,,
1217,0.97,7144.136,7155.314,I just want to highlight it feels like this is a ignoring and making assumptions about development decisions not yet made about the armory.,91,,
1218,0.97,7155.314,7173.9,"It makes assumptions about how we will be using the industrial lands, as Land-Use chair, right now, we are looking at strengthening industrial protections.",91,,
1219,0.97,7173.9,7183.743,"I think that, for you to meet your Ridership levels, we would have to do a entire change about how the industrial areas are utilized.",91,,
1220,0.97,7183.743,7197.557,"With that, my question is, because this is not specifically contained within the Deis, how to make this change without supplemental Deis?",91,,
1221,0.97,7197.557,7202.061,Thank you for the question.,92,,
1222,0.97,7202.061,7208.935,I can better explain this particular alternative that I think will address your concerns.,92,,
1223,0.97,7208.935,7216.676,"This alternative, as you noted, is adjacent to 15th, not on 15th, it would be to the West of 15th.",92,,
1224,0.97,7216.676,7221.347,I would also note that the alignment is primarily underground.,92,,
1225,0.97,7221.347,7226.419,It would not have traffic affects on 15th.,92,,
1226,0.97,7226.419,7232.491,"The alignment, if you look at the graphic here, you can see where the yellow rectangle is.",92,,
1227,0.97,7232.491,7233.926,That is where the station could potentially be.,92,,
1228,0.97,7233.926,7254.847,"It would not be within the 15th Right-Of-Way, it would be in the property to the West of that the brackets to the left--to the right, show the area where there would be a retained cut, low-grade and open to the top, with opportunities to cross over on crossings in those locations.",92,,
1229,0.97,7254.847,7263.222,"Everything to the North and south of the black brackets would be in tunnel, below grade.",92,,
1230,0.97,7263.222,7265.758,"Again, there would be no direct effects to the 15th Avenue Right-Of-Way.",92,,
1231,0.97,7265.758,7277.37,"As you noted, from phase one, the elected leadership group process and the community process director, there was concerns about impacts to traffic.",92,,
1232,0.97,7277.37,7296.088,"Again, as I noted in my slides, hopefully I noted in my slides, this alignment could connect to either the 14th or 15th tunnel locations in Ballard it could go either direction.",92,,
1233,0.97,7296.088,7297.923,That is one of the concerns.,92,,
1234,0.97,7297.923,7332.191,"In terms of the concerns about industrial lands, yes, I recognize that this is just noting the potential regarding the armory property which could serve the station location but does not assume that in the Ridership estimates, no change in land use is assumed as part of the alternative so that daily trips on the project is based on existing Land-Use assumptions, not assuming any element of the property necessarily.",92,,
1235,0.97,7332.191,7352.945,"To the last question, yes, this alternative was not looked at in phase 1, and was not looked at in the draft Deis in phase 2 . This is a new idea it is in response, or based on following the board direction to look at opportunities to find cost savings.",92,,
1236,0.97,7352.945,7362.722,"Although, in this case, not so much a cost savings that would result from this alternative, but it avoids a lot of potential risk areas as noted on this graphic.",92,,
1237,0.97,7362.722,7376.102,There were impacts to parks in the Greenbelt associated with the draft Deis alternatives that this would potentially avoid and addresses concerns about steep slopes which could have cost applications.,92,,
1238,0.97,7376.102,7385.878,It avoids traffic affects on Elliott which are noted in the draft Deis you would not have those traffic affects.,92,,
1239,0.97,7385.878,7392.251,"Furthermore, as noted on the right, it avoids concerns about the landfill and properties in this area.",92,,
1240,0.97,7392.251,7417.576,"It is very much a response to things, risks and opportunities we have identified through the draft Deis process, but it has not been studied in the draft Deis . If there was an interest in looking at this further, additional supplemental environmental work would be required I do not know the nature of that environmental work right now, whether it requires supplemental Deis or documents.",92,,
1241,0.97,7417.576,7427.486,That is something that would be a factor of whether there is interest in looking at this idea and direction from the board to do so.,92,,
1242,0.97,7427.486,7432.992,"Then, we would have to consult with our Federal partners on what the environmental process implications would be.",92,,
1243,0.97,7432.992,7450.81,"If there was additional environmental work and additional study, we would need to bring this alternative up to the level of analysis of the current draft Deis alternatives and we would need additional public feedback before we could go to the board to seek direction of whether to actually implement this alternative.",92,,
1244,0.97,7450.81,7454.113,It is a very new idea.,92,,
1245,0.97,7454.113,7462.655,A lot more work would be needed to start and we welcome your feedback on it.,92,,
1246,0.97,7462.655,7469.361,"That answer is why I love working with you so much, detailed spot on response.",93,,
1247,0.97,7469.361,7470.162,Thank you for that.,93,,
1248,0.97,7470.162,7487.98,"With the Bracketed--you answer the question about the supplemental Deis . about the 15th impact, you answer long- term questions about the Right- Of-Way, and were Spot-On that the tunnel will limit the impacts to the Right-Of-Way.",93,,
1249,0.97,7487.98,7500.426,"My concern is, did I hear you say that the Bracketed area here would be a cut and cover--or, in the street?",93,,
1250,0.97,7500.426,7505.397,"It would not be in the street, it would be on a property to the West of the right away.",94,,
1251,0.97,7505.397,7506.732,It would be a retained cut.,94,,
1252,0.97,7506.732,7530.89,"The station itself would be open to the outside, much like the Chinatown Id station and we could have roadway Overpasses to provide access to the properties to the West, there are a couple of locations right now where you can access those properties and that was to be a possibility.",94,,
1253,0.97,7530.89,7536.295,Maybe we are having a nomenclature issue.,95,,
1254,0.97,7536.295,7548.374,"Seeing the brackets starting on Interbay golf on the right, just in the letter C in consolidated Smith Cove.",95,,
1255,0.97,7548.374,7551.81,That is the area that would be open?,95,,
1256,0.97,7551.81,7553.245,Correct.,96,,
1257,0.97,7553.245,7555.681,Retained cut in that area.,96,,
1258,0.97,7555.681,7563.188,"Yes, just noting that there is not just one parcel.",97,,
1259,0.97,7563.188,7567.86,"I trust you, you are the engineer.",97,,
1260,0.97,7567.86,7573.532,"If you can get that done and it is not in the Right-Of-Way, I trust you.",97,,
1261,0.97,7573.532,7574.967,I am just raising my concerns.,97,,
1262,0.97,7574.967,7584.51,This is not even my district and I see Councilmember Lewis has his hand up.,97,,
1263,0.97,7584.51,7589.214,If we can move to slide 49.,97,,
1264,0.97,7589.214,7612.972,"I will just start with sharing with the sound transit team, directed at no one in particular, just that, because of the pedestrian safety and Connectivity to the downtown commercial and residential core, I do not see an option east of 15th as being acceptable.",97,,
1265,0.97,7612.972,7615.608,I think it is a question I need to have answered here.,97,,
1266,0.97,7615.608,7633.492,"How do we access the core of Ballard safely? I will share with you, Ballard was Annexed 125 years ago this coming may 29th and this was Ballard.",97,,
1267,0.97,7633.492,7637.963,"This right here is 15th, the edge of Ballard.",97,,
1268,0.97,7637.963,7648.307,While it has been 125 years and a lot has changed and I am sure a lot more will change between now and when the infrastructure is built.,97,,
1269,0.97,7648.307,7660.486,"I highlight the fact that, right now, the core residential area in Ballard is to the West of 15th . There is residential north of market street.",97,,
1270,0.97,7660.486,7662.554,"However, there is not residential south of market street.",97,,
1271,0.97,7662.554,7687.312,"If we are looking about moving people because that is what the sound transit is all about, I have very great concerns that, either people would have to cross market Street if--for assuredly, they would have to E cross 15th.",97,,
1272,0.97,7687.312,7706.799,"Again, we bring up the industrial conversation because, with 15th and market, they are the two borders of the industrial area, that are again, we are having the industrial conversation again, I am not seeing a proposal to change this area.",97,,
1273,0.97,7706.799,7717.142,"Yes, it could happen in the next 15, 16 years, but I see us having more needs for our industrial area and not fewer.",97,,
1274,0.97,7717.142,7737.262,"I think that your graphic really demonstrates the industrial nature of this area--when you look at Northwest 45Th street, there are two Crescent-Shaped lines on the diagram, these are former railroad lines that are either partially or not in use at this time.",97,,
1275,0.97,7737.262,7745.804,Those rail lines continued all the way to market Street and all the way up 14th because that was the former bridge street.,97,,
1276,0.97,7745.804,7752.244,I see a desire to use that Right-Of-Way.,97,,
1277,0.97,7752.244,7756.782,Now we are talking about moving even further East away from the core.,97,,
1278,0.97,7756.782,7773.899,"My questions are, how do pedestrians, Bicyclists, people with all ages and abilities, access the core of Ballard safely? Let's start and I have a couple more.",97,,
1279,0.97,7773.899,7784.409,"Yes, we could speak to this and a lot more detail and perhaps Maybe we should describe some of our station planning work in this area.",98,,
1280,0.97,7784.409,7799.224,The concern you expressed about access across 15th Avenue is a commonly expressed concern.,98,,
1281,0.97,7799.224,7814.239,"We would need to be looking at that 15th Avenue crossing in context of the 14th Avenue station alternative, we would need to look at the 15th Avenue crossing and ways to make it a safer crossing for pedestrians, if the station weren't 14th.",98,,
1282,0.97,7814.239,7822.981,"In the case, the 15th Avenue station alternative and the elevated alternatives, they do envision the entrance on the West side of 15th.",98,,
1283,0.97,7822.981,7826.985,You would not have that crossing concern with those particular alternatives.,98,,
1284,0.97,7826.985,7830.088,That is right.,99,,
1285,0.97,7830.088,7856.582,"I think that we all know that the people will use or choose not to use transit infrastructure, bicycle infrastructure, walking infrastructure, of low stress levels if they are a low stress level user, they will not use two separate pieces of low stress infrastructure if it is crossed and divided by a high stress environment.",99,,
1286,0.97,7856.582,7859.952,"That is what 15th is, that is what market Street is.",99,,
1287,0.97,7859.952,7884.142,"To be able to to have a station placement that is divided from the core of Ballard by 15th, it will not just be station area improvements are needed, it will need to be a way that everyone feels very safe about crossing the street.",99,,
1288,0.97,7884.142,7912.638,"Again, my concerns I raised in my last--in the last slide we discussed and the concern I raise here, is that 15th Avenue is the third most used North- South corridor after Sr-9 and I- 5. it is responsible for our disaster mitigation.",99,,
1289,0.97,7912.638,7927.185,I share this with you because there is a need to create the pedestrian Connectivity and ensure the goods of freight and truck movement are able to move freely through this area.,99,,
1290,0.97,7927.185,7930.622,I am getting a number of great concerns.,99,,
1291,0.97,7930.622,7951.576,"We need to be making the best policy and station decisions to serve our city, our riders, and our entire region my last question in this life, have you evaluated government owned properties in the core of Ballard for potential use?",99,,
1292,0.97,7951.576,7955.213,I cannot speak directly to that.,100,,
1293,0.97,7955.213,7980.005,"We did, as you know, as you recall, in the phase 1 of the Stakeholder advisory group process, we did look at station locations to the West of 15th, but, as part of the initial phase of project development, we did look at options to the West of 15th.",100,,
1294,0.97,7980.005,7992.784,"As you recall, a lot of the alternatives went through the screening process, that included review and recommendations by the Stakeholder advisory group and the leadership group.",100,,
1295,0.97,7992.784,7998.657,Those ideas were not carried forward.,100,,
1296,0.97,7998.657,8004.029,"Because of concerns about cost and technical feasibility, and residential affects.",100,,
1297,0.97,8004.029,8010.936,I do not know specifically which properties were affected in those configurations.,100,,
1298,0.97,8010.936,8015.774,"I would have to go back and look at the details, whether they were publicly owned properties that were affected.",100,,
1299,0.97,8015.774,8019.044,I do not know the specific answer.,100,,
1300,0.97,8019.044,8020.445,You are so good.,101,,
1301,0.97,8020.445,8022.047,I love working with you.,101,,
1302,0.97,8022.047,8025.717,Can we switch to slide 12?,101,,
1303,0.97,8025.717,8027.452,You made the transition so beautifully.,101,,
1304,0.97,8027.452,8036.461,"When I say evaluated governmental parcels, I am speaking of, how can we best leverage assistance to you?",101,,
1305,0.97,8036.461,8041.366,Not in a negative impact to government owned parcels or places.,101,,
1306,0.97,8041.366,8063.288,"How can we leverage city, County, state, I don't want to speak for the court, I will get in trouble, but how can we leverage what the greater community owns through government to benefit this 100 year infrastructure?",101,,
1307,0.97,8063.288,8081.339,"You mentioned, I will bring up again, my community gave you four options during the Elg on phase one, and I will venture to say that there was Murmurs but not strong statements about the 22nd.",101,,
1308,0.97,8081.339,8094.586,"This was presented to the elected leadership group and community members were quite loud I know this because I was staffing it, I was there, I heard both elected leaders and community advocates asking for this.",101,,
1309,0.97,8094.586,8114.506,"One of the screening criteria that it was my recollection was used, you wanted to go forward with your number options to be able to base cost and feasibility and two of those options, it is basically 15th and 14th, with elevated versus tunnel.",101,,
1310,0.97,8114.506,8127.686,"At that point, you did not know if the tunnel would be more expensive than the elevated structure we now know the elevated structure is more expensive, which is why we're only left with two options.",101,,
1311,0.97,8127.686,8146.571,"My concern is that, one of the reasons that 20th, 17th, even 22nd were screened out, was because of the cost, because the tunnel was assumed to be more expensive than the bridge.",101,,
1312,0.97,8146.571,8155.747,"Absolutely, a bridge, an aboveground structure landing in the core of Ballard would be highly disruptive and highly costly.",101,,
1313,0.97,8155.747,8174.399,"Now that I see you are leaning us towards having a tunnel in this area, in our last--the last time you came to Committee, I asked about what determines the cost of a tunnel, geology, direction?",101,,
1314,0.97,8174.399,8179.271,These are the things that have been brought up.,101,,
1315,0.97,8179.271,8204.863,"We don't need to answer it now but I raise this because we were told that we could not have--the community brought you four options and we were told two options were not going to work because of cost, because we were basing our decisions off of the bridge, the bridge is now the Premier option for us.",101,,
1316,0.97,8204.863,8233.491,"So, when we do apples to apples comparisons of Connectivity to the core of Ballard, across 15th on a surface level, as compared to the cost of turning a drill ever so slightly just a few Millimeters to hit a different angle, what is going on?",101,,
1317,0.97,8233.491,8252.177,"The question is, how are we using the baseline, or the base cost analysis, to drive our decision-making when making decisions about 100 year infrastructure and the need to connect the core residential areas to this infrastructure?",101,,
1318,0.97,8252.177,8255.714,I would offer a few thoughts.,102,,
1319,0.97,8255.714,8258.917,They would require a deeper conversation with you.,102,,
1320,0.97,8258.917,8271.496,"In terms of the alternatives that were looked at in the previous phase in 2017, the 2019 Timeframe, you are correct, we looked at options further West.",102,,
1321,0.97,8271.496,8281.84,You are correct in that the expectations about tunnel costs have changed compared to elevated costs.,102,,
1322,0.97,8281.84,8292.651,As has been noted because of increased real estate cost and construction costs and our needs we have identified as part of project development.,102,,
1323,0.97,8292.651,8298.79,It is important to note that it was not just cost that was a determining factor in screening out those alternatives further West.,102,,
1324,0.97,8298.79,8305.03,There were technical feasibility concerns in terms of getting there.,102,,
1325,0.97,8305.03,8310.335,They dealt with infrastructure that we need to avoid the Emerson interchange.,102,,
1326,0.97,8310.335,8314.339,And some other underground utilities in that area.,102,,
1327,0.97,8314.339,8323.481,"That was also a factor in assessing, or screening out, those alternatives, some of the alternatives further West.",102,,
1328,0.97,8323.481,8326.985,There were also concerns with residential affects.,102,,
1329,0.97,8326.985,8332.824,Some of the street Right-Of-Way further West is narrower and much more built up.,102,,
1330,0.97,8332.824,8341.099,"Therefore, fitting in a station within that more dense urban area would have required large residential Displacements.",102,,
1331,0.97,8341.099,8347.706,Not that that cannot be done but that was a factor in ruling out those alternatives.,102,,
1332,0.97,8347.706,8361.686,"It is true to say that the costs--to explain or other concern, it is true to say that the cost of elevated and tunnel alternatives have gotten closer in this case.",102,,
1333,0.97,8361.686,8371.663,The tunnel 14th is similar to the elevated in this area and there has been a convergence between tunnel and elevated costs.,102,,
1334,0.97,8371.663,8385.51,The relative cost of tunnels to each other would still hold and the total alternatives further West are more expensive at that time because they were longer tunnels.,102,,
1335,0.97,8385.51,8390.315,"Again, that would involve tunnel stations in more Built- up areas.",102,,
1336,0.97,8390.315,8391.983,That was part of the cost element.,102,,
1337,0.97,8391.983,8393.385,That was not the only factor.,102,,
1338,0.97,8393.385,8410.034,"As I said, technical feasibility and residential affects were important factors at that time in terms of just cost, the length of the tunnels and the location of the stations would have factored into those cost differentials as well.",102,,
1339,0.97,8410.034,8418.543,"Again, this is probably a much deeper conversation if you would like to discuss further, I would be happy to.",102,,
1340,0.97,8418.543,8421.813,That is why I'm going to read your book and why I love working with you.,103,,
1341,0.97,8421.813,8425.45,"I highlight that you say, at the time, there would be longer tunnels required.",103,,
1342,0.97,8425.45,8433.591,I know the tunnel portal was of great concern to get to 17th through 20th.,103,,
1343,0.97,8433.591,8455.914,"I just highlight slide 70 where we were talking about--you don't have to move, just when we were talking about Interbay, we were talking about moving the tunnel Portals completely, with that new information, it seems like there may be more information to be investigated in this area as well.",103,,
1344,0.97,8455.914,8459.45,That might relief the cost of longer tunnels.,103,,
1345,0.97,8459.45,8498.756,"It may also believe the technical barrier of the underground utilities, Infrastructur, and I will say this, there is no easy way of saying this, but to, on one hand, say we cannot have a station in--West of 15th because of residential displacement, and then request to build a station where there is not land use code allowing residential buildings, it gives me a lot of pause.",103,,
1346,0.97,8498.756,8501.025,It gives me a lot of concern.,103,,
1347,0.97,8501.025,8522.68,"Again, I have great concerns regarding any station placement east of 15th, I have a strong desire to deliver infrastructure consistent with what voters approved, and I appreciate you and am incredibly impressed with this presentation.",103,,
1348,0.97,8522.68,8523.748,"No further questions, chair.",103,,
1349,0.97,8523.748,8525.583,That is all I have.,103,,
1350,0.97,8525.583,8530.455,Thank you.,104,,
1351,0.97,8530.455,8530.922,Councilmember Lewis?,104,,
1352,0.97,8530.922,8541.933,"Thank you so much, Councilmember Pedersen . Thank you for inviting me so we can give direct feedback to sound transit on these alignments.",105,,
1353,0.97,8541.933,8549.974,I mostly want to make comments but I am happy to get direct feedback and clarify things.,105,,
1354,0.97,8549.974,8562.954,"I first want to start by saying that I have gotten very strong community feedback, universally, for Sib 1 alignment in South Interbay.",105,,
1355,0.97,8562.954,8581.072,"I want to go on the record and Express that that location and alignment was served the residents of South magnolia, West queen and, the needs of port of Seattle, and service the cruise ship terminal.",105,,
1356,0.97,8581.072,8598.356,It is a very big added benefit that it protects the city asset of the Greenbelt and reduces the amount of loss that alternative alignments do not accommodate and I want to express that.,105,,
1357,0.97,8598.356,8606.497,"As far as the preferred alignment, that is the stronger preference with community Stakeholders we have spoken to about it.",105,,
1358,0.97,8606.497,8614.572,"For similar reasons, there has been consternation expressed about the consolidated station in Interbay.",105,,
1359,0.97,8614.572,8634.726,"While it seems to have equal access to a lot of other assets, it seems to be far away from those assets and not necessarily be best positioned to capitalize on transportation connections, particularly for folks who are making magnolia connection commutes.",105,,
1360,0.97,8634.726,8650.942,That Consolidated station is met with a lot of opposition from Stakeholders in queen Ann and magnolia who will be Commenting on the environmental impact statement and wanted to raise up those concerns.,105,,
1361,0.97,8650.942,8669.027,There has been concerns that the rider estimate may be underestimated on disproportionately Impacting magnolia connection rides.,105,,
1362,0.97,8669.027,8675.099,That is some feedback people I have been speaking with wanted me to express.,105,,
1363,0.97,8675.099,8681.639,"I am sure we will be mentioning, in the comment period.",105,,
1364,0.97,8681.639,8692.05,"Going back to talk about the uptown alignment decisions, I do have some clarifying questions.",105,,
1365,0.97,8692.05,8725.45,"The concept about moving the station further West down Republican to the spot that I believe is currently occupied by a fast food restaurant, can you comment now, or maybe I can check in with Kexp, does that mitigate their concerns about the potential impacts to do that station movement further down Republican?",105,,
1366,0.97,8725.45,8738.362,"Or, does it only partially mitigate or not mitigate the potential impacts to the cluster and that corridor in Republican?",105,,
1367,0.97,8738.362,8756.347,"My understanding is that the Mercer Street alignment is far preferable to avoid potential impacts to have to make mitigate any relocation or long- term closure of some of the institutions like the Seattle Rep, Kexp station.",105,,
1368,0.97,8756.347,8773.164,I appreciate we did have that discussion and the city submitting questions is really looking into what that impact is and what the cost of mitigation would be before the end of the comment period.,105,,
1369,0.97,8773.164,8779.137,"But, in terms of going forward with the alignments presented, my understanding is the Mercer Street one takes care of a lot of the concerns.",105,,
1370,0.97,8779.137,8785.676,I am not up to speed on whether the--moving the station two blocks was similarly do that.,105,,
1371,0.97,8785.676,8790.481,I don't know if that is something you can share here.,105,,
1372,0.97,8790.481,8797.922,"At the very least, it is good for expanding the scope of the EIS.",105,,
1373,0.97,8797.922,8799.023,Those are my big questions.,105,,
1374,0.97,8799.023,8802.66,I really appreciate the presentation and the detailed.,105,,
1375,0.97,8802.66,8814.872,This was a fantastic committee meeting to the dive into this very complicated alignment process which has a lot of implications about the future of our community.,105,,
1376,0.97,8814.872,8831.689,"I appreciate sound transit and the city, and share Pedersen, putting together a form to air these concerns and looking forward to hopefully getting invited back again as we continue to talk about city policy that relates to these projects.",105,,

1379,0.97,8835.159,8860.151,"All Councilmembers will be invited back to the May 17th committee meeting where we will discuss potentially a draft resolution expressing our preferences and I appreciate the Councilmembers speaking up for their districts and sharing intimate knowledge they have of their districts, block by block, that has a major impact.",106,,
1380,0.97,8860.151,8879.27,I appreciate Councilmember Morales talking about the Chinatown-International district . I recently met with community leaders who were interested in the fourth Avenue shallow option to minimize impacts and understand why it would have an impact on the fourth Avenue Southbridge.,106,,
1381,0.97,8879.27,8884.742,"Although, fixing a bridge would be a good thing, potentially.",106,,
1382,0.97,8884.742,8890.014,Any other comments while we have sound transit staff here?,106,,
