103,0.97,621.687,626.092,"I can either speak to that now or hold until my report, which follows.",10,,
104,0.97,626.092,640.606,"I think it would make sense to do it all in one vein so we can keep it all together in the same, sort of, context.",11,,
105,0.97,640.606,642.408,Feel free to go ahead and address it now.,11,,
106,0.97,642.408,643.442,Thank you so much.,12,,
107,0.97,643.442,644.81,"So, let's see here.",12,,
108,0.97,644.81,667.233,We are putting on a bill Referenced by Councilmember Strauss in his remarks . Council bill 120157 which is legislation and changes to a bill that was passed in late June of this year.,12,,
109,0.97,667.233,674.273,The Mayor noted at the time that she had concerns about a probation in the bill that was added by amendment of Council.,12,,
110,0.97,674.273,677.143,The Mayor signed it.,12,,
111,0.97,677.143,681.847,Shortly after the Mayor sent the Council a brand new bill that undid the amendment the council passed.,12,,
112,0.97,681.847,697.863,I believe that this is a precedent that we should seek to avoid the change in the legislation that this legislation seeks to undo is not in effect and would not be in effect until July of next year.,12,,
113,0.97,697.863,709.608,The original legislation also requested the executive to report back on the types of projects being developed under the authority of the legislation.,12,,
114,0.97,709.608,714.98,Concerned that by voting now we are denying ourselves valuable data to understand what kind of developments are moving forward.,12,,
115,0.97,714.98,728.527,"All of that said, those are just sort of my feelings about bringing this bill back to us after the fact that we voted on it a few short months ago.",12,,
116,0.97,728.527,731.597,I am bringing forward an amendment that I hope will be seen as a compromise.,12,,
117,0.97,731.597,748.814,This amendment would allow 80% AMI rental Affordability thresholds to be used in the urban centers and villages identified in the comprehensive plan as having a high displacement risk.,12,,
118,0.97,748.814,760.626,The amendment would maintain the lower 60% AMI rental Affordability threshold in other locations throughout the city.,12,,
119,0.97,760.626,773.239,"At a 60% AMI Affordability threshold, qualifying one person would pay rent in a studio at $1162 a month.",12,,
120,0.97,773.239,784.783,A four person household would pay affordable rent in a three bedroom at $1726 a month for the 60% AMI thresholds.,12,,
121,0.97,784.783,798.13,"Rented units developed on property owned in urban centers and villages with high displacement risks by religious organizations that receive the density bonus will have a more progressive, 80% of AMI Affordability threshold.",12,,
122,0.97,798.13,816.081,That would result in rents for a studio at $1545 a month . or a three bedroom at $2295 a month.,12,,
123,0.97,816.081,840.105,"As was discussed with Council bill 120081, state law requires a minimum 80% AMI% Affordability and explicitly allows, I should say, it requires--it allows a maximum 80% AMI Affordability.",12,,
124,0.97,840.105,844.476,The state law explicitly allows legislators to consider the needs of Renters in our own cities by having lower Affordability requirements.,12,,
125,0.97,844.476,861.36,"Just like we do with Mft E, for instance, which state law authorizes certain Affordability but we are allowed as legislators to set Affordability that addresses our market needs in the city.",12,,
126,0.97,861.36,882.881,"The old bill effective date for the lower AMI Affordability threshold until next year, next July as in July 2022, that would have allowed any projects currently in the pipeline to move forward onto the state law requiring only 80% AMI Affordability.",12,,
127,0.97,882.881,907.907,"Now that we are reconsidering this issue, this alternative path I am proposing--80% AMI threshold within urban centers and urban villages identified in the conference of plan and growth equity is having higher displacement risk . This includes the central district and of the neighborhoods where historic--displaced.",12,,
128,0.97,907.907,909.341,This is a point of information.,12,,
129,0.97,909.341,926.592,We have done a little bit of analysis of the AMI for different demographic households just to give us a little bit of a grounding on this legislation.,12,,
130,0.97,926.592,939.738,According to the 2017 ACS Chz data they were 1400--320 black Renter households in Seattle.,12,,
131,0.97,939.738,960.659,"The black Renter households earning over 50% AMI but under 80% AMI, the number of those households was 1505 households that aren't over 50% but under 80% AMI . that's only 10.5% of all black Renter households.",12,,
132,0.97,960.659,997.896,"Black Renter households earning under 50% AMI represented nearly 70% of all black Renter households . You can do this analysis for other demographics, and just generally looking at Renter households generally the threshold at 80% AMI would leave a large number--leave these units out of the--out of reach for a large number of Renter households in the city.",12,,
133,0.97,997.896,1016.782,"And so, I just really wonder if we allow all religiously on properties throughout the entire city to develop at 80% AMI, we are creating a disincentive for religious institutions to partner with Nonprofits resulting in fewer rentals at the lower Affordability levels that Renters in the city really need.",12,,
134,0.97,1016.782,1020.219,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",13,,
135,0.97,1020.219,1029.795,I know that Councilmember Strauss sent me a quick message saying he would like an opportunity to respond.,13,,
136,0.97,1029.795,1031.196,I'm going to recognize Councilmember Strauss.,13,,
137,0.97,1031.196,1037.936,I do see that Councilmember Lewis has his right hand raised so I will call on Councilmember Lewis after Councilmember Strauss.,13,,
138,0.97,1037.936,1045.31,"Thank you, Council president and Councilmember Herbold.",14,,
139,0.97,1045.31,1047.246,I appreciate the spirit in which you are bringing this.,14,,
140,0.97,1047.246,1050.315,I want to reground us with the process in which we engaged this bill.,14,,
141,0.97,1050.315,1055.087,We had these amendments and Committee before it came to Full-Term.,14,,
142,0.97,1055.087,1056.155,The amendments did not pass.,14,,
143,0.97,1056.155,1063.662,We heard from community about the reasons why they did not want this amendment to pass in the first place.,14,,
144,0.97,1063.662,1065.13,When the bill came --,14,,
145,0.97,1065.13,1069.968,This is a completely different amendment.,15,,
146,0.97,1069.968,1070.903,I'm sorry.,15,,
147,0.97,1070.903,1083.649,"Councilmember Herbold, I will give you an opportunity to respond but we've if we cannot interrupt each other, that would be greatly appreciated.",16,,
148,0.97,1083.649,1084.049,My apologies.,16,,
149,0.97,1084.049,1085.384,"Go ahead, Councilmember Strauss.",16,,
150,0.97,1085.384,1091.49,"Councilmember Herbold, let me broaden the conversation to the conversation about 60% AMI versus 80% AMI.",17,,
151,0.97,1091.49,1095.994,This conversation did occur at committee.,17,,
152,0.97,1095.994,1109.208,It was ultimately not pass because of the concerns that we heard from community members and churches about the flexibility of they needing to provide services and flexibility to meet the congregation's where they are.,17,,
153,0.97,1109.208,1119.985,"Councilmember Herbold, you and I sat together next to each other at an event Saturday before the Monday vote where I did not know you were going to bring these amendments.",17,,
154,0.97,1119.985,1125.424,I could not discuss with community members the impact of the 60% versus 80% AMI requirement.,17,,
155,0.97,1125.424,1131.73,"You did brief all of us, all colleagues, at the same time I Council briefing.",17,,
156,0.97,1131.73,1141.974,The morning before that vote we and that did not allow us enough time to discuss with community members the impact and for them to be able to appropriately share.,17,,
157,0.97,1141.974,1153.919,I can say that I know there were community members who were ready to testify in support of the bill at full council but did not realize that these amendments were calming.,17,,
158,0.97,1153.919,1154.92,There's a process issue here.,17,,
159,0.97,1154.92,1160.325,This is not about the Mayor Resending another bill that will create a precedent.,17,,
160,0.97,1160.325,1167.065,This is about us working with community members to meet their needs in the best way possible.,17,,
161,0.97,1167.065,1176.909,What I've heard loud and clear is that churches need the flexibility to be able to have people up to 80% AMI in their building.,17,,
162,0.97,1176.909,1191.657,So that they can either choose to have people move back into the community that had been displaced or to use that revenue that creates the services that other residents are receiving.,17,,
163,0.97,1191.657,1199.498,"I, as a policymaker, I'm not here to tell churches how they need to meet the congregation's needs and housing needs in the community.",17,,
164,0.97,1199.498,1208.307,I am here to support them with legislation that gives them more flexibility to do so.,17,,
165,0.97,1208.307,1230.696,"So, again, I appreciate the spirit in which you are bringing today's amendments, which is similar and different, as you noted, where you are now focusing be 60% AMI only outside of urban villages . I, unfortunately, cannot support this amendment today because as many of us know these are lines on a map.",17,,
166,0.97,1230.696,1236.535,"They are, for better or worse, Magi boundaries that we as policymakers have created.",17,,
167,0.97,1236.535,1237.135,Look at density.,17,,
168,0.97,1237.135,1243.842,Not necessarily how we are supporting churches bringing the housing needs to the community.,17,,
169,0.97,1243.842,1261.86,"When I've reached out to committee members about this, you have rightly focused in the central district . However, there are still churches that we need to allow them to have a flexibility to meet their congregation's needs, housing needs not within urban centers and urban villages.",17,,
170,0.97,1261.86,1266.231,"So, I have reached out to community members.",17,,
171,0.97,1266.231,1285.684,"They lets me know that this is still problematic and that--and because the community who we spoke to in Committee who then, you know, had opposition after we passed the final bill with the 60% AMI amendment have now said to me the same things about today's amendment.",17,,
172,0.97,1285.684,1294.993,"Top line . I absolutely appreciate you being a problem Solver, Councilmember Herbold's.",17,,
173,0.97,1294.993,1298.497,I appreciate the spirit in which were bringing this but unfortunately I cannot support the amendment today.,17,,
174,0.97,1298.497,1299.831,"Thank you, Councilmember Strauss.",18,,
175,0.97,1299.831,1318.183,"Councilmember Herbold, you wanted to add some meat to the conversations I'm going to go ahead and recognize you and then if I can sort of create space for Councilmember Lewis to Chime in as well after that that would be fantastic.",18,,
176,0.97,1318.183,1331.697,I appreciate the main point I wanted to make was that this is a different amendment than the amendment that came up at full council in a previous meeting.,19,,
177,0.97,1331.697,1346.244,I hope everybody recognizes the disadvantage we are at under the new rules of the city council where we cannot actually attend a committee meeting and vote on amendments.,19,,
178,0.97,1346.244,1360.992,The amendment in question from last June was amendment that was an amendment to that Councilmember Peterson had brought forward at that feeling committee.,19,,
179,0.97,1360.992,1369.768,"That I brought forward and full Council, which is I think, I hope, my right to do so.",19,,
180,0.97,1369.768,1375.073,As a Councilmember who is not a member of the committee where the amendment is being discussed and voted on.,19,,
181,0.97,1375.073,1402.3,"It would have been great if this bill had gone back to Committee and given--folks had been given another opportunity to discuss the bill again . Now that we are, you know, be required to vote on legislation that we just voted on, and just--I think it's important to realize that, yes, we are here to address the needs of community.",19,,
182,0.97,1402.3,1426.291,"That means making sure that we are building affordable housing that meets the needs of community . In this case, the religious facilities are seeking to, particularly religious facilities that are located in areas of high displacement, are seeking to--to receive a return on their investment.",19,,
183,0.97,1426.291,1434.199,Sufficient so they can maintain their institutions within these areas . This amendment allows those churches to do so.,19,,
184,0.97,1434.199,1454.119,"We also have a responsibility as policy owners not only to make sure that developers are building housing that meets the needs of our Renter communities, but we are also, in this case, we have an obligation to make sure that there is a public benefit.",19,,
185,0.97,1454.119,1458.156,We are basically doubling the development capacity of these parcels.,19,,
186,0.97,1458.156,1471.57,"And so, as policymakers, we have the right and obligation to define a public benefit and in exchange for increasing the profitability of development on these parcels of property.",19,,
187,0.97,1471.57,1472.37,Thank you.,19,,
188,0.97,1472.37,1475.04,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",20,,
189,0.97,1475.04,1482.681,I am going to be interested in making some comments on the process generally.,20,,
190,0.97,1482.681,1492.49,"Before we Volleyed back to Councilmember Strauss, Councilmember Lewis has been patient with his hand raised.",20,,
191,0.97,1492.49,1495.76,"If you don't mind, I would like to recognize Councilmember Lewis and hear from him.",20,,
192,0.97,1495.76,1498.196,Thank you.,21,,
193,0.97,1498.196,1503.268,I am going to do a topic change here.,21,,
194,0.97,1503.268,1512.811,You had something you wanted to weigh in on on the current discussion.,21,,
195,0.97,1512.811,1515.113,-- a different topic there's another item from Councilmember Trauss committee.,21,,
196,0.97,1515.113,1516.681,Thank you for the clarification.,22,,
197,0.97,1516.681,1522.787,Lets me go ahead and see if I can close the Loop and we will call on you.,22,,
198,0.97,1522.787,1535.333,"On some of these process issues, I think this amendment is a rather significant change from anything that was discussed in committee or previously debated and considered in full council.",22,,
199,0.97,1535.333,1546.378,I personally have not seen the language yet for this proposed amendment and perhaps I missed it in my Inbox . My staff tell me they also have not seen this proposed amendment.,22,,
200,0.97,1546.378,1572.47,I don't have any--the benefit of any analysis from our Council central staff or from my own staff or from Department staff to give me a sense of what the impact of the proposed amendment by Councilmember Herbold would be . I am concerned about that particular aspect of it.,22,,
201,0.97,1572.47,1609.708,"Of course, we recognize that not all Councilmembers sit on all committees because of how we have had to modify our Council rules . I will note, however, in other instances, we have had the opportunity to Institute the model of an author versus a sponsor that would allow a Councilmember who does not sit on a committee, nor has the right to vote in a committee still has an opportunity to identify a Councilmember within the respective committee and be recognized as an author of said amendment.",22,,
202,0.97,1609.708,1622.721,And they do have the opportunity to join the committee meeting and make arguments in favor of or against particular amendments regardless of whether or not they have the right to vote.,22,,
203,0.97,1622.721,1636.134,I did want to clarify that for the record since they were comments being made about inability to lift policy issues at committees by virtue of not being a member of that committee.,22,,
204,0.97,1636.134,1644.943,We did create an opportunity for folks to overcome that barrier through this author versus sponsor distinction.,22,,
205,0.97,1644.943,1649.047,I do want to just clarify that for the record.,22,,
206,0.97,1649.047,1677.542,"Again, I think it will be important for us to, you know, continue to have this conversation, but I'm a little worried about the hefty nature of this amendment and not having most of us have the benefit of analysis . again, either from Council central staff or the Department staff or, in my case, my own staff.",22,,
207,0.97,1677.542,1683.248,"Let's go ahead and, I see a couple of hands raised.",22,,
208,0.97,1683.248,1689.287,I see Councilmember Strauss and Councilmember Sawant.,22,,
209,0.97,1689.287,1691.756,"Councilmember Mosqueda, it is on the subject as well causes better yes.",22,,
210,0.97,1691.756,1692.157,Okay.,23,,
211,0.97,1692.157,1706.104,Let's go ahead and hear from Councilmember Strauss then Councilmember Sawant and hopefully we will be to wrap up this confirmation conversation so that Councilmember Lewis can get onto a different topic.,23,,
212,0.97,1706.104,1732.797,"I just wanted to respond to Councilmember Herbold that saying yes, I mean, the ideal is that we have the housing--affordable housing and 60% AMI across the city and in so many ways we have so many policies and funding mechanisms to do so through office of housing and our housing investments . This is a bit separate from that where we need to give community members the flexibility they need to meet their own needs.",24,,
213,0.97,1732.797,1747.011,"Yes, this is absolutely an exception from the rule of how we should not typically bring back legislation that has been previously voted on and considered.",24,,
214,0.97,1747.011,1758.923,The reason that I am supporting this and that I made the request to do this is because of the level of impact to the community and the ability for us to make that right by our community.,24,,
215,0.97,1758.923,1762.56,"Thank you, Councilmember Strauss.",25,,
216,0.97,1762.56,1768.566,"Just to clarify, I am seeing that Councilmember Herbold did send out the amendment.",25,,
217,0.97,1768.566,1771.569,"It did, however, go out yesterday at 7:35 PM.",25,,
218,0.97,1771.569,1775.373,"Unfortunately, I am just now seeing it.",25,,
219,0.97,1775.373,1784.749,"And trying to catch up here like him for many, many others are . Councilmember Sawant, go ahead.",25,,
220,0.97,1784.749,1797.195,"I just wanted to comment on the process, not so much on the amendment.",26,,
221,0.97,1797.195,1803.701,I'm a little bit Disconcerted by what I see as really inconsistent positions.,26,,
222,0.97,1803.701,1812.911,"[Indiscernible] is saying this is last minute and yes the amendment should come and Sunday, yesterday evening.",26,,
223,0.97,1812.911,1819.317,Councilmember Strauss sent to dress in the middle of the Council meeting last week.,26,,
224,0.97,1819.317,1824.422,"In other words, we all sometimes are forced to catch up to things because things happen.",26,,
225,0.97,1824.422,1827.625,Sometimes at a very fast pace.,26,,
226,0.97,1827.625,1831.93,I think we should all bring amendments in advance.,26,,
227,0.97,1831.93,1834.732,My office certainly tries extremely hard to do that so that everybody has time.,26,,
228,0.97,1834.732,1856.554,"On the other hand, we all have been in a situation where we have brought amendment at the last second and I think ultimately what matters is the substance of the amendment as a benefit . The vast majority of vendors who are exploited and in this case the issue has been framed as affordable housing to help people return to [Indiscernible] marginalized communities.",26,,
229,0.97,1856.554,1860.758,I think that that's where the discussion should be.,26,,
230,0.97,1860.758,1862.16,Not so much on the process.,26,,
231,0.97,1862.16,1868.066,Clearly there are inconsistencies on what [Indiscernible] are upholding is the process.,26,,
232,0.97,1868.066,1868.933,Thank you.,26,,
233,0.97,1868.933,1873.338,"Thank you, Councilmember Sawant.",27,,
234,0.97,1873.338,1887.385,Any other questions or comments on Council bill 120157 including the amendment identified by Councilmember Herbold before we switch gears.,27,,
235,0.97,1887.385,1895.093,Thank you very much.,28,,
236,0.97,1895.093,1907.472,I know this is our process to normally sort of air what we are thinking that in the amendments especially in advance I want to follow that process and I'm happy to Chime in this afternoon.,28,,
237,0.97,1907.472,1914.379,I wanted to go back to the comment that Councilmember Strauss made of the importance of this legislation already including public benefit.,28,,
238,0.97,1914.379,1919.284,"Really, I am very supportive of this legislation as it is coming back down again.",28,,
239,0.97,1919.284,1931.229,"I see the ability to create affordable housing without public subsidies, which we can do better at 80% AMI.",28,,
240,0.97,1931.229,1932.43,That is a huge public benefit.,28,,
241,0.97,1932.43,1934.699,There's also greater density we are providing with this legislation.,28,,
242,0.97,1934.699,1937.201,The ability to build and build within a city is a public benefit.,28,,
243,0.97,1937.201,1947.712,I think that if we are creating Bifurcated systems where rules are different outside urban villages doubles down on the equities that we already have been seeing.,28,,
244,0.97,1947.712,1954.419,And deepen bypass public policies.,28,,
245,0.97,1954.419,1957.455,I really am supportive of the legislation as it has come in front of us.,28,,
246,0.97,1957.455,1964.162,"This legislation detected all the public benefits available at 80% AMI, and I'm excited to see this legislation in front of us this afternoon.",28,,
247,0.97,1964.162,1972.704,I think that it's important to take this opportunity to restore [Indiscernible] legislation that ensures this is workable for these religious organizations and communities.,28,,
248,0.97,1972.704,1975.94,The outcome is building affordable housing.,28,,
249,0.97,1975.94,1996.694,"And that we are doing it in a way that couples the ability to merge various funding sources and not have to have those entities rely just on public funding streams, which we can do better at 80% AMI which will be a Win-Win for both creating affordable housing and [inaudible] displacement.",28,,
250,0.97,1996.694,2005.136,I wanted to weigh in and thank you for this opportunity for the conversation today but wanted to let you know I will be supporting that bill in the legislation.,28,,
251,0.97,2005.136,2006.637,Thank you so much.,29,,
252,0.97,2006.637,2008.406,"Okay, Councilmember Herbold.",29,,
253,0.97,2008.406,2017.181,I was going to let this go but I've heard it twice so I just need to clarify.,30,,
254,0.97,2017.181,2030.528,The amendment does not permit the 80% AMI for Labilit threshold just inside of urban villages and urban centers.,30,,
255,0.97,2030.528,2037.935,It specifically is targeting those urban villages and urban centers that have been identified in the COMP plan as having a high displacement risk.,30,,
256,0.97,2037.935,2079.577,"At of recognition that in some ways the goal of the advocates is both to provide affordable housing at this 80% AMI, which is basically markets rates but also so that they can get a return on their investment sufficient so that they cannot be displaced so the amendment is focused not allowing 80% AMI and all urban centers and urban villages but specifically urban centers is an urban villages that have high just as the risk.",30,,
257,0.97,2079.577,2089.687,Because the analysis and the COMP plan for high displacement risk isn't just focused on Renters who are being pushed out of these neighborhoods because of how Unaffordable they have become.,30,,
258,0.97,2089.687,2095.293,But also on cultural institutions like religious institutions.,30,,
259,0.97,2095.293,2106.804,"So, that's the--I just wanted to clarify because it made it sound as if the amendment allowed 80% and all urban villages . Thank you.",30,,
260,0.97,2106.804,2109.607,Councilmember Strauss.,31,,
261,0.97,2109.607,2119.45,"Thank you . Councilmember Herbold, I deeply appreciate the spirit in which you bring this.",32,,
262,0.97,2119.45,2127.925,"I will highlight that my concern was that we are drawing imaginary boundaries in areas that have high displacement, high risk, and that's why the urban villages and sectors is inconsistent with my policy goal this time.",32,,
263,0.97,2127.925,2138.436,"Thank you, Councilmember Strauss.",33,,
264,0.97,2138.436,2138.736,Okay.,33,,
265,0.97,2138.736,2141.239,I think we have come to a conclusion on this particular conversation.,33,,
266,0.97,2141.239,2146.644,I am going to go ahead and Recognizecouncilmember Lewis for his question or comments on other aspects of your report.,33,,
267,0.97,2146.644,2152.65,"Thank you, Madam President.",34,,
268,0.97,2152.65,2157.922,This discussion feels Anticlimactic now but I'm going to go ahead and queued up.,34,,
269,0.97,2157.922,2199.397,I am going to be bringing in amendment today for Council bill 120153 . I believe this amendment has been circulated to all offices . It came out of public comment from a community member during the initial hearing on this topic last week and took a little Back-And- forth with the relevant departments to sort of determine how this could be incorporated into the bill anyway that met this community desire but also met the [Indiscernible] the Department was trying to create.,34,,
270,0.97,2199.397,2202.199,The bill is where the amendment is supported by Sdci.,34,,
271,0.97,2202.199,2204.969,They have given the green light.,34,,
272,0.97,2204.969,2217.014,The bill would restore some of the underlying requirements for Belltown Dmr zoning . It would reduce the width 290 feet.,34,,
273,0.97,2217.014,2222.92,This is on a small lot development bill and bill town.,34,,
274,0.97,2222.92,2225.189,It would reduce the width from 90 feet to hundred feet.,34,,
275,0.97,2225.189,2241.239,It would put that in a 22 foot setback to allow for more lighting and air on the green streets that are going to come in and around the small Outbuildings that are going to be developed on these Belltown parcels.,34,,
276,0.97,2241.239,2260.958,This is an amendment that was brought by some constituents in Belltown that just want to make sure that these new small Outbuildings that are coming in our building in an urban environment that is still emphasizing a livable Belltown without undermining the increased density and better building standards that these buildings will be held to benefit from to add more residents to Belltown.,34,,
277,0.97,2260.958,2272.937,"Like I said earlier, it is supported by the Department and it should be a fairly Uncontroversial amendment this afternoon.",34,,
278,0.97,2272.937,2282.88,I'm happy to make myself available between briefing and this afternoon to discuss it further and appreciate the opportunity to flag that in our Council briefing.,34,,
279,0.97,2282.88,2302.767,I would also say that this amendment was developed in consultation with the Strauss office and I want to thank them for available resources to go back and forth and make sure this isn't keeping with the spirit of the underlying legislation.,35,,
280,0.97,2302.767,2304.135,"Thank you, Councilmember Lewis.",36,,
281,0.97,2304.135,2307.371,Councilmember Strauss per the,36,,
282,0.97,2307.371,2317.815,"Councilmember Lewis, thank you for the reason that this is an Anticlimactic briefing is because we were able to work together throughout last week on this amendment.",37,,
283,0.97,2317.815,2328.492,"I know that I had still some concerns Friday evening, I believe [Indiscernible] working with your office making sure those concerns have been alleviated and really appreciate your collaboration on this.",37,,
284,0.97,2328.492,2333.03,Great . Okay.,38,,
285,0.97,2333.03,2334.031,"Well, thank you for that.",38,,
286,0.97,2334.031,2338.102,Any other comments or questions on Councilmember Strauss's report?,38,,

289,0.97,2348.045,2350.247,Looks like no one else has any hands raised.,38,,
290,0.97,2350.247,2354.452,"I'm going to go back to you, Councilmember Strauss so you can give Councilmember Juarez's report.",38,,
