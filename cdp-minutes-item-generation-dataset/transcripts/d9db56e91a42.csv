28,0.97,97.13,102.135,Hearing no objection.,16,,
29,0.97,102.135,102.902,The agenda is adopted.,16,,
30,0.97,102.902,103.269,Chair's report.,16,,
31,0.97,103.269,104.871,To make a couple of comments at the top.,16,,
32,0.97,104.871,108.808,There are two things that are on our agenda today.,16,,
33,0.97,108.808,130.33,"One of those things is going to be an initial hearing on the bill that I introduced and put forward a few weeks ago on permanent support of housing and that is Council bill 119975, and there is not going to be a vote or consideration of amendments.",16,,
34,0.97,130.33,145.512,"This is the first hearing on the bill for central staff to answer questions, to hear from Stakeholders and to give the public a general overview of what the bill seeks to accomplish and how that came to fruition.",16,,
35,0.97,145.512,194.16,"The second item on the agenda will be a presentation from folks on the executive side of the city government, as well as some of our outreach partners from reach and the public defender Association to discuss how investments are being stood up, that this Council funded in the budget, and how we are going to start making more progress on implementing those budget adds and turning them into reality over the course of 2021 and to give the Council a quick overview of where we stand on that and open the door to more updates as we get into January of 2021.",16,,
36,0.97,194.16,198.998,"So given that, I want to move onto the public comment.",16,,
37,0.97,198.998,203.636,At this time we will move into the remote public comment period.,16,,
38,0.97,203.636,210.543,I thank everyone for the ongoing patience and cooperation as we continue to operate this remote public system.,16,,
39,0.97,210.543,215.915,It remains the strong intent of the city Council to have public comment regularly included on meeting Agendas.,16,,
40,0.97,215.915,232.198,"However, the city council reserves the right to end or eliminate these public comment periods at any point if we deem that this system is being abused or is unsuitable for allowing our meetings to be conducted efficiently and in a manner in which we are able to conduct our necessary business.",16,,
41,0.97,232.198,235.435,I will moderate the public comment period in the following manner.,16,,
42,0.97,235.435,242.875,"First, the public comment period for this meeting is up to 20 minutes and each Speaker will be given two minutes to speak.",16,,

46,0.97,263.963,279.212,"Once I call a Speaker's name, staff will Unmute the appropriate microphone and an automatic prompt that you have been Unmuted will be the Speaker's Cue that it is their turn to speak and that the Speaker must press Star six to begin speaking.",16,,
47,0.97,279.212,283.483,Please begin speaking by stating your name and the item that you are addressing.,16,,
48,0.97,283.483,288.454,"As a reminder, public comment should relate to an item on today's agenda.",16,,
49,0.97,288.454,291.09,Speakers will hear a Chime when ten seconds are left of the allocated time.,16,,
50,0.97,291.09,294.927,"Once you hear the Chime, we ask that you begin to wrap up your public comment.",16,,
51,0.97,294.927,303.803,"If speakers do not end their comments at the end of the allotted time provided, the Speaker's microphone will be muted to allow us to call on the next Speaker.",16,,
52,0.97,303.803,315.882,"Once you have completed your public comment, we ask that you please Disconnect from the line and if you plan to continue following this meeting, please do so via Seattle channel or the listening options listed on the agenda.",16,,
53,0.97,315.882,325.591,The public comment period is now open and we will begin with the first two speakers on the list.,16,,
54,0.97,325.591,328.061,Let me call the first speakers out.,16,,
55,0.97,328.061,342.675,"The first Speaker will be David Hanes, followed by Naomi C.",16,,
56,0.97,342.675,350.717,Please remember to press Star six after you hear the prompt to Unmute and then Unmute it.,16,,
57,0.97,350.717,361.294,"I turned the--Mr. Hanes, are you with us?",16,,
58,0.97,361.294,362.729,"Well, maybe we lost Mr. Hanes.",16,,
59,0.97,362.729,364.397,So why don't we move on to --,16,,

72,0.97,382.648,388.321,I tried 211 and there's nothing suitable for me to get off the street and add here to the doctor's orders.,24,,
73,0.97,388.321,399.532,I asked social worker at hospital for a motel voucher and she says I'm better off staying on the front porch in upper Queen Anne where I'm at now.,24,,
74,0.97,399.532,409.108,"My ankle is swollen and I can't take the MRI because it's constantly irritated from moving around, not able to elevate and ice and eat proper foods.",24,,
75,0.97,409.108,425.858,"I am asking city Council to reclaim the $26.5 million that was specifically sent to solve the homeless crisis right now and help people like me get off the street into a room share with first month, last month and deposit.",24,,
76,0.97,425.858,430.763,I can take over the payments but I can't--I don't have the lump sum to move in.,24,,
77,0.97,430.763,438.638,We need the homeless crisis money sent from the Federal Government to be used now as they were intended.,24,,
78,0.97,438.638,443.776,We can demand governor deploy National Guard to rapidly build tiny villages now.,24,,
79,0.97,443.776,452.985,We don't need to wait on Sharon Lee of Lehigh and urban rest stop who is closed on weekends in balcony land.,24,,
80,0.97,452.985,474.574,We don't need to buy off a political re-election support next year at expense of innocent homeless suffering a six-year crisis furthered by redirecting money meant to solve the homeless crisis into political donors and owners of government contracts in a trade of integrity and forthright effort.,24,,
81,0.97,474.574,485.084,"Please redirect the $26.5 million meant to solve the homeless crisis right now, today.",24,,
82,0.97,485.084,485.918,My phone number is 206-712- 9621.,24,,

90,0.97,519.552,527.56,"And Hattie, you have two minutes.",25,,
91,0.97,527.56,528.16,Hello.,26,,
92,0.97,528.16,530.429,My name is Hattie Rhodes.,26,,
93,0.97,530.429,534.4,I am the site coordinator for the Georgetown tiny House village.,26,,
94,0.97,534.4,540.539,I am on the phone today to advocate for a safe parking lot for Rv campers.,26,,
95,0.97,540.539,546.212,Last week I watched Rvs being towed into a small area across the street from the tiny House village here.,26,,
96,0.97,546.212,549.982,We have not been told anything about this by the city.,26,,
97,0.97,549.982,557.49,"Though, we found out later this move had been planned since August.",26,,
98,0.97,557.49,565.164,"This site has 12 Rvs, two trailers and many cars and it is located in an area that isn't suited for parking long term.",26,,
99,0.97,565.164,570.136,"If the city knew these Rvs needed to move, why didn't they find somewhere that is on asphalt?",26,,
100,0.97,570.136,571.504,Why didn't they talk to the neighbors?,26,,
101,0.97,571.504,574.573,They could have found a better solution.,26,,
102,0.97,574.573,580.479,And I am hoping that the city becomes more forward thinking in the future.,26,,
103,0.97,580.479,592.425,A safe parking lot with Port-A- Potties and purple bags is a starting point and I hope we can help the Rv campers with a longer-term solution than what they have right now.,26,,
104,0.97,592.425,593.192,Thank you.,26,,
105,0.97,593.192,596.495,"Thank you, Hattie.",27,,
106,0.97,596.495,609.709,"Our next Speaker is Harold O'Odham, although, I don't believe Harold is currently present, followed by Sean Paul who signed up but is also not present.",27,,
107,0.97,609.709,615.014,"At this time, since we--Oh, it looks like Naomi C is now present.",27,,
108,0.97,615.014,623.356,So we can go back to Naomi and you are recognized for two minutes.,27,,
109,0.97,623.356,623.623,Hello.,28,,
110,0.97,623.623,626.092,Can you hear me?,28,,
111,0.97,626.092,626.359,Yes.,29,,
112,0.97,626.359,626.826,"Oh, great.",30,,
113,0.97,626.826,627.026,Okay.,30,,
114,0.97,627.026,628.394,"Well, thanks for coming back to me.",30,,
115,0.97,628.394,629.562,I was having some problems.,30,,
116,0.97,629.562,639.005,"But I would just like to speak, my name is Naomi C with the low income housing Institute and I first want to speak on Council bill 119975.",30,,
117,0.97,639.005,647.546,"We are in full support of this bill and are so, so excited that this legislation is being brought forward.",30,,
118,0.97,647.546,654.086,"As you know, one thing barrier to creating affordable housing is the extensive land use process.",30,,
119,0.97,654.086,669.135,"And while for profit developers can absorb the cost of delayed construction starts and increase Kuntz Pfizer, Nonprofits are forced to--delay their delivery of desperately needed units.",30,,
120,0.97,669.135,682.782,"Design review can introduce uncertainty into the project schedule, delay our tax credit allocations, and Additionally, affordable housing developers are already held extremely accountable on a variety of levels to deliver high-quality buildings.",30,,
121,0.97,682.782,685.951,So thank you for bringing this forward and we look forward to seeing this implemented.,30,,
122,0.97,685.951,693.259,And then I also wanted to echo Hattie's comments on the Rv safe spot.,30,,
123,0.97,693.259,702.935,We have been in touch with the Georgetown community who has expressed over many years their frustration with this.,30,,
124,0.97,702.935,705.604,It's Disrespectful to the people living in Rvs.,30,,
125,0.97,705.604,722.488,"The Georgetown community, and the residents of the tiny House village, to create the scenario where there's tension among service providers and people experiencing homelessness instead of coming up with a solution that is really meaningful and can make a difference, which is an Rv safe lot.",30,,
126,0.97,722.488,743.476,"There are parking lots that are owned throughout Sodo and Georgetown and other places in the city by the city and by for profit owners that would be readily available to use for these safe lots, working with the Council and the community on coming up with a solution for the Rvs.",30,,
127,0.97,743.476,744.143,So thank you.,30,,
128,0.97,744.143,745.711,Thank you for calling in.,31,,
129,0.97,745.711,760.192,"So with that, we don' have any other speakers who are present, so at this time I am going to close the public comment window.",31,,
130,0.97,760.192,784.216,"If we couldn't get to you or for whatever reason you couldn't log in today, folks are encouraged to submit public comment via Email at Council at Seattle.Gov and that comment will be forwarded on to the rest of the members of the committee and myself and I apologize if we weren't able to get to you today.",31,,
131,0.97,784.216,786.986,Moving onto our items of business.,31,,
132,0.97,786.986,794.426,"So item 1, we will now move onto the presentation on Council bill 119975.",31,,
133,0.97,794.426,802.168,"So Mr. Thorpe, will you please read item 1 into the record.",31,,
134,0.97,802.168,816.448,"Discussion on Council bill 119975, permanent supportive housing land use code regulations, presentation of housing, Eric Bellgard of Seattle Club and Freeman of Seattle central staff.",32,,
135,0.97,816.448,816.916,Thank you.,33,,
136,0.97,816.916,830.162,"I also see that Jeff Simms, Tracy Ratzliff and Brian good knight have joined us as well from Council central staff for this discussion and are available to be a resource to us.",33,,
137,0.97,830.162,842.441,"Before we begin our presentations, can we do a quick round of introductions by stating your name and the organization you are here representing today?",33,,
138,0.97,842.441,846.178,"And why don't we start with--in the order that you put them out there, Jacob.",33,,
139,0.97,846.178,852.017,"Why don't we start with Tim, then Derek and then Keetle.",33,,
140,0.97,852.017,861.961,"Good afternoon, I'm Tim Parham, the director of real estate at Plymouth housing.",34,,
141,0.97,861.961,864.096,"Hello, everybody.",35,,
142,0.97,864.096,867.8,"Derek Bellgard, deputy director for chief Seattle club.",35,,
143,0.97,867.8,870.769,"I'm Keadle Freeman, council central staff.",36,,
144,0.97,870.769,879.278,"Jeff Simms, council central staff.",37,,
145,0.97,879.278,880.779,"Stacy Ratzliff, council central staff.",38,,
146,0.97,880.779,882.214,Council central staff.,39,,
147,0.97,882.214,883.249,Excellent.,40,,
148,0.97,883.249,903.269,"So why don't we move on, then, to the discussion and I'm happy that we are all here today to have a big conversation about this before we go on Recess so folks can think about this and can--over the Recess as we take this up in more detail in January.",40,,
149,0.97,903.269,907.606,But what I'm really hoping to get out of today's hearing is twofold.,40,,
150,0.97,907.606,934.533,"First, for central staff to walk through the technical elements of what this legislation will do and all of the different components and parts to it and answer questions that myself and my colleagues might have about how those elements work and some perspective areas colleagues might be thinking about for potential amendment or flagging for potential concern or support.",40,,
151,0.97,934.533,945.577,And then also hear from some of our community partners who helped my office and central staff draft this legislation about how this is going to really work in practice.,40,,
152,0.97,945.577,963.929,For folks who are building and operating permanent supportive housing and why these changes that were brought up in a process that was led and facilitated by community and community organizing are going to help us achieve our long- term goal on Scaling that permanent supportive housing.,40,,
153,0.97,963.929,977.476,"With that, I want to start with the technical elements and Keetle Freeman from central staff has been the key person on preparing and drafting this legislation and shepherding it through the process so far.",40,,
154,0.97,977.476,996.995,"When we transition out of that, Jeff has some context setting information generally about the nature of permanent supportive housing, the current supply in King County and what we need to do as a region to scale up to meet the demand and I think that will be a good Segue into hearing from our community partners.",40,,
155,0.97,996.995,1000.132,So why don't we start off by hearing from Keetle.,40,,
156,0.97,1000.132,1022.154,"I think we should also take the advantage after Keetle's presentation to have a round of technical questions, and then when we transition to the next phase, hold our questions until after we have heard from Jeff and our community partners for some of the more policy and Implementation-Based discussion.",40,,
157,0.97,1022.154,1028.627,"So Keetle, why don't we start with you and then following your presentation, I will pause for some questions from colleagues.",40,,
158,0.97,1028.627,1029.728,Sure.,41,,
159,0.97,1029.728,1032.398,Happy to do it.,41,,
160,0.97,1032.398,1033.465,"Keetle Freeman, council central staff.",41,,
161,0.97,1033.465,1036.702,Attached to the agenda are a couple of memos from central staff.,41,,
162,0.97,1036.702,1052.217,One from me that describes the particulars of Council bill 119975 and another from Jeff that put some numbers around the demand for permanent supportive housing.,41,,
163,0.97,1052.217,1075.374,"A little bit about some legislative history that informs some content in the bill and the Council's considering to take it up, what Council bill 119975 would do and then remind the committee about the procedural posture of the bill.",41,,
164,0.97,1075.374,1083.982,I don't know if I should share the memo in the interest of having something on the screen that is not my face.,41,,
165,0.97,1083.982,1094.46,I'll share the screen here.,41,,
166,0.97,1104.87,1117.082,"A definition in the growth management act which is the broad framework for regulating land use and regulating planning and land use in the state of Washington, including a definition for permanent supportive housing.",42,,
167,0.97,1117.082,1120.152,That bill was not just about permanent supportive housing.,42,,
168,0.97,1120.152,1146.979,"It was also about other changes to the growth management act to encourage provision of housing more broadly, including all forms of low income housing but among other things, council bill 1923 precluded jurisdictions planning under the growth management act from prohibiting citing of permanent supportive housing in multifamily and Multi-Use zones.",42,,
169,0.97,1146.979,1156.688,It doesn't have specific regulations that governor development of permanent supportive housing.,42,,
170,0.97,1156.688,1160.659,What would Council bill 119975 do?,42,,
171,0.97,1160.659,1176.241,"It would define permanent supportive housing for the purposes of use code, eliminate standards that can be barriers to supportive house and--weigh certain--administrative decision.",42,,
172,0.97,1176.241,1181.213,"With respect to definition, I'm here on the second page of the memorandum.",42,,
173,0.97,1181.213,1201.9,The definition for permanent supportive housing proposed by Council bill 119975 would define permanent supportive housing as a multifamily residential use with at least 90% of units affordable to households with incomes that do not exceed 50% of--income but that receives public funding and has a contractual term of Affordability for at least 40 years.,42,,
174,0.97,1201.9,1218.65,"I'll note that the office of housing has suggested some revisions to this definition that would narrow the definition in some senses to include a minimum percentage of units affordable at 30%, a very medium income.",42,,
175,0.97,1218.65,1232.13,"The definition also contemplates the provision of on-site supportive services which is a key element of permanent supportive housing and those supportive services could be available to clients and residents of the building or to clients, more properly.",42,,
176,0.97,1232.13,1260.058,"The bill would also eliminate some development standards that can be--those include exempting floor area ratio for the supportive services, from floor area ratio maximums, exempting permanent supportive housing from required street level uses where street level uses requirements are in place and also exempting permanent supportive housing from short and long-term parking requirements.",42,,
177,0.97,1260.058,1284.182,"Locations for Permanet Aden the supportive housing can be located, specifically in our commercial two zones which are the city's most auto oriented commercial zones, affordable housing for multifamily housing generally is typically authorized as an administrative conditional use and this bill would allow permanent supportive housing as a use permit.",42,,
178,0.97,1284.182,1313.111,Finally the bill would authorize the Stci director to waive certain developments for certain supportive housing as an administrative decision so projects would be exempt from design review but could still receive some of the design review type benefits by meeting a test in the bill which is the certain development standards can be waived if it leads to provision of more permanent supportive housing units.,42,,
179,0.97,1313.111,1315.747,That's what Council bill 911975 would do.,42,,
180,0.97,1315.747,1324.089,"Just a reminder about the procedural posture here, as the committee knows, any changes to the land use code come with a fair amount of procedural friction.",42,,
181,0.97,1324.089,1335.2,"This bill is subject to review pursuant to the state of our middle policy act, Stci published a threshold determination about significance meaning--is not required for this piece of legislation.",42,,
182,0.97,1335.2,1338.303,That decision is an Appealable decision and comes with a comment period.,42,,
183,0.97,1338.303,1343.008,The comment period for this bill would end on December 24th.,42,,
184,0.97,1343.008,1352.15,The appeal period will end on December 31st and Council will hold a public hearing on the bill in January.,42,,
185,0.97,1352.15,1357.489,"So that's what I have--and if you all have any questions about technical aspects of the bill, I'm happy to answer them.",42,,
186,0.97,1357.489,1366.264,"I have one at the top, Ketil, I'm happy to open it up for technical questions.",43,,
187,0.97,1366.264,1384.349,I wonder if you could say more about the conversation with office of housing around how the AMI goal post might be able to be adjusted while still keeping this a workable bill that will have the intended effect.,43,,
188,0.97,1384.349,1410.275,"I remember part of our process in drafting and going back and forth with office of housing, it was originally--you know, I did want it to be set at 30%, you know, 90% of units, 30% or below, but that had certain issues Impacting sources of funds, access to lending and other problems that nonprofit developers encounter.",43,,
189,0.97,1410.275,1421.319,It sounds like there might be a way around that to have a mixed formula that does include an explicit 30% AMI level in that formula.,43,,
190,0.97,1421.319,1424.656,I wonder if you might be able to talk a little bit about that.,43,,
191,0.97,1424.656,1428.794,And then I will open it up to more questions from colleagues.,43,,
192,0.97,1428.794,1430.962,"Sure, Yeah.",44,,
193,0.97,1430.962,1431.963,Happy to do it.,44,,
194,0.97,1431.963,1445.544,"So the definition in the bill as introduced would require that 90% of units be affordable to households with incomes that are defined the land use code as very low income, that means 50% of variable income or less.",44,,
195,0.97,1445.544,1461.593,"The population must likely to be served by permanent supportive housing would qualify at a much lower income threshold, the one that's often used for the purposes of pursuing Federal--housing tax credits is 30% AMI.",44,,
196,0.97,1461.593,1473.738,"So it's likely that most of the projects that are developed under these code revisions, if they are, passed by the Council would be projects that serve populations of 30% of AMI and below.",44,,
197,0.97,1473.738,1486.685,The Office of housing sometimes likes to include a mix of units and permanent supportive housing because it may make projects more attractive to tax credit investors.,44,,
198,0.97,1486.685,1497.195,And they recommended requiring that at least half of the units be affordable at 30% AMI and below with the rest affordable up to 50% of very medium income.,44,,
199,0.97,1497.195,1512.844,They think that's the right unit mix for attracting taxpayer investment for permanent supportive housing.,44,,
200,0.97,1512.844,1524.656,"Revised formula that would be 50%, 30% AMI and lower and then the rest would retain the same language as between 30 and--30 and 50% for the other half?",45,,
201,0.97,1524.656,1525.49,Is that --,45,,
202,0.97,1525.49,1525.757,Yes.,46,,
203,0.97,1525.757,1527.158,That's my understanding.,46,,
204,0.97,1527.158,1562.694,"I would say at least 50% is likely that there would be more than 50% but it sort of depends on who the respondents are to the city's--one thing to keep in mind is this is a land use code definition for permanent supportive housing so this is a definition not that the office of housing will use in making no funding decisions, this is a definition that a land use planner or a zoning plans Examiner at Stci will use to determine whether or not a project can avail itself of the administrative decision process and other exemptions that are proposed by this bill.",46,,
205,0.97,1562.694,1589.421,But to get it closer to what the office of housing expects when it comes to awarding funds for permanent supportive housing the mix would be at least 50% at 30% of AMI and the rest up to at least--I should say at least half at 30% of AMI with the rest affordable to households earning up to 50% of median income.,46,,
206,0.97,1589.421,1590.021,Thank you.,47,,
207,0.97,1590.021,1590.488,I appreciate that.,47,,
208,0.97,1590.488,1603.702,"I want to signal my interest right now in pursuing that amendment as recommended by the office of housing, just for central staff to be aware of that, even though we are still a little while off from this.",47,,
209,0.97,1603.702,1607.672,So that's certainly a post Recess project.,47,,
210,0.97,1607.672,1610.208,Don't strain yourself putting that amendment together right now.,47,,
211,0.97,1610.208,1610.909,But I want to flag that.,47,,
212,0.97,1610.909,1630.195,"With that, I want to open it up, council colleagues, technical questions for Ketil before we move on to the rest of the panel panel.",47,,
213,0.97,1630.195,1630.762,Yes.,48,,
214,0.97,1630.762,1631.262,Councilmember Morales.,48,,
215,0.97,1631.262,1632.43,"Thank you, Ketil.",49,,
216,0.97,1632.43,1632.831,This is helpful.,49,,
217,0.97,1632.831,1644.843,My first question was also going to be about trying to reduce the AMI limits so I'm interested in continuing to have that conversation as well.,49,,
218,0.97,1644.843,1656.287,"I wonder if you could a little further down the list, it talks about CCI's ability to waive or modify specified development standards with a couple of exceptions there.",49,,
219,0.97,1656.287,1666.698,"I wonder if you could give some examples of what that might be, if it's not related to high bulk or scale.",49,,
220,0.97,1666.698,1679.911,And then my other question is if ther's any more information about what the community relations plan that developers are required to submit might include.,49,,
221,0.97,1679.911,1680.178,Sure.,50,,
222,0.97,1680.178,1697.328,Maybe I can share another screen here to sort of show what the development standards that could be waived or modified are proposed to be.,50,,
223,0.97,1697.328,1700.231,Apologies here if I'm I'm not doing quite right.,50,,
224,0.97,1700.231,1707.539,Are you all seeing the bill language itself on the screen?,50,,
225,0.97,1707.539,1710.742,Not yet.,51,,
226,0.97,1710.742,1715.947,That don't necessarily pertain--a lot have to do with architectural detail.,52,,
227,0.97,1715.947,1730.628,"So overhead weather protection requirements, facade openings, articulation modulation, depending on the zone, there may be requirements--there may be development standards intended to break up the mass of the building so those development standards could be waived.",52,,
228,0.97,1730.628,1737.469,"Common recreational area, depending on the zone, there may be a requirement that there be community rooms or outdoor or indoor Amenity areas.",52,,
229,0.97,1737.469,1741.206,Those requirements could be waived or modified.,52,,
230,0.97,1741.206,1750.248,And then there are some--also depending on--there are some other standards like transparency standards.,52,,
231,0.97,1750.248,1756.187,So--often a requirement there be some level of transparency at the street level.,52,,
232,0.97,1756.187,1758.957,Those types of dwellings standards can be waived as well.,52,,
233,0.97,1758.957,1770.335,"There's also a blanket permission from the director to identify other similar standards, there could be Waivable if they don't affect the size of the building envelope.",52,,
234,0.97,1770.335,1779.144,"The community relations plan requirement, this is a requirement that goes along with any receipt of city funding through the--process.",52,,
235,0.97,1779.144,1786.851,I'm happy to forward you what the office of housing requires of those applicants.,52,,
236,0.97,1786.851,1804.169,But generally there has to be an early engagement component where the recipient and local funds goes up and talks with near neighbors of a project and Úother Stakeholders about the type of development that they are proposing to build and the Timeline to be constructed.,52,,
237,0.97,1804.169,1815.98,There's a requirement now that a draft plan be submitted to Oh and so that similar requirement is echoed here in the proposed regulations.,52,,
238,0.97,1815.98,1819.551,Just to jump in for a second.,53,,
239,0.97,1819.551,1822.353,"I'm sorry, Councilmember, do you have a follow-up?",53,,
240,0.97,1822.353,1822.921,"Thank you, Ketil.",54,,
241,0.97,1822.921,1865.997,"Going back to the previous question, I guess what I'm trying to understand is how, if there's an interest in waiving something, Culinary, for example, and there might be--I'm not an expert in this so--but I'll call it a therapeutic reason why a common area might be appropriate or any of these things might be appropriate for the--providing the kind of support services that the people who live there might need, how does that intersect, you know, waiving something that the folks who are living there might actually benefit from having?",54,,
242,0.97,1865.997,1866.264,Yeah.,55,,
243,0.97,1866.264,1884.048,"And so that's--there is--one thing that the code prescribes a sort of minimum standards and those minimum standards through the design review process, for example, can be waived based on a criteria that the project is somehow--has a better design as a result of those waivers.",55,,
244,0.97,1884.048,1894.592,Here the waivers would be based on determination by the Stci director that more units can be provided by waiving those standards.,55,,
245,0.97,1894.592,1898.096,So there would presumably be some kind of a Trade-Off.,55,,
246,0.97,1898.096,1910.842,"I think that sort of the concern that you're highlighting is one that would be addressed not through a land use code regulation, but through competition among Psh Roviders for city funding.",55,,
247,0.97,1910.842,1926.524,"So if there's a Psh provider who wants to receive some city funding and intends to serve a population that would benefit from having some outdoor space, they may not be as successful an applicant for those funds if they are not going to provide that space.",55,,
248,0.97,1926.524,1926.991,Okay.,56,,
249,0.97,1926.991,1927.292,Thank you.,56,,
250,0.97,1927.292,1955.92,"And Ketil, I wonder too on the discussion about the community plans and I know Councilmember Pedersen has questions, I'll get to him in just a second, but I just wonder since we do have two providers here, I know we are sort of hearing from them out of order but if Tim or Derek might want to jump in and maybe provide an illustrative example of that community plan process, this might be an appropriate time to do that, even though you're not kind of on the panel yet.",57,,
251,0.97,1955.92,1971.736,"But I don't know if either one of you want to take that on and maybe discuss what that looks like in practice, just to, you know, put some meat onto--by giving an example instead of just having the technical explanation.",57,,
252,0.97,1971.736,1977.241,I'll go first.,58,,
253,0.97,1977.241,1977.508,Great.,59,,
254,0.97,1977.508,1987.085,"Councilwoman Morales that was what I was thinking about was being talked about, the arm that waiver could possible do.",60,,
255,0.97,1987.085,2001.466,"That community space, that common area, outdoor space is all important, crucially important to our model and our model of healing the community, bringing back the sense of belonging, the family thing we are trying to create.",60,,
256,0.97,2001.466,2010.308,We know that is really vital in that healing process of this period of mental health and their physical being.,60,,
257,0.97,2010.308,2029.427,"And in any project we are going to do, it's going to be really important for us to actually make sure we have activity space to bring people together, to break bread, to actually have events, have ceremony, outdoor space, so we connect people with nature again, the best we can.",60,,
258,0.97,2029.427,2031.295,Obviously at Pioneer square we don't have that option.,60,,
259,0.97,2031.295,2035.133,But we need to get our people back out and Retouch with nature again.,60,,
260,0.97,2035.133,2037.135,That's healing as well.,60,,
261,0.97,2037.135,2056.921,"So both of those things are very important to us and I would hate for that to actually, you know, make it so--where we are pushed out or something, but I do understand the importance of trying to get as--squeeze as many units out when we have such a shortage of units.",60,,
262,0.97,2056.921,2061.626,I appreciate you speaking to that half of Councilmember Morales' question.,61,,
263,0.97,2061.626,2086.717,"I wonder if you could also maybe provide an example of the community planning process that chief Seattle pub engages in as well, the other question that was asked and Ketil provided the example of, the requirement that office of housing has to receive the public money and maybe an example of what that process is like.",61,,
264,0.97,2086.717,2089.053,Kind of broke up there.,62,,
265,0.97,2089.053,2092.69,I have an unstable connection.,62,,
266,0.97,2092.69,2095.126,"But I think--Yeah, I'm not really sure.",62,,
267,0.97,2095.126,2095.827,I'm sorry about that one.,62,,
268,0.97,2095.827,2098.196,I can't really speak to that.,62,,
269,0.97,2098.196,2098.93,"No, no problem.",63,,
270,0.97,2098.93,2100.932,"Tim, could you maybe jump in on this too?",63,,
271,0.97,2100.932,2101.499,Yeah.,64,,
272,0.97,2101.499,2106.003,Before we move on?,65,,
273,0.97,2106.003,2106.37,Thank you.,66,,
274,0.97,2106.37,2107.038,Yeah.,67,,
275,0.97,2107.038,2134.265,"Community relations plan is something that's long been required by office of housing for any applicant, so we would--I can't remember the exact timing but we mail hard copy letters to people within 500 feet and then we need to designate point people throughout the process, both in the development phase, construction and then ongoing to be a point of contact for the community.",67,,
276,0.97,2134.265,2142.607,"But I have to say many, especially Psh providers go above and beyond.",67,,
277,0.97,2142.607,2152.383,"Perceived communities have concerns throughout our projects or questions and we have to be out there investing those front, head on and that wouldn't change with this legislation.",67,,
278,0.97,2152.383,2157.388,It's always been a practice that's enforced by our--at the office of housing.,67,,
279,0.97,2157.388,2159.19,We are happy to discuss that more.,67,,
280,0.97,2159.19,2163.06,If I can just address the community space as well real quick.,67,,
281,0.97,2163.06,2171.002,It's a good point and I think this legislation doesn't preclude that.,67,,
282,0.97,2171.002,2173.671,A provider being robust community space indoors and outdoors.,67,,
283,0.97,2173.671,2193.758,"I think at Plymouth and perhaps some other providers have found that the city has requirements for the outdoor space in particular, can make it difficult to achieve the outdoor space and keep tenants and staff safe.",67,,
284,0.97,2193.758,2218.583,"And that's a lot of--you know, how we are going to keep something safe and like many of the things in this legislation we are missing out on housing units by some of these requirements so I'm in support of allowing for more for flexibility here with the providers.",67,,
285,0.97,2218.583,2218.95,Thank you.,68,,
286,0.97,2218.95,2223.421,"So with that, Councilmember Pedersen, you have been patiently waiting.",68,,
287,0.97,2223.421,2225.423,You have a question.,68,,
288,0.97,2225.423,2226.958,"Thank you, chair Lewis.",69,,
289,0.97,2226.958,2231.062,Thanks to our guests for being here with us today.,69,,
290,0.97,2231.062,2236.3,"Appreciate it, for your wisdom on these issues.",69,,
291,0.97,2236.3,2252.149,And my question is about--the thrust of my question is trying to--the Nonprofits that we work with do an excellent job with design and construction and operation of low-income housing and extremely Low- income housing.,69,,
292,0.97,2252.149,2309.974,"There are for profit developers who also try to work in this space and what I'm concerned about is, if somebody is going in at the beginning saying they are going to do permanent supportive housing but then they, for whatever reason they don't get the extra financing they need to support those services or they switch to a different model of low-income housing, which is not providing the supportive services but then they got through on the lower threshold design review, the administrative design review, I know there's a regulatory agreement, but I'm certain in reading the legislation how we would ensure that somebody saying that they are going to do permanent supportive housing, they get the exemption to not do the full design review and then a year later they go back to lower services or not providing those supportive services anymore for whatever reason.",69,,
293,0.97,2309.974,2315.446,How do we ensure that there wasn't a bait and switch?,69,,
294,0.97,2315.446,2318.182,I can answer part of that question.,70,,
295,0.97,2318.182,2326.757,I'm going to turn to my colleague Tracy to see if she has any understanding of what Maybe the office of housing would do.,70,,
296,0.97,2326.757,2344.442,"From a land use regulatory standpoint, it's probably not likely that the Seattle Department of construction and inspection would require that applicant to go back and go through design review or something else like that or go through some entitlement process for a building that has already been built.",70,,
297,0.97,2344.442,2361.792,"It may be the case that if they are not living up to the regulatory agreement, there may be some potential for there to be a civil action to enforce that agreement under some land use code or provision related to enforcing the land use code.",70,,
298,0.97,2361.792,2373.003,But I suspect that the remedy would come from whatever is contained in the regulatory agreement and how those are enforced.,70,,
299,0.97,2373.003,2377.641,"Tracy, what are your thoughts on that?",71,,
300,0.97,2377.641,2385.382,"So Councilmembers, it's hard for me to imagine there would be a for profit developer who would want to act like they are going to do a permanent supportive housing project.",72,,
301,0.97,2385.382,2393.524,I think there might be already existing types of projects that they can do that would be similar to it that may have some regulatory requirements related to it.,72,,
302,0.97,2393.524,2408.773,"I'm thinking of small efficiency dwelling units but it's quite a task to put together a permanent supportive housing project and as some of the current providers have indicated, there's a community relations process that they would have to be going through to notify the community.",72,,
303,0.97,2408.773,2424.922,"The city, obviously, is looking at that, particularly if they were to come in looking for funding and again, that activity takes place well before they come in to get funding because we require that and it's actually acquired--required underneath our housing funding policies that Council has adopted.",72,,
304,0.97,2424.922,2445.409,"It's hard for me to imagine that there will be a for profit developer who would go through the guise, I guess, of looking like they are going to develop the Psh when they had no intention of doing so and there are a limited number of even Nonprofits who are in the Psh world just because of the requirements related to doing that type of housing.",72,,
305,0.97,2445.409,2466.163,"If I may follow up with that, just looking at the legislation and maybe I'm not reading the right section, but looking at page 20 where it talks about the definition of permanent supportive housing, it just says that receives public funding or an allocation of Federal low-income housing tax credit.",73,,
306,0.97,2466.163,2468.766,What is locking them in?,73,,
307,0.97,2468.766,2475.239,I don't see what's locking them into doing the permanent supportive housing.,73,,
308,0.97,2475.239,2475.673,That's my concern.,73,,
309,0.97,2475.673,2494.024,"I support the--I support the intent of this legislation and happy to see, we want to see more permanent supportive housing built and we want to see things streamlined for those types of projects, which are the most important projects we can build for the greatest need.",73,,
310,0.97,2494.024,2511.108,I'm concerned that the way it's written currently in this draft somebody could come in and try to build something and then they lose their funding or they switch their plans after they have already skipped the design review process.,73,,
311,0.97,2511.108,2518.749,So another component to the definition is that they are Ubject to a regulatory agreement as well so several components to the definition.,74,,
312,0.97,2518.749,2534.164,"The level of Affordability and the number of units that are affordable, the fact that the funding is coming from the public and then also that there's regulatory agreement with a minimum period of time, 40 years.",74,,
313,0.97,2534.164,2541.338,"Ketil, if I may, it says that receives public funding or an allocation of Federal Low- income housing tax credit.",75,,
314,0.97,2541.338,2543.207,They don't have to receive public.,75,,
315,0.97,2543.207,2545.809,"They can just get tax credits, right?",75,,
316,0.97,2545.809,2548.445,And they have to be subject to regulatory agreement.,76,,
317,0.97,2548.445,2548.746,Uh-huh.,77,,
318,0.97,2548.746,2555.619,But we don't have the former regulatory agreement attached to this legislation at this time.,78,,
319,0.97,2555.619,2556.12,Is that right?,78,,
320,0.97,2556.12,2557.855,The form of regulatory agreement?,79,,
321,0.97,2557.855,2559.323,We don't know what it's going to say yet.,80,,
322,0.97,2559.323,2563.093,It would be the standard regulatory agreement that I--I'm not sure.,81,,
323,0.97,2563.093,2570.301,There may be different kinds but every recipient of the city funding has a regulatory agreement.,81,,
324,0.97,2570.301,2571.302,"Tracy, maybe you could speak to --",81,,
325,0.97,2571.302,2572.369,"Yeah, that's correct.",82,,
326,0.97,2572.369,2602.132,"Maybe that's a solution, is to say that it has to be a recipient of city funding, because the office of housing does a great job with their regulatory agreements for that Seattle housing levee fund but the way this is written it says public funding or low-income housing tax credit so it doesn't directly tie it down to the office of housing standard regulatory agreement which is excellent.",83,,
327,0.97,2602.132,2602.399,Yeah.,84,,
328,0.97,2602.399,2614.645,"Tracy, I don't know if you know off the top of your head, but are there any permanent supportive housing projects that only receive Federal Low- income housing tax credits as their financing mechanism?",84,,
329,0.97,2614.645,2630.961,"Not right now but I would eight to for stall the possibility for the--that actually might become a source down the road of being capital, providing some capital for Psh that might replace the city's funding, for example.",85,,
330,0.97,2630.961,2636.667,"You know, typically I would say, no, the city is in all of the Pshs being built in the city.",85,,
331,0.97,2636.667,2645.976,I can't think of one project in 15 or 20 years where the city hasn't been involved in that project and for the most part have also gotten the tax credit.,85,,
332,0.97,2645.976,2656.653,"But with this, you know, slight change in the funding environment, does it necessarily mean that every project would have to have city funding plus a tax credit?",85,,
333,0.97,2656.653,2656.987,Possibly not.,85,,
334,0.97,2656.987,2666.23,"So I would--it would be worth talking to housing to see if they agree with me about that, not wanting to Foreclose that possibility to make that an and versus an or.",85,,
335,0.97,2666.23,2676.206,"But I would want to check with them about that because of this most recent change, that may have a Subset of Psh that could be funded with tax Driest and the county but not necessarily the city.",85,,
336,0.97,2676.206,2679.877,At least on the capital side.,85,,
337,0.97,2679.877,2683.881,We will see on the operating side as well.,85,,
338,0.97,2683.881,2684.214,Thank you.,86,,
339,0.97,2684.214,2690.354,"And chair Lewis, just one more question.",86,,
340,0.97,2690.354,2709.74,"I really appreciate Councilmember Morales' question which talked about the amenities and that design review, especially when focused on the amenities portion can actually benefit the low-income housing--or the low-income tenants.",86,,
341,0.97,2709.74,2718.248,"So speaking of amenities, is there--we have passed an Internet for all resolution to try to increase access to the Internet.",86,,
342,0.97,2718.248,2724.955,Is there a way to ensure projects like this have Internet connections?,86,,
343,0.97,2724.955,2729.393,So I understand that H.U.D.,87,,
344,0.97,2729.393,2732.429,Has recently put forward minimum standards for Connectivity.,87,,
345,0.97,2732.429,2741.405,"I think that if the city were to have similar requirements for projects that receive city funding, probably the best vehicle for that would not be a land use code requirement.",87,,
346,0.97,2741.405,2746.043,It would probably be something in our housing funding policies.,87,,
347,0.97,2746.043,2748.479,And those reside in a couple of places.,87,,
348,0.97,2748.479,2757.054,There's the administration and finance plan for the housing levy which Governors levy dollars and those are not the only source of funding for affordable housing in the city.,87,,
349,0.97,2757.054,2769.366,"And we have another plan, I think it's called the housing policies documents, that's periodically amended that has other standards that apply to projects that receive city funding.",87,,
350,0.97,2769.366,2774.037,So probably an amendment to that policy document would be the appropriate place for such a requirement.,87,,
351,0.97,2774.037,2788.185,"And those will be coming to Council for Readoption in 2021 there, the a and f plan has to be adopted every two years so we will be looking at making some changes to the Enf plan policies in 2021.",88,,
352,0.97,2788.185,2808.372,And I also have got the office of housing beginning to collect information at your office's request to find out what is the current practice for nonprofit providers in terms of providing Internet access to the residents of their buildings and so hopefully we will have some data to help frame that conversation that might come up in 2021 on this issue.,88,,
353,0.97,2808.372,2810.14,Thank you.,89,,
354,0.97,2810.14,2826.223,"The only reason I ask--well, another reason is because if a developer is not getting office of housing Fund, then they might--it wouldn't be subject to that, that plan you're talking about, I don't think.",89,,
355,0.97,2826.223,2828.292,So--but we will keep talking about this issue.,89,,
356,0.97,2828.292,2837.1,"We are always looking for opportunities to increase Internet access, so thank you.",89,,
357,0.97,2837.1,2840.304,"Thank you so much, Councilmember Pedersen.",90,,
358,0.97,2840.304,2840.804,Councilmember Herbold.,90,,
359,0.97,2840.804,2841.171,Thank you.,91,,
360,0.97,2841.171,2841.672,Just a clarification.,91,,
361,0.97,2841.672,2847.544,I heard a couple of things--or I thought I heard a couple of things that are contradictory.,91,,
362,0.97,2847.544,2856.787,"This proposed legislation, as I understand it, would exempt permanent supportive housing from all design review, correct, including no administrative design review?",91,,
363,0.97,2856.787,2857.254,That is correct.,92,,
364,0.97,2857.254,2872.069,"I thought I had heard something that suggested that these properties would still be subject to administrative design review, which I think many of them already are only subject to administrative design review.",93,,
365,0.97,2872.069,2874.004,"That's correct, Yeah.",94,,
366,0.97,2874.004,2874.771,So yes.,94,,
367,0.97,2874.771,2892.589,"As it stands now, because of the ongoing Covid civil emergency, affordable housing projects are subject to design review at all but that is a temporary provision that will expire I think within a month or two after the Covid civil emergency ending.",94,,
368,0.97,2892.589,2908.438,"Which brings us back to kind of the old normal and under the old normal, affordable housing projects are subject to administrative design review only.",94,,
369,0.97,2908.438,2915.145,And do we have--it may have been included in the staff memo and I apologize if I did not see that.,95,,
370,0.97,2915.145,2927.124,Is there information that gives us some data around how many permanent supportive housing projects have gone through administrative design review over the last few years and how long that usually takes?,95,,
371,0.97,2927.124,2934.064,"There is not--we can get that information for you, but that information is not in the --",96,,
372,0.97,2934.064,2934.531,Thank you.,97,,
373,0.97,2934.531,2955.452,"I would love to get a sense of what the impacts are as it relates to saving time associated with no design review at all, including no administrative design review and that would be very, very helpful.",97,,
374,0.97,2955.452,2960.424,"Yeah, and I think due to Covid in some respects we may have better information there.",98,,
375,0.97,2960.424,2976.84,"We know how long we have information about generally how long it takes for projects to get through administrative design review, but we now have a suite of projects that are being--a suite of affordable housing projects that are being entitled under these current regulations.",98,,
376,0.97,2976.84,2981.311,Comparison of administrative design review to the Covid projects that are no design review at all.,99,,
377,0.97,2981.311,2981.745,"Correct, Yeah.",100,,
378,0.97,2981.745,2987.818,Thank you.,101,,
379,0.97,2987.818,2990.554,That would be great.,101,,
380,0.97,2990.554,2992.022,"Thank you, Councilmember Herbold.",102,,
381,0.97,2992.022,2993.69,Are there any other technical questions at this phase?,102,,
382,0.97,2993.69,3006.57,I might ask one more before we broaden is out to the rest of our panelists . Okay.,102,,
383,0.97,3006.57,3030.761,"The last question I want to ask, Ketil, no one asked this yet but I do think it's important to start the conversation about the bike storage requirements and this is something I want to flag for Derek and Tim also when we move on and talk more about site specific needs and the impact some of these regulations have had on them as providers.",102,,
384,0.97,3030.761,3050.747,"But I wonder if you might give an overview of the current nature of those regulations and what the impact would be of the ordinance, if it went through on those.",102,,
385,0.97,3050.747,3051.014,Sure.,103,,
386,0.97,3051.014,3063.16,"So currently multifamily structures are required to have one long-term bicycle parking space per unit and one Short- term space between units, and short-term spaces are intended for visitors.",103,,
387,0.97,3063.16,3066.329,"One thing to keep in mind, they don't necessarily have to be provided in the project.",103,,
388,0.97,3066.329,3069.866,They can also be provided outside of the project.,103,,
389,0.97,3069.866,3087.951,"But there is--there are existing regulations, the opportunity for the Stci director to modify those requirements based on the populations being served in the building.",103,,
390,0.97,3087.951,3094.925,So and there's--I'm not great here with zoom stuff so I'm not sure if you're seeing the screen that I'm looking at or not.,103,,
391,0.97,3094.925,3103.834,"I'm not seeing the presentation screen that is on the Seattle channel so if you are not seeing these particular regulations in front of you, maybe I will read them just in case.",103,,
392,0.97,3103.834,3119.015,"So for each yelling unit and income restricted unit at 30% of median income and below, which is likely the population that would be served, there is no minimum required long-term bicycle parking so that's existing regulations.",103,,
393,0.97,3119.015,3127.858,"Each dwelling income restricted at 61% to 31% of median income, long-term bicycle parking requirements can be wholly or partially waived by the Stci director.",103,,
394,0.97,3127.858,3133.396,That's the current state of regulations.,103,,
395,0.97,3133.396,3149.513,"The proposed bill would eliminate permanent--the requirement of long and Short- term bicycle parking for permanent--for those units that were provided between 31 and 50% of AMI, there would not be any bicycle parking requirement.",103,,
396,0.97,3149.513,3158.388,That's not to say the Department supportive housing developer might choose to provide bicycle parking but there would not be a regulatory requirement that would compel them to.,103,,
397,0.97,3158.388,3181.478,"So it would afford more flexibility to the builder and I think now we are getting into a point where these are more questions for Tim and Derek about how this might influence plans to create permanent supportive housing, maximize units, but still accomplish those goals around providing sufficient bike storage.",104,,
398,0.97,3181.478,3186.883,So maybe it would be best to transition on to them and have that discussion in more detail.,104,,
399,0.97,3186.883,3195.358,I did just want to have a little bit more of a preview of what that particular element is that haven't been asked as a question.,104,,
400,0.97,3195.358,3220.917,I think it's a good transition to transition this conversation over to talking with Tim and Derek a bit more about permanent supportive housing and the way this bill and perhaps some other things that aren't in it yet could help to facilitate the creation of more permanent supportive you housing and more units per project.,104,,
401,0.97,3220.917,3238.635,"First I want to go to Jeff and have Jeff maybe give a brief overview, kind of about where we are and where we need to go with permanent responsive housing.",104,,
402,0.97,3238.635,3251.381,He generated a memo earlier this week talking about some of the Statistics around current supply of permanent supportive housing and the current need and so I want to give Jeff that opportunity first.,104,,
403,0.97,3251.381,3257.387,And then hear separately from Derek and Tim and have a bit more of a conversation with them.,104,,
404,0.97,3257.387,3260.69,"So, Jeff, why don't you kick us off here.",104,,
405,0.97,3260.69,3261.458,Sure.,105,,
406,0.97,3261.458,3263.693,"Thank you, Mr. chair.",105,,
407,0.97,3263.693,3264.961,"Jeff Simms, council central staff.",105,,
408,0.97,3264.961,3279.609,So the permanent supportive housing as just discussed by Ketil and is the subject of the legislation on the agenda is the primary Evidence-Based strategy to provide services to people that experience chronic homelessness.,105,,
409,0.97,3279.609,3282.612,Chronic homeless is an acute experience of homelessness.,105,,
410,0.97,3282.612,3287.217,There's a two part division to determine when a person is defined as chronically homeless.,105,,
411,0.97,3287.217,3314.911,"First they either would have experienced homelessness for more than a year or over the course of four separate episodes of homelessness over the course of three years experienced a totality of 12 months of homelessness and in addition to one of those pieces on just--based on the duration or the length of time they experienced homelessness, the person also has to have a disabling condition, so something like a serious illness, perhaps substance use disorder or something along those lines.",105,,
412,0.97,3314.911,3327.59,"Every year in January our continuing of care does a count at the end of January to estimate just at that point in time how many people are experiencing homelessness, because it's an attempt at capturing population it's difficult to find.",105,,
413,0.97,3327.59,3333.463,Why they are regarded as an Undercount but some of the best data that we have and it's done nationally.,105,,
414,0.97,3333.463,3346.71,"Our point in time counts this most recent January identified 3,355 people or estimated 3,355 people that experienced chronic homelessness.",105,,
415,0.97,3346.71,3362.959,"That is there are other groups that estimate higher numbers, for example, the third door coalition has noted in a memo, has developed a methodology that estimates we have a larger population than that, closer to 6,500 people that would require Psh.",105,,
416,0.97,3362.959,3365.895,I'm still working to get a better understanding of their methodology.,105,,
417,0.97,3365.895,3371.401,They have been helpful in providing more information on that.,105,,
418,0.97,3371.401,3376.206,Currently we have approximately--actually want to be cautious in giving exact numbers.,105,,
419,0.97,3376.206,3396.626,"Let's say we have around 5500 Psh units and maybe around 1,000 coming Online and the challenge in giving that number precisely is because what gets defined as a Psh unit in terms of the level of services or what would be counted as active versus in the pipeline, those types of things can vary and sometimes it's hard to call something as it's definitely in this bucket versus a different one.",105,,
420,0.97,3396.626,3412.275,"But overall you will be talking about something like 6,500 units of permanent supportive housing that are already available and that's in addition--more than 3,000 people that have been identified as chronically homeless.",105,,
421,0.97,3412.275,3415.011,They are still currently homeless.,105,,
422,0.97,3415.011,3416.746,They are not housed.,105,,
423,0.97,3416.746,3424.087,"And likely the 6,500 or some units that we have of permanent supportive housing--experienced chronic homeless in the past.",105,,
424,0.97,3424.087,3426.689,You want to talk about the numbers differently.,105,,
425,0.97,3426.689,3438.835,"With that, something in the range of 2,000, 2,500 gap if you use that estimate, though there's a lot of other approaches someone can use.",105,,
426,0.97,3438.835,3446.176,"With that, I will stop and take any questions or turn it over to our other Presenters.",105,,
427,0.97,3446.176,3452.081,Are there any initial questions for Jeff?,106,,
428,0.97,3452.081,3452.449,Okay.,106,,
429,0.97,3452.449,3453.249,"Thank you, Jeff.",106,,
430,0.97,3453.249,3454.217,For providing that baseline information.,106,,
431,0.97,3454.217,3467.063,"I think it's important because there's a lot of discussion and conversations for any of the media on a regular basis about, you know, what are we going to do to make progress on homelessness.",106,,
432,0.97,3467.063,3480.376,We really know what we do need to do and the Metrics that you just laid down helps make that clear in the scope and scale of the need and how we can keep making progress on it.,106,,
433,0.97,3480.376,3490.92,And that's a perfect introduction to Tim and Derek to talk a little bit more about what their providers do in that critical space.,106,,
434,0.97,3490.92,3513.409,"Tim with housing, Derek with chief Seattle Club, both doing really outstanding work in the community, providing really great permanent supportive housing placements and both chief Seattle Club and Plymouth were really key Stakeholders in crafting this initial draft of the legislation and really appreciate their feedback and input.",106,,
435,0.97,3513.409,3518.348,"So, Tim, why don't we start with you.",106,,
436,0.97,3518.348,3532.495,Just provide an overview of how this legislation is going to impact projects Plymouth is putting together.,106,,
437,0.97,3532.495,3545.008,And experiences you have experienced as a developer in getting more units Online because of regulations that don't necessarily apply to permanent supportive housing but might be appropriate for market rate housing.,106,,
438,0.97,3545.008,3547.677,"So with that, Tim, I will turn it over to you.",106,,
439,0.97,3547.677,3548.211,Thank you.,106,,
440,0.97,3548.211,3555.552,"Thank you, Councilmember Lewis, and thank you for your foresight on this, this legislation.",107,,
441,0.97,3555.552,3570.133,"So as has been mentioned I work at Plymouth housing, Plymouth has been around for 40 years providing permanent supportive housing in and around downtown Seattle and we serve that population that Jeff was mentioning, folks that are chronically homeless.",107,,
442,0.97,3570.133,3575.838,So not folks that have run across hard times and need somewhere for a few months to get back on their feet.,107,,
443,0.97,3575.838,3585.181,These are folks with many issues like many of us have and they need permanent housing before they can address any other issues in their life.,107,,
444,0.97,3585.181,3599.729,"We operate 15 buildings with little over 1,000 apartments for folks that are experiencing homelessness and they are all studios or Single-Room occupancy for homeless individuals.",107,,
445,0.97,3599.729,3620.516,"We are just really excited about this legislation and, you know, we are five years into this state of emergency on homelessness and to me this is just the first most logical step that is the most obvious for the city.",107,,
446,0.97,3620.516,3643.606,"There's no cost impacts, but there is huge potential benefits and increasing the efficiency, which permanent supportive housing providers can bring these units Online during this period of critical media of whether that's, you know, there's some debate on the numbers, like Jeff said, 3,000 or 6,000 units for a chronically homeless individual that we need.",107,,
447,0.97,3643.606,3673.603,"We currently have six projects in development, around 600 apartments, and many of them would, frankly, be built already if we had legislation like this enacted, you know, previously, and I don't have much of a presentation prepared but the other factor I will touch on that relates to some of these folks, what are the folks like that live at Plymouth and Seattle Club maybe?",107,,
448,0.97,3673.603,3681.577,Our demographics are that almost everyone has some sort of disability or mobility challenge.,107,,
449,0.97,3681.577,3686.382,So I think like 96% of our thousand or so residents have some sort of disability.,107,,
450,0.97,3686.382,3706.436,"Almost 60% of them have a mental health condition, and I think we are approaching half of our portfolio, being at or above the age of 55, and many of the folks are people of color, about half are people of color.",107,,
451,0.97,3706.436,3713.71,And I give you that because the demographics matter.,107,,
452,0.97,3713.71,3717.046,"Legislative things we are talking about, particular around bicycle parking.",107,,
453,0.97,3717.046,3718.581,I'll touch on that first.,107,,
454,0.97,3718.581,3739.335,"You know, I'm a big bike fan myself, and I am trained as a city planner so it's a little awkward, but in this circumstance I just don't think it makes sense for permanent supportive housing to be so restrictive on the location and the amount of bike parking.",107,,
455,0.97,3739.335,3749.946,"Our tenants, you know, there's like a handful across our thousand apartments that even own a bicycle and if they do, they usually prefer to keep it in their apartment.",107,,
456,0.97,3749.946,3756.352,We are making design accommodations in our new buildings in addition to the code required bike parking.,107,,
457,0.97,3756.352,3759.322,Our team Costed it out on a couple of projects.,107,,
458,0.97,3759.322,3772.935,"We are talking around three or $500,000 per bike room at currently required, which Coincidentally is about the cost of providing another housing unit, getting another person that's chronically homeless off the street.",107,,
459,0.97,3772.935,3779.976,So we do definitely provide more housing without that bike requirement--bike parking requirement.,107,,
460,0.97,3779.976,3783.146,It's also the location of that space.,107,,
461,0.97,3783.146,3807.403,"It has to be close to the entry and most of our buildings are what's called five over two construction so we are building the bike rooms and really expensive, the most expensive part of the building in concrete walls near the front of the I wanted to go back a little bit on Councilmember Herbold's thoughts around design review.",107,,
462,0.97,3807.403,3831.093,I will be interested to see what the city reports on these pilot projects that are currently under development without the design review process but I think which would see around a four to six-month faster permanently schedule without design review and then you get into the harder to quantity benefits.,107,,
463,0.97,3831.093,3836.165,There's one that I know of right off the top of my head as a developer and that's how much we have to pay our architects.,107,,
464,0.97,3836.165,3852.114,"I would say it's probably two to $300,000 for a project less to not have to put together a design review project packet, whether it's being reviewed by somebody in administrative or by the public.",107,,
465,0.97,3852.114,3866.796,"There is significant cost savings, time Savings and again, there's still a commitment by providers to do a good job with the community to ensure if design is a pressing issue in a community, we are going to hear about that and hopefully make those changes as appropriate.",107,,
466,0.97,3866.796,3867.864,So I wanted to touch on that.,107,,
467,0.97,3867.864,3876.339,But I will turn it over to Derek to had anything else he wants to.,107,,
468,0.97,3876.339,3876.772,"Thank you, Tim.",108,,
469,0.97,3876.772,3876.973,Yeah.,108,,
470,0.97,3876.973,3880.409,"So, obviously, Tim has been in this game a lot longer than we have.",108,,
471,0.97,3880.409,3886.716,Chief Seattle Club we have gotten two development projects underway now.,108,,
472,0.97,3886.716,3889.719,"Our first one, downtown Pioneer square.",108,,
473,0.97,3889.719,3892.555,30% of the way through the project now.,108,,
474,0.97,3892.555,3893.256,It's our first one.,108,,
475,0.97,3893.256,3897.994,"Scheduled to be finished, which we did, October 6th.",108,,
476,0.97,3897.994,3906.002,"And our other one, permanent supportive housing project in Lake City, we are looking at late '21 break ground, I'm thinking.",108,,
477,0.97,3906.002,3907.637,So we haven't really got in there yet.,108,,
478,0.97,3907.637,3922.285,But I have been through the process now a couple of times in some of this early design phase and I do know it's very stressful and we have that argument internally about the space that we are losing because of the bike room.,108,,
479,0.97,3922.285,3925.521,"You know, it's not even just the units.",108,,
480,0.97,3925.521,3935.631,"Keep in mind too it's valuable space usually on the first floor that we are thinking of--you know, I said earlier the activity space that's so crucial, bringing people together, healing.",108,,
481,0.97,3935.631,3943.639,"We want to make a nurses' station, we have to decide whether or not we are going to do that or the bike room.",108,,
482,0.97,3943.639,3945.408,So we have been through that.,108,,
483,0.97,3945.408,3951.881,And we have--I felt the headaches too of the design review and all that too.,108,,
484,0.97,3951.881,3956.686,So--and just the temperature check I have done with our development consultants.,108,,
485,0.97,3956.686,3969.865,"These are all common problems that I know I have heard everybody talk about, like Tim was just talking about, the cost savings, the time saving, so many benefits to actually revamp and streamline this process.",108,,
486,0.97,3969.865,3976.939,"We are trying to save people's lives and get people housed, especially the most chronic, the most vulnerable.",108,,
487,0.97,3976.939,3981.911,"It wasn't mental health issue, we have got to get them housed and we need to streamline the process.",108,,
488,0.97,3981.911,3988.584,"Anything that can do that and bring our people back in, indoors and safe is good.",108,,
489,0.97,3988.584,3989.051,Thank you.,109,,
490,0.97,3989.051,3992.922,I am sure there's going to be a lot of questions.,109,,
491,0.97,3992.922,4000.296,I want to jump on this theme with both of you a little bit more on the bike storage question.,109,,
492,0.97,4000.296,4003.299,Because I think it's a delicate area for a lot of us.,109,,
493,0.97,4003.299,4022.318,"You know, I included it in the first draft because I wanted to center your experience, center buildings, what you go through as developers and community leaders in putting these projects together and I heard uniformly this was something that really needed to be in this bill.",109,,
494,0.97,4022.318,4040.736,"I wonder if you guys could expand a little bit more because we know there are folks in permanent supportive housing who do use bikes and how it's a primary mode of Transportation for them, not at the same density as there are in market rate housing.",109,,
495,0.97,4040.736,4055.885,"But Tim in particular, you mentioned that a lot of residents, if they do have bikes, tend to prefer to store them in their unit or there are other ways to deal with Biking as an option for the residents who do want to use it.",109,,
496,0.97,4055.885,4087.95,"I wonder if you might just expand a little bit on that, centering the needs and the experiences of the people who live in your units who do use bikes and the kinds of planning you guys will continue to incorporate in your projects if this requirement isn't there to reflect your unique needs and it current--is kind of a blunt object.",109,,
497,0.97,4087.95,4089.452,"Tim, why don't you go first and then Derek.",109,,
498,0.97,4089.452,4090.119,"Thank you, Councilmember.",110,,
499,0.97,4090.119,4116.612,"One of the things that we are doing at one of our buildings under construction and looking to do at all of them, actually, is adding hooks for people to store conveniently and giving some foresight to the design inside people's apartments where you can hang up a bike, keep it safe and I think that's often the case what we hear of the few tenants that we have that are bicycle owners, is they want to keep it with them.",110,,
500,0.97,4116.612,4122.384,It's one of their valued possessions and they want to keep eyes on it.,110,,
501,0.97,4122.384,4125.855,The other thing I will go back to is our population.,110,,
502,0.97,4125.855,4134.463,"You know, there are bicycle owners, but I feel like this may be, you know, to Derek's point, we have to look at the policy context here.",110,,
503,0.97,4134.463,4142.605,We are trying to save people's lives and get them off the street.,110,,
504,0.97,4142.605,4160.422,Time will change and encouraging bike riding is important but I just would defer to the providers here to allow us to be flexible and not necessarily be legislated into exactly how big the bike areas are.,110,,
505,0.97,4160.422,4177.306,"We will still continue to plan for bikes in our new buildings, but we will work with our staff and our residents to find them the right way to do that.",110,,
506,0.97,4177.306,4178.307,Thank you.,111,,
507,0.97,4178.307,4178.541,Derek.,111,,
508,0.97,4178.541,4178.807,Yes.,112,,
509,0.97,4178.807,4198.093,"We haven't had our structures built yet but we have equal village in Sodo, 29 rooms there and it opened up last October so it's been open about a year and I think we have two bike racks in there and now it's--I think we have about three bikes we see in there and that's probably people who have been housed for the whole year.",112,,
510,0.97,4198.093,4200.796,And I agree with Tim.,112,,
511,0.97,4200.796,4207.036,"People, whenever they have bikes, they are just as valuable to them as car are to car owners.",112,,
512,0.97,4207.036,4218.981,"And I don't see them being used unit per parking space or whatever it is, the formula, it seems ridiculous.",112,,
513,0.97,4218.981,4230.225,"Day to day at Seattle Club, obviously, Pre-Covid, we were seeing about 130, maybe 140 people a day homeless and, you know, we would see maybe two or three bikes come through.",112,,
514,0.97,4230.225,4234.363,"So that tells you, you know, what we are dealing with and the fleet for bikes.",112,,
515,0.97,4234.363,4241.036,"But, I mean, put out there, though, somebody housed, their willingness to get a bike might change.",112,,
516,0.97,4241.036,4248.911,But we don't really see a need for a lot of bike storage.,112,,
517,0.97,4248.911,4251.247,Really appreciate that context from both of you.,113,,
518,0.97,4251.247,4252.081,Thank you so much.,113,,
519,0.97,4252.081,4255.951,"So with that, I want to open it up to other questions from my colleagues.",113,,
520,0.97,4255.951,4268.197,Anyone have questions for Tim and Derek?,113,,
521,0.97,4268.197,4268.464,Great.,113,,
522,0.97,4268.464,4270.165,Look how thorough you guys were.,113,,
523,0.97,4270.165,4270.466,Great job.,113,,
524,0.97,4270.466,4275.471,"Plenty of time for that later, given that we are very early in this process.",113,,
525,0.97,4275.471,4295.291,"This was just a first bite at the apple for people to identify issues, to really hear the need directly from Tim and Derek who are on the front lines and by no means are Tim and Derek the exhaustive representatives.",113,,
526,0.97,4295.291,4309.938,"You know, we could--we are probably going to have folks in the future from Desc and from Lehigh and so many of the other local providers and developers who are doing this critical work all with very similar concerns and who have been very helpful throughout this process.",113,,
527,0.97,4309.938,4319.214,"So Tim and Derek, thank you for being available today to kick this process off and really get us rolling.",113,,
528,0.97,4319.214,4329.024,We will certainly call you back as we have more questions and as we continue to vet this legislation in January and appreciate you making yourselves available.,113,,
529,0.97,4329.024,4330.993,So thank you so much.,113,,
530,0.97,4330.993,4338.434,And thank you to central staff for Cuing this up and answering the critical technical questions at that early stage.,113,,
531,0.97,4338.434,4349.578,It's always good to get those flagged early and start working on those issues well in advance.,113,,
532,0.97,4349.578,4355.451,"So I want to pivot now, since we are doing pretty good on time --",113,,
533,0.97,4355.451,4355.684,Hey.,114,,
534,0.97,4355.684,4355.951,Yes.,115,,
535,0.97,4355.951,4356.118,Oh.,115,,
536,0.97,4356.118,4356.318,Yes.,115,,
537,0.97,4356.318,4360.189,Just saying goodbye to Derek.,116,,
538,0.97,4360.189,4360.456,Yeah.,117,,
539,0.97,4360.456,4360.689,I saw.,117,,
540,0.97,4360.689,4361.023,That's great.,117,,
541,0.97,4361.023,4380.309,"It was--you know, I really appreciate when we as a Council can just take advantage of the awesome wealth of community that we have in the city and without Derek this bill wouldn't be here so I want to express my appreciation to him too.",117,,
542,0.97,4380.309,4389.618,"Moving onto item 2, so I thought it was important--well, first, Jacob, can you please read item 2 into the record.",117,,
543,0.97,4389.618,4396.258,Briefing in discussion on 2021 homelessness strategies and investment.,118,,
544,0.97,4396.258,4397.359,"Thank you, Jacob.",119,,
545,0.97,4397.359,4411.507,"And the Presenters are going to be deputy Mayor--and from the public defender Association and I believe they are all present with us, which is great.",119,,
546,0.97,4411.507,4437.533,"So I did just want to say at the top of this, we made a considerable amount of investments for outreach, for transitional shelter, for completely redefining how we are going to conduct business as a city in terms of leading with engagement, leading with outreach, going forward in 2021.",119,,
547,0.97,4437.533,4442.805,"As a Council, that's the vision that we manifested in our budget that we passed at the end of last month.",119,,
548,0.97,4442.805,4482.244,"I realize it is still 2020 and these are 2021 investments but it's never too early to hear from some of our partners who are going to be the recipients of many of those resources and from the executive on the status and Scaling up these new investments and these new approaches for 2021 to make progress on what all of us see every day in our communities, the incredible crisis several years into the state of emergency on this crisis of homelessness in Seattle and King County.",119,,
549,0.97,4482.244,4531.36,"You know, some of the key things I want to flag at the top but I do want to go through and give our panelists opportunities to briefly introduce themselves and then if we might have a conversation first about maybe where we are on some of the Timeline to standing up some of these added investments, might be good to hear, for example, you know, where we are on the Hoteling, where we are on tiny House villages, where we are on the enhanced shelter and then also an update on the hope team and the work that that Chloe, Lisa and the human services Department have been doing to strengthen our outreach efforts.",119,,
550,0.97,4531.36,4539.668,I know that work continues to be ongoing and it would be good to get an update for the committee and for the public today.,119,,
551,0.97,4539.668,4555.217,But then giving an opportunity for committee members to have an open-ended discussion generally about these homelessness investments and I'm sure it will be a conversation we will be Reconvening in at the committee in January for another update.,119,,
552,0.97,4555.217,4560.956,"So with that, I want to give our panelists an opportunity to introduce themselves.",119,,
553,0.97,4560.956,4569.998,"Casey, why don't we start with you, deputy Mayor Sixkiller and then Chloe and then Lisa.",119,,
554,0.97,4569.998,4573.268,"Just to clarify, you just want me to introduce myself or launch in?",120,,
555,0.97,4573.268,4582.644,"Why don't we go through and just say name and role, introductions.",121,,
556,0.97,4582.644,4594.256,"And then why don't we go on after we go through that round of introductions, Casey, why don't we come back to you first and then hear from Lisa and Chloe and then open it up to general questions.",121,,
557,0.97,4594.256,4597.025,That sounds great.,122,,
558,0.97,4597.025,4597.426,Good afternoon.,122,,
559,0.97,4597.426,4612.841,"Iname is Casey Sixkiller, deputy Mayor, Mayor's office.",122,,
560,0.97,4612.841,4621.55,"My name other Chloe Gayle, I'm Ray director for the reach program.",123,,
561,0.97,4621.55,4626.722,"I'm Luisa Dugard, at the public defender Association.",124,,
562,0.97,4626.722,4641.837,"So Casey, now that we are all introduced, why don't we go back to you and get a broad overview of the budget adds the Council has made and how the executive team is approaching this.",125,,
563,0.97,4641.837,4644.106,I want to clarify some of my early remarks.,125,,
564,0.97,4644.106,4657.085,We did make some of these outreach investments and outreach changes through legislation I introduced in the 2020 budget as well.,125,,
565,0.97,4657.085,4665.06,"This is not just about the 2021 investments, we are talking about an ongoing outreach project that we have been working on for the last several months.",125,,
566,0.97,4665.06,4666.962,Feel free to include that in your remarks.,125,,
567,0.97,4666.962,4676.471,I don't want the panelists to feel like they were hemmed into what is prospective.,125,,
568,0.97,4676.471,4678.14,There are ongoing issues as well.,125,,
569,0.97,4678.14,4689.418,"Thank you, Councilmember and Council, I appreciate the opportunity to come before you toward the end of the year and provide an update about a number of efforts that are underway within Hsd in particular.",126,,
570,0.97,4689.418,4702.631,"Many of them, all of them, actually, supported by Council through the 2021 adopted budget and as Councilmember Lewis just Referenced some additional things we are working on between now and the end of the year that are a holdover from the 2020 budget.",126,,
571,0.97,4702.631,4710.305,"If you can hit a few of those highlights, give you an update of where we are at and then I'll turn it over to Chloe and Lisa.",126,,
572,0.97,4710.305,4735.297,"So first and foremost as we think about, as we work toward our surge and our street to housing efforts in 2021, we are in the process of finalizing three different Rfqs to do that work and that includes number one, we have now narrowed the field down to three of five potential hotels to lease.",126,,
573,0.97,4735.297,4759.354,"So FAS is working through that process now with potential locations that--after a really pretty wide search that went from, I think, somewhere in the '90s, potential properties to, again, now as we have gone through the series of site visits and other work with potential host hotels, down to 35.",126,,
574,0.97,4759.354,4771.633,"So our goal is still to bring one of those hotels Online potentially toward last week of this month, probably more likely at this point not until the beginning, early part of January.",126,,
575,0.97,4771.633,4776.505,So that's very exciting for us.,126,,
576,0.97,4776.505,4798.894,"The second is, you know, we are working and we will be announcing soon who our hotel operator or operators are going to be, so we have hotels themselves and then we have the folks, those agencies who are going to be actually managing these shelter assets for the city and so we have finalized that process as well.",126,,
577,0.97,4798.894,4807.402,And we will be sending out those award letters here shortly and beginning to negotiate those contracts.,126,,
578,0.97,4807.402,4817.779,"The third part of that, of the Rfq world is our street to housing Rfq so this is our rapid Rehousing services that we feel confident will be able to serve up to 231 people.",126,,
579,0.97,4817.779,4824.386,We have identified a service provider for that as well and we will be able to make that announcement here shortly.,126,,
580,0.97,4824.386,4838.333,"So by, you know, very beginning of December--of January, announced the location of our hotels, announce our hotel operator or operators and then also announce our rapid Re- housing service provider.",126,,
581,0.97,4838.333,4864.626,"Just as a reminder, our goal is to stand up 300 new temporary shelter units and in addition to that, 125 new enhanced Noncongregant shelter spaces using--thank you very much to Council for supporting that proposal by the Mayor and working with us in that.",126,,
582,0.97,4864.626,4871.867,We are excited to be able to bring on these new assets.,126,,
583,0.97,4871.867,4881.376,Councilmember Lewis mentioned his legislation and our 2020 outreach dollars that remain from a few different moves earlier this fall.,126,,
584,0.97,4881.376,4889.517,We have about a million dollars in money set aside for additional outreach activity.,126,,
585,0.97,4889.517,4927.989,"About $265,000 of that will be spent extending the hotel stay for individuals who previously were residing at the ever spring Inn so we have Úauthorized that work that was universal request from an outreach continuum of preventing the potential for those individuals to exit from hotels into homelessness and so we are excited about that and unified response so that work is moving forward and I want to thank Lisa Dugard and the PD for stepping in and stepping up to to support those individuals and working in partnership with us.",126,,
586,0.97,4927.989,4931.426,"So that leaves about $800,000 left.",126,,
587,0.97,4931.426,4936.598,We have been Collating requests from the service outreach provider continuum about things they could use.,126,,
588,0.97,4936.598,4943.972,Those types of--that they can procure here at the end of 2020.,126,,
589,0.97,4943.972,4964.159,"Those include tents, sleeping bags, heaters, blankets, socks, shoes, gift cards, lots of different things to try to keep people warm and safe as we head into continued dark cold and often wet days over the next several weeks and months.",126,,
590,0.97,4964.159,4965.794,So that process is moving forward as well.,126,,
591,0.97,4965.794,4968.096,We are not making it hard.,126,,
592,0.97,4968.096,4971.866,We are not amending contracts and creating some new Rfp process.,126,,
593,0.97,4971.866,4987.215,We ever trying to make it as simple and streamlined as partners so our outreach partners can be focused on what they do and not a bunch of paperwork that SLOWS everything down.,126,,
594,0.97,4987.215,4996.891,Also related to Councilmember Lewis' legislation we have been working with the outreach continuum on a mutual vision for outreach in the city.,126,,
595,0.97,4996.891,5025.687,"We are learning a lot about each other, at least now that I am involved in that, learning more about where we have opportunities for improvement, where we continue to have perhaps some friction, but I have to say that I have really appreciated the opportunity to work with our outreach continuum and think through solutions and new approaches for a number of--you know, for our overall response to unsheltered homelessness.",126,,
596,0.97,5025.687,5026.421,There is work going on.,126,,
597,0.97,5026.421,5034.029,"I know there's been some talk publicly about outreach is no longer occurring, that is not true.",126,,
598,0.97,5034.029,5036.264,All of our contracts are active.,126,,
599,0.97,5036.264,5058.953,"I think Chloe Gayle can talk about the work her team is doing across the city, the PDA has deployed, a lot of folks are involved in both helping move folks out of shelter--excuse me, off the street and into some form of shelter while also trying to meet their needs given that they are going to remain outside.",126,,
600,0.97,5058.953,5064.559,So obviously there's work going on in a number of parks across our park system today.,126,,
601,0.97,5064.559,5074.869,Lisa Dugard I'm sure will talk about the work that the PDA and reach and others are doing with County resources called just care in the China town and Pioneer square area.,126,,
602,0.97,5074.869,5078.006,We are learning a lot about what that work looks like.,126,,
603,0.97,5090.919,5106.034,"A few other places around the city as well as working with other Stakeholders on--you know, whether it's construction projects or other obstructions that were coordinated work and outreach from our contracted providers helpful in resolving some of those issues.",126,,
604,0.97,5106.034,5112.574,So we continue to work through that.,126,,
605,0.97,5112.574,5127.088,"And also working through how we can have a more coordinated and geographic approach to how we are conducting outreach and again, I want to thank Chloe and her team and others for their participation in that work.",126,,
606,0.97,5127.088,5143.271,"We also are Larning as part of this conversation where our technology lags behind and I think that is in particular around the shelter, you know, just the Database around available shelter on a daily basis and a number of other things.",126,,
607,0.97,5143.271,5166.995,I also want to thank our hope team and again folks that work with our outreach continuing for participating in conversations and trying to figure out how we can make the technology work for us and for those who are in shelter and rather than working against us and being sort of an impediment to getting resources out in the field.,126,,
608,0.97,5166.995,5178.072,"I'm sure Chloe will talk about some of the innovative things that reach is doing, both to connect people to shelter but also meet their needs as we go into cold months.",126,,
609,0.97,5178.072,5179.674,So I won't go into that here.,126,,
610,0.97,5179.674,5181.142,I want to talk about the hope team.,126,,
611,0.97,5181.142,5203.431,"I mentioned they have been involved in all these discussions about the future of outreach and also working with them to help coordinate referrals into the shelter systems so over just the first month, full implementation of this new hope team--Seattle health Corps, the mid and others.",126,,
612,0.97,5203.431,5211.806,"Again, the hope team it is--who are they finding the best match for available resources fore their clients.",126,,
613,0.97,5211.806,5224.252,Also means that we are working to cross 15 different outreach agencies or contract--so both are contracted and Noncontracted partners to submit these recommendations for referrals into vacant spots.,126,,
614,0.97,5224.252,5228.957,A lot of work going on on the back end from the hope team.,126,,
615,0.97,5228.957,5243.938,"I think those folks, our team has really started to settle into its new role and I think really approached that work in collaborative--a collaborative way.",126,,
616,0.97,5243.938,5245.673,Try and think what else.,126,,
617,0.97,5245.673,5250.378,Last thing I would say is we are making a number of severe weather preparations.,126,,
618,0.97,5250.378,5258.953,"You know, we were fortunate last year, fortunate last year that the onset of Covid came after our winter--our first winter snow.",126,,
619,0.97,5258.953,5282.01,"We did have a cold batch, a little little spot in March, April, but Nevertheless we are working to prepare our severe weather spaces, that includes City hall, Smt, pavilion, community centers, working with our contracted partners and others to make sure they are prepared so we can stand up the resources as necessary.",126,,
620,0.97,5282.01,5289.717,Again the hope team will be the one coordinating that outreach and transportation to sites as parted of our winter weather response for the city.,126,,
621,0.97,5289.717,5312.306,"The last thing I wanted to mention is our--is what we are doing around encampment trash mitigation and as well as the clean cities initiative, there is, I want to be clear, that the clean cities initiative which the Council supported is not focused exclusively on encampment trash mitigation and removal.",126,,
622,0.97,5312.306,5315.91,They are not in charge of Removals at all.,126,,
623,0.97,5315.91,5327.488,"The clean cities initiative is an inter departmental coordinated effort with parks and Sdot staff, the support from Spu contractors.",126,,
624,0.97,5327.488,5335.697,"It's an all hands on deck for trash, graffiti removal, trash removal, six plus months of deferred maintenance across the city.",126,,
625,0.97,5335.697,5338.566,There are times when that work will intersect with Encampments.,126,,
626,0.97,5338.566,5359.253,"That's why our parks team and our--which has field Coordinators who did work with encampment inhabitants to deal with personal property or, most importantly, I think be able to work with them to identify what trash and other resources--or what trash and other refuse they may want removed from that encampment and that seems to be going well.",126,,
627,0.97,5359.253,5374.268,"To say that last week alone we collected 110,000 pounds of trash from our new community litter routes to parks, Jamborees and other citywide trash collecting efforts.",126,,
628,0.97,5374.268,5381.609,Last year they were at County park and a few other places doing a more focused effort.,126,,
629,0.97,5381.609,5386.981,"So just to Recap Council, hotels coming in line beginning in January.",126,,
630,0.97,5386.981,5394.989,Hotel operator and other partners who will help us our street to housing approach will be announced in the next couple of weeks.,126,,
631,0.97,5394.989,5400.328,We are continuing our work with our contracted outreach providers.,126,,
632,0.97,5400.328,5406.3,We have a winter weather plan in place and ready to go if and when we Fet to that.,126,,
633,0.97,5406.3,5424.352,"And then our clean cities program is now up and running and we will be doing regular reporting, have a public dashboard so everyone can track where we have been, where we are planning to go and what the output from that effort is.",126,,
634,0.97,5424.352,5424.719,Councilmember.,126,,
635,0.97,5424.719,5425.386,Thank you.,127,,
636,0.97,5425.386,5426.554,"Very thorough, Mr. deputy Mayor.",127,,
637,0.97,5426.554,5435.329,And folks can hold their questions until after we hear in Chloe and Lisa as well and then we will do all the questions at once.,127,,
638,0.97,5435.329,5439.834,I think that would be best and really appreciate that initial presentation.,127,,
639,0.97,5439.834,5445.74,"So Chloe, can we hear an update from you next?",127,,
640,0.97,5445.74,5446.007,Sure.,128,,
641,0.97,5446.007,5452.914,I am happy to build on what deputy Mayor Sixkiller has spoken to.,128,,
642,0.97,5452.914,5460.288,The reach has been really engaged as part of the effort to try to redesign our unsheltered response.,128,,
643,0.97,5460.288,5482.143,"And I'm actually really excited that we are going after your whole presentation on permanent supportive housing because that is the solution to our unsheltered response, is that the vast majority of the folks that we are finding outside really need long-term housing and many, many of them need supportive housing.",128,,
644,0.97,5482.143,5483.077,Excellent programs you described earlier.,128,,
645,0.97,5483.077,5489.617,"In the meantime while we have a lot of people outside and not in safe places for them to go indoors, we are trying to create a better system.",128,,
646,0.97,5489.617,5516.277,"I will call it a couple of items we are definitely trying to improve our referral system to get people to shelters with the new hotels coming Online and I want to thank the hope team members who are very active in Redesigning that process and trying to ensure that their service match so the people who come inside and get their needs met inside of the shelters and that they also are put on a Pathway towards permanent housing, which is what they need.",128,,
647,0.97,5516.277,5526.22,So that's been a critical piece and it is a lot to manage all in the other outreach--or outreach partners who have also been at the table helping to design that plan.,128,,
648,0.97,5526.22,5540.234,I also wanted to talk a little bit about our principals coming in in terms of supporting the hope team has helped support us thinking about hygiene and sanitation services and that is critical and still--[Audio difficulty],128,,
649,0.97,5540.234,5546.107,There is not adequate hygiene and sanitation for people living outside.,129,,
650,0.97,5546.107,5549.977,"Secondly, the trash mitigation which is spoken to a little bit.",129,,
651,0.97,5549.977,5560.555,"The Spu teams have been cooperative and helpful and as one of my staff recently said a couple weeks ago, when we are working in coordination with people living outside, people want their trash picked up.",129,,
652,0.97,5560.555,5563.658,"He said, I've never found anybody who didn't actually want their trash picked up.",129,,
653,0.97,5563.658,5573.968,"It really is how we go about that in a way that is supportive of them and makes sense for the area, so sometimes people collect their own trash and put them into purple bags.",129,,
654,0.97,5573.968,5585.546,And sometimes people really need help and there's definitely a lot of illegal dumping happening all over our community that is exacerbating the amount of trash outside and that people living outside are having to contest with.,129,,
655,0.97,5585.546,5591.085,So we have really appreciated the Spu partners on designing that.,129,,
656,0.97,5591.085,5593.354,"And then Finally, survival supplies are really significant.",129,,
657,0.97,5593.354,5601.862,"People have to have a way to stay warm, get food, try to stay dry in this weather.",129,,
658,0.97,5601.862,5604.365,It's really--as an incredible challenge.,129,,
659,0.97,5604.365,5641.602,"And part of that, I'll just mention the reach program is--has started a new project which is a Pop-Up outside office model so you may see those around the community and we are happy to communicate more about that, which is we have had tents and we have actually worked with private landowners and neighborhoods all over the city and are staff are there on a regular basis so people can come, reach out, they can have access to Wi-Fi and connective services and Ideally they can get warm and we are quite concerned about people staying warm through the severe weather in the next few months.",129,,
660,0.97,5641.602,5659.487,"I do want to say that all of this work for us has really been towards and I think Lisa is going to speak more towards the provider, the providers working with the city to design a framework in terms of how we Dak about unsheltered response.",129,,
661,0.97,5659.487,5679.807,"For us on the ground we are looking at creating a problem solving strategies so I want to name some of those things, which is that we are preventing Removals or moving people whenever possible as we know the CDC does not want anyone displaced and moved around during this really critical time of disease mitigation.",129,,
662,0.97,5679.807,5689.817,We want to coordinate with the people living outside so we start with a neighborhood Community-Based approach where we know who is there and that we design solutions in partnership with them.,129,,
663,0.97,5689.817,5704.398,"So if that's a Port-A-Pott for their area, if that's a hand washing station, if that's getting their trash removed, if that's--sometimes it's better for them to move to another location that we can work in partnership with people to help figure that out.",129,,
664,0.97,5704.398,5706.033,Ideally to move people inside.,129,,
665,0.97,5706.033,5709.67,"And finally, to do more community coordination.",129,,
666,0.97,5709.67,5721.615,So our problem-solving model is really looking at how do we also solve for the community because different communities have different needs.,129,,
667,0.97,5721.615,5723.651,I'm going to talk one minute about the just care project.,129,,
668,0.97,5723.651,5726.72,I know Lisa will have a lot more to say.,129,,
669,0.97,5726.72,5731.459,The Association has been the architect of that so they get the credit.,129,,
670,0.97,5731.459,5747.742,But I will say that's been an incredible opportunity using some funds from the county to really try to create a demonstration model in two critical neighborhoods in China town International district and in Pioneer square and I'm going to speak a little bit.,129,,
671,0.97,5747.742,5762.323,We have been looking--reach has been trying to organize the street response and we did it with a lot of Intentionality to bring in our community partner so we are working together to--and then to really learn about who is living outside and what their needs are.,129,,
672,0.97,5762.323,5770.498,And I am going to speak a little bit to what we learned just by doing intensive assessments in that area.,129,,
673,0.97,5770.498,5780.341,We have to date in those two neighborhoods assessed--had assessments of 165 individuals and those are pretty intensive.,129,,
674,0.97,5780.341,5793.587,People sign a release of information and we try to get some kind of a sense of what their needs are so we can accurately match them to resources and make sure that we are putting them on a good faith for stability.,129,,
675,0.97,5793.587,5801.028,Approximately 80% of the folks that we have seen in that area have been chronically homeless.,129,,
676,0.97,5801.028,5815.576,It is a significant need especially in neighborhoods that have high concentrations of people and of services and have traditionally been where people with high needs have congregated so 80% have been chronically homeless over a year.,129,,
677,0.97,5815.576,5819.547,The needs that they requested over 95% was housing.,129,,
678,0.97,5819.547,5831.392,That's number one choice but they also requested--79% requested substance abuse report.,129,,
679,0.97,5831.392,5832.393,40% requested physical health support.,129,,
680,0.97,5832.393,5837.498,Over 50% had legal issues that they needed to resolve.,129,,
681,0.97,5837.498,5839.6,And 45% had benefits issues.,129,,
682,0.97,5839.6,5849.343,So people are having very high needs that are trying to survive with and they are presented with significant barriers to move inside.,129,,
683,0.97,5849.343,5868.662,"In spite of that, with the excellent--we will speak to the resources that have come Online and the excellent partnership we have had with Asian counseling and referral service, the defenders Club and other partners who Le help design models to build them in.",129,,
684,0.97,5868.662,5873.601,We have managed to move 71 people into motels.,129,,
685,0.97,5873.601,5885.279,And they have--and those motels are intentionally staffed to respond to people's cultural and their behavioral health needs so that we know that they are being appropriately matched.,129,,
686,0.97,5885.279,5893.654,"I'll hand it over to Lisa, then.",129,,
687,0.97,5893.654,5893.887,Thanks.,129,,
688,0.97,5893.887,5898.659,"Thanks so much, Chloe, and thank you for having us, Councilmember Lewis and colleagues.",130,,
689,0.97,5898.659,5918.746,"Let me just explain how--first of all, the organization that I work with, the public defender Association hasn't provided public defense services for a few years and we are about to go through a Renaming process so next year you will probably hear me introducing myself from another--using another name.",130,,
690,0.97,5918.746,5942.436,"But for the time being, PDA finds itself in this conversation, not--we are actually not a city contractor to provide homelessness response or outreach, but we have a city contract to manage the lead program.",130,,
691,0.97,5942.436,5950.844,"Now lead stands for let everyone stand with dignity, previously law enforcement diversion.",130,,
692,0.97,5950.844,5967.628,"It's an alternative Community- based care response to problematic behavior and law violations, but over the lifetime of that program, between 75 and 80% of those that are referred to lead at point of referral are unsheltered.",130,,
693,0.97,5967.628,6014.808,"So there's always been a very strong degree of overlap and in 2020, let me rush through this background here, by way of introducing why I'm even sitting with you, in 2020, as Covid hit and really not only the jail, the courts, and law enforcement really closed down and drew back in their capacity to engage with low-level public order issues out of concern for Covid transmission, but those public order issues became more and more acute in neighborhoods as people experienced great need, shelters were Deintensified due to Covid.",130,,
694,0.97,6014.808,6021.415,"Lawful sources of income were cut off to people and neighborhoods were really, you know, emptied out of ordinary traffic.",130,,
695,0.97,6021.415,6062.089,"So as I think we all know in the city and regionally, the impact of people living unsheltered in neighborhoods became more and more acute and we just noticed that our lead resources might be useful in response to those conditions, so even though lead has never been defined as a homelessness response using lead resources to respond to the condition of people living unsheltered seemed an obvious priority in terms of an alternative response to law violations and public order issues.",130,,
696,0.97,6062.089,6079.706,"So we created the Co-Lead adaptation of lead earlier this year that Council has previously heard short briefings about, Co-Lead and there will be one leader this week on Thursday as well.",130,,
697,0.97,6079.706,6113.373,"That involved--that entailed recognizing that many people living in high impact situations outside, high impact they were impose the fact--posed public order issues for neighborhoods and businesses oftentimes that population is struggling with really acute need, as Chloe detailed.",130,,
698,0.97,6113.373,6126.22,And it has been the case for a long time that the ordinary systems of Healthcare and behavioral health are not particularly responsive to our accessible to this population.,130,,
699,0.97,6126.22,6149.309,This year that has been all the more true as--such as it is the behavioral Healthcare system sort of with drew behind a Telecare wall and for some people there have been some very favorable media coverage--or media stories about how that's made behavioral Healthcare more accessible to some people.,130,,
700,0.97,6149.309,6157.351,"That's definitely not the case for people who are living unsheltered or in Encampments, highly marginalized.",130,,
701,0.97,6157.351,6165.993,This just made an already pretty inaccessible system even less accessible.,130,,
702,0.97,6165.993,6214.374,"So we built a Co-Lead to really sort of step into that gap and attempt to do kind of like Pop- up behavioral health services, but also noticing, as many--as others did around the country that there was this sudden availability of hotel space that was not in use for other purposes and where the hospitality industry actually itself was suffering and needed to find an alternative use because of Connectins in the hospitality industry we identified hotels that were interested in taking some of our participants in.",130,,
703,0.97,6214.374,6226.587,We Co-Lead sort of straight up rapidly a system of intensive case management specifically to provide Wraparound care for people with acute behavioral health issues in hotels.,130,,
704,0.97,6226.587,6232.759,And so that was a short-term adaptation of an existing program.,130,,
705,0.97,6232.759,6243.237,Starting in the late summer as King County was exploring what to do--what best to do with its remaining C.A.R.E.S.,130,,
706,0.97,6243.237,6265.759,"Funding for 2020, there was discussion about the very significant impact of people living unsheltered in Pioneer square and the Cid and--national district and I want to pause and call out.",130,,
707,0.97,6265.759,6303.13,"The leadership of business and residential organizations in both neighborhoods who simultaneously said the conditions that they were confronting in the neighborhoods were viable, problem pack for small businesses and residents vulnerable in--particularly in the Cid, very vulnerable businesses and yet they were not--they were calling forward a response but they were not asking for an Enforcement-Based response and they were not asking for what are often referred to as Sweeps.",130,,
708,0.97,6303.13,6306.166,Just sort of a per se decision that an encampment would be cleared regardless of where people went.,130,,
709,0.97,6306.166,6320.113,They said we want to know that people are going somewhere where there will be securely lodged and we are asking for that.,130,,
710,0.97,6320.113,6354.548,"So when that--particularly businesses and neighborhood organizations and the Cid in the summer wrote to you all and said, we want action but we don't--but we want action that entails people being lodged and cared for, not just swept, dispersed or met with an enforcement response, there was not an immediate sort of option like that to plug into, but as we were in discussion with the county about how to use County C.A.R.E.S.",130,,
711,0.97,6354.548,6370.464,"Funds, the idea of bringing sort of a Co-Lead style response to scale in these neighborhoods that we are asking for such a response came to fruition and that is what became just care.",130,,
712,0.97,6370.464,6374.835,So just care is a short-term C.A.R.E.S.,130,,
713,0.97,6374.835,6377.471,Act funded response presently funded through December 30th with C.A.R.E.S.,130,,
714,0.97,6377.471,6390.317,"Money and then through the end of January with the King County bridge award, just for that one month to see if we can bridge to additional C.A.R.E.S.",130,,
715,0.97,6390.317,6390.55,Funds.,130,,
716,0.97,6390.55,6407.334,"It involves placing people for whom we can provide appropriate support in hotels, in hotels staff by a Multiagency consortium, our Co-Lead program, Asian counseling and referral service and chief Seattle club.",130,,
717,0.97,6407.334,6420.113,"Each of these teams is geared to provide support for a slightly different population and in so doing, we can provide strong quality care for a diverse array of people.",130,,
718,0.97,6420.113,6433.16,We do not have the perfect match for everybody out there and in particular we need an additional provider or partner to work with people with highest Acuity mental health needs.,130,,
719,0.97,6433.16,6444.604,So there are some people that--whom reach is engaging in the field for whom we don't have the right Hotel-Based care response.,130,,
720,0.97,6444.604,6453.513,So these are essentially quasi residential C.A.R.E.S.,130,,
721,0.97,6453.513,6453.814,Strategies.,130,,
722,0.97,6453.814,6458.952,Co-Leads focuses on people with acute substance abuse issues.,130,,
723,0.97,6458.952,6464.457,Acrs is focusing primarily on people with higher acute and mental health issues.,130,,
724,0.97,6464.457,6471.264,And chief Seattle club is focusing on native folks.,130,,
725,0.97,6471.264,6488.014,"So reach is leading the field outreach work and I am describing this just because it has become, particular model that could be in use citywide more broadly.",130,,
726,0.97,6488.014,6513.974,"Reach is identifying, assessing and identifying needs and circumstances of people in the field and on a purely voluntary basis connecting them to these lodging officers R offers, based on their needs and based on the Competencies and skills and capacity of the Hotel-Based service providers.",130,,
727,0.97,6513.974,6529.623,"With those resources, reach has been able to demonstrate something that Chloe often says, which is that it's very Unusualto encounter somebody who is unwilling to accept an appropriate offer of housing or lodging.",130,,
728,0.97,6529.623,6542.135,"So the uptake rate, if you will, in these just care efforts in the two neighborhoods has been extraordinarily high, very few people have declined these offers.",130,,
729,0.97,6542.135,6551.111,"It hasn't been an instant or overnight turnaround, but the absorption level has been very high.",130,,
730,0.97,6551.111,6584.11,"So let me just pause and say partnership work that we have begun to do with the Mayor's office and which Hsd in trying to design a new approach that neither centers on enforcement nor is built on displacement, but is built on voluntary engagement.",130,,
731,0.97,6584.11,6596.723,The Council heard during budget about an agreed framework that the Mayor's office and a consortium of service providers tried to work through as a way to try a new approach in 2021.,130,,
732,0.97,6596.723,6625.385,"And the key principles of that framework I just want to name are to recognize that we have, no matter what, a limited pool of appropriate sort of Covid appropriate sheltering resources to offer, while the city's investments are going to increase that pool.",130,,
733,0.97,6625.385,6631.992,It will still fall far short of the number of people who are living unsheltered in the city.,130,,
734,0.97,6631.992,6645.105,So it becomes a challenge of allocating those scarce sheltering resources in a way that is most Impactful and meets the needs of those with greatest barriers and highest impact in the city.,130,,
735,0.97,6645.105,6654.681,How exactly to do that is the subject of ongoing conversations and I don't think that anybody feels that those conversations are completed.,130,,
736,0.97,6654.681,6659.152,"You know, how to identify where to make those offers.",130,,
737,0.97,6659.152,6678.104,"It then becomes important for everyone to acknowledge that because of that resource scarcity, most people currently living unsheltered will continue to be unsheltered for the near term over the next many months.",130,,
738,0.97,6678.104,6711.438,"So the primary function of outreach is to make that viable, as viable as possible, allowing people to shelter in place as safely and humanly as possible and with--and improving the impacts of that situation on surrounding neighborhoods so really focusing on problem solving, hygiene, sanitation and problem solving, resolving issues without displacement.",130,,
739,0.97,6711.438,6711.971,That's a new framework.,130,,
740,0.97,6711.971,6722.549,"It is--it is one on which there was a value spaced agreement but what it really looks like in implementation is still, I think, to be seen.",130,,
741,0.97,6722.549,6743.403,"I want to name the other partners who participated in framing up that agreement along with reach Evergreen tree services and my office that included the Seattle Club, the urban League, downtown emergency service center and the Seattle/King County coalition on homelessness.",130,,
742,0.97,6743.403,6798.825,"So we continue to meet with the Mayor's office and I think we have been able to sketch out the--sort of the hard decision points that need to be Granled with and in the coming weeks we will make an effort to firm up the framework so that it gets implemented in a way that has legitimacy as well as transparent and accountable and achieves the most that we can with the resources that we have while being real with the public about what--when they are--when there is not an appropriate match to meet the needs of everybody out there, what does that mean about what the plan is going to be and what the role of outreach will be.",130,,
743,0.97,6798.825,6799.259,Thank you.,130,,
744,0.97,6799.259,6800.16,Thank you so much.,131,,
745,0.97,6800.16,6807.634,I have a couple of quick preliminary questions for some panel members and then I want to turn it over to the committee members.,131,,
746,0.97,6807.634,6830.29,"First, I want to thank everybody here for being collaborative, energetic, coming forward with a Problem- solving attitude to engage in this, since we really started talking on a regular basis as a provider community executive branch and legislative body in the fall.",131,,
747,0.97,6830.29,6845.238,"And I think that that in a lot of ways has set up some great success for 2021 and I think, you know, the overview and the presentation really speaks to a lot of the things that are in motion and that are happening on the ground.",131,,
748,0.97,6845.238,6852.278,I wanted to ask a couple of just quick questions from the presentation.,131,,
749,0.97,6852.278,6856.049,The first one from Chloe or anyone else that wants to jump in and address this.,131,,
750,0.97,6856.049,6870.23,"Really appreciate that one of the things that's being grappled with is an approval--improving the referral system, which is a conversation that there's been a lot of back and forth about for years.",131,,
751,0.97,6870.23,6987.013,And I wonder if the panel could maybe dig deeper into what that process has entailed and what the vision is for fine tuning that referral system to make sure that we are making it as seamless as possible to get people appropriately matched and into a lot of these additive transitional shelter assets that we are standing up and for they are distal portion of the represented it out side.,131,,
752,0.97,6987.013,6997.457,And making sure they are.,131,,
753,0.97,6998.658,7003.696,There is a priority discussion and a technical discussion.,131,,
754,0.97,7003.696,7036.629,There will be some rapid was once shelter beds for immediate need that nobody we may slow that down so we have a pool of applicants and continue to make sure that our people are matching our more advanced resources.,131,,
755,0.97,7036.629,7037.163,Does that make sense?,131,,
756,0.97,7037.163,7045.805,I look forward to hearing more about that project as it develops and I'm glad that work is underway and that Y'all are involved in that.,132,,
757,0.97,7045.805,7059.685,Because I think that's a conversation that has been going on a long time and I appreciate it might be getting so I don't actually have any additional follow-up questions from the presentation.,132,,
758,0.97,7059.685,7078.504,"I'd like to open it up more broadly to other Councilmembers, if there's folks here who have a question for any of the panel members.",132,,
759,0.97,7079.272,7079.705,Madam President.,133,,
760,0.97,7079.705,7083.609,"When pressed to ask a question, I'm going to go ahead and do it.",134,,
761,0.97,7083.609,7103.496,"So I think it would be helpful to hear--you know, there's the referral process and I think that, you know, I'm heartened to hear that we are moving towards a direction where we have a better way to do that.",134,,
762,0.97,7103.496,7205.598,"And I think it's--I would be interested in just hearing from either Lisa, Chloe or deputy Mayor Sixkiller, how, in terms of the inventory side of the referral question, right, so what are some opportunities to be able to continue to work on sort of that supply side of the referral equation, right, like what can this--I know that in the past, the service providers have been really concerned about particularly as it related to the navigation team model, the city holding onto what availability was in terms of shelter beds across the city and I think, you know, my hope is that that's now evolving into something that's different and much more Iterative and so wanted to hear from the panel, sort of, again, where the opportunities and ongoing challenges as it relates to not just having a robust referral system but sort of resolving the issues around the supply side of the referral system in terms of, what are the shelter options needed and where do we know the ongoing gaps that the city council needs to continue to Prioritize?",134,,
763,0.97,7205.598,7211.904,"I think that for me, as a citywide representative, I want to make sure we are taking a very geographically equitable perspective on that.",134,,
764,0.97,7211.904,7217.743,Make sure that you reach every impacted corner of the city.,134,,
765,0.97,7217.743,7239.131,"I can start, since we find ourselves on that inventories side of the balance . I think it hasn't--the city has not yet announced who will be staffing the hotel facilities that they will bring Online, and it will matter who that is.",135,,
766,0.97,7239.131,7265.291,"Optimally, we match--Optimally, the outreach teams are doing a really good job of matching individuals to the right care team who can meet their needs and have that go well and have it be a really meaningful next step for that person that set them up well.",135,,
767,0.97,7265.291,7319.311,"An array of different, sort of teams with different skill sets and the right expertise and the right level of's laughing to match the need will allow those outreach referrals . It gives them options, and for greatest impact of this whole undertaking, those matches need to be really good . There has been really heartening discussion from some providers who feel like they are existing facilities may not be being used for optimal impact.",135,,
768,0.97,7319.311,7332.124,Dsc and the navigation center has named that they have Ped people placed their that didn't need a complement of services for Peeper with higher Acuity mental health needs.,135,,
769,0.97,7332.124,7336.829,They are in a position to offer.,135,,
770,0.97,7336.829,7357.083,"You take all the moving parts and look at what we've got, figure out what each partner can do, we can get the most out of the slots or placements that will be available to that team.",135,,
771,0.97,7357.083,7366.258,"It still begs the question of, where are the priority--where will shelter be allocated?",135,,
772,0.97,7366.258,7374.567,Every neighborhood in the city assuredly believes that they are the highest priority place.,135,,
773,0.97,7374.567,7384.076,"Everybody can be right about that, and yet the number will not allow for that offer to be made everywhere.",135,,
774,0.97,7384.076,7401.594,"Intentionality, and I'm not trying to say that anyone of us knows the answer, but clarity about how those decisions are being made and the ability to explain that or shoulder and explain how those decisions are being made will be very important.",135,,
775,0.97,7401.594,7414.807,"I don't think we're quite there yet to be able to name how that decision-making process, the principles on which that decision-making process will run, but we need to be.",135,,
776,0.97,7414.807,7420.045,Everybody needs to be able to understand that.,135,,
777,0.97,7420.045,7450.476,"Counsel and president, maybe I just add basic comments to what Lisa just said . I think a lot of the work that the hope team and contracting partners are working with is trying to improve the backbone of the referral system itself . The city has shelter beds, others shelter beds that are not contracted with the city.",136,,
778,0.97,7450.476,7460.953,It can keep a disjointed view of what shelter availability actually is.,136,,
779,0.97,7460.953,7467.193,"To Lisa's point, what kind of transfer there is.",136,,
780,0.97,7467.193,7485.611,"As we do this work, visibility across the entire shelter network and then also going the next step to make sure that the outreach, the folks on the ground actually doing engagement with individuals experiencing homelessness have that information.",136,,
781,0.97,7485.611,7490.916,"When someone decides they are ready to come in, it is not four days away.",136,,
782,0.97,7490.916,7503.896,"The goal is--and I keep saying, it is like Ticketmaster . You are able to select your seat and know where you are going, if it is enhanced or not.",136,,
783,0.97,7503.896,7514.54,"I'm not trying to be funny, but that level, if I were in outreach provider, I would want to know which tools I have available to bring people inside.",136,,
784,0.97,7514.54,7516.809,I think that is the goal of a lot of this work.,136,,
785,0.97,7516.809,7518.21,How do we do that?,136,,
786,0.97,7518.21,7522.114,How can we do that better?,136,,
787,0.97,7522.114,7536.428,"Technology is part of it, and we are working on that . I also think many of the things that Lisa and Chloe said ring true in terms of what we are navigating you and who we are Prioritizing in that work.",136,,
788,0.97,7536.428,7541.533,"Thank you . does that answer all your questions, Madam President?",137,,
789,0.97,7541.533,7544.436,It does.,138,,
790,0.97,7544.436,7546.238,Councilmember Alice has a question.,138,,
791,0.97,7546.238,7578.37,"Thank you . I guess it's not so much a question . I do want to thank you, Lisa, as you are talking about a framework that I know there has been a lot of conversation about over the last several months now, the idea that the framework is really rooted in neither enforcement nor displacement . I think that is worth repeating.",139,,
792,0.97,7578.37,7605.397,"The way that we have been doing this for a long time is not really serving many people or our community members . I do think it is really important to be realistic about the fact that there are limited shelter spaces right now, particularly for adults . There are many thousands of people who will spend the winter outdoors.",139,,
793,0.97,7605.397,7614.106,"Because we don't have the space . We have additional shelter plans, plans for more permanent, supportive housing.",139,,
794,0.97,7614.106,7616.508,"But right now, those things are not available.",139,,
795,0.97,7616.508,7671.563,"I think it's important that we be straight with our community, with our business community, with our neighbors, that we are in this position, and we are working toward moving out of this situation . When I hear about things that are happening, you know, it is certainly an except double for city workers to feel and safe and feel they can't do their job when they are trying to do regular maintenance in an area . But it is also unacceptable to be moving people when we know that there is not enough places for them to go, that we are going to have people who are going to be living outdoors during the winter.",139,,
796,0.97,7671.563,7692.284,"We are working on getting more space, but we just don't have it right now . I think if we are going to continue to have these conversations and continue to ground what we are trying to do in the notion that the best way to move forward is not to displace and is not to enforce what are basically people trying to survive outdoors.",139,,
797,0.97,7692.284,7709.935,"Then the way we rebuild trust among all of our neighbors is to be straight about what our limitations are and the work that we are working hard to accomplish, but it's going to take a little bit of time . I just want to thank all of you again.",139,,
798,0.97,7709.935,7714.44,This is complex and will take time.,139,,
799,0.97,7714.44,7716.708,I am excited for all of the work that you are doing.,139,,
800,0.97,7716.708,7720.312,I just want to thank you for that.,139,,
801,0.97,7720.312,7722.014,Yeah.,140,,
802,0.97,7722.014,7727.853,I will speak to that.,140,,
803,0.97,7727.853,7751.443,"It wasn't really a question, but I do feel, to the question about the referrals and geography, part of the issue was that people were connected to encampment Removals . I think that we have slowed them down.",140,,
804,0.97,7751.443,7765.057,"It is our obligation to describe the gap of resources every day and what we see outside . We are very happy to do that, in partnership with the city, the Mayor's office.",140,,
805,0.97,7765.057,7766.058,You said it exactly right.,140,,
806,0.97,7766.058,7770.896,"There are not deficient places, particularly single adult men.",140,,
807,0.97,7770.896,7778.971,There are very few available spots . that is the reality for people.,140,,
808,0.97,7778.971,7784.71,Councilmember Herbal.,141,,
809,0.97,7784.71,7804.83,"Along the lines of this important value that we all have in addition to serving the people who are Unfortunately living outdoors, for many years now and now in this crisis as we are about to enter the winter months.",142,,
810,0.97,7804.83,7825.551,"Another important value is to be straight with members of the public who are contacting us about Encampments in their communities, whether or not they are motivated by concern about their on House neighbors or are trying to file a complaint seeking a removal.",142,,
811,0.97,7825.551,7841.633,One of the things I am really interested in is knowing more about how the city ACCEPTS information from Seattle residents about encampment and what response they received.,142,,
812,0.97,7841.633,7899.091,"What information is provided upon making a report to the city that both informs them in a way that accurately explains the scope of the challenge and SETS common expectations for what kind of response and when there might a response . I am just really wanting to understand what hope does with the information it receives from resident suits about Encampments in their communities, how the city Prioritizes with our outreach providers, which locations to respond to, and we heard a little bit about this at the beginning, but I just want to affirm again for the viewing public that outreach is currently happening today.",142,,
813,0.97,7899.091,7909.701,"There is this belief, this continued belief that since the navigation team is not operating, that means that outreach has stopped.",142,,
814,0.97,7909.701,8013.638,"An important component of undoing that thinking is that we have a robust response to people who are making reports of Encampments . again, it explains the scope of the problem it also explains how we are Prioritizing encampment locations for outreach . What that means, some encampment locations will not be Prioritized for outreach . Some will be . We may not have places for people in those locations to go, but it's really important and an opportunity that we have to inform the public about the complexity of this issue, and I also want to just thank everybody for engaging in this conversation over the last several months . I think it's really important to move toward this problem-solving approach that we are working together with our advocacy community, the Mayor's office and the Council .
