54,0.97,283.483,287.987,We've seen a lot of progress in the central district and we don't want to be left behind.,9,,
55,0.97,287.987,296.062,So we put together this organization to help put the awareness out there to people in the community about how to invest their money.,9,,
56,0.97,296.062,304.07,"And also, collaborating with other organizations that are already in that community, working on developments such as Arback.",9,,
57,0.97,304.07,305.972,And a few others.,9,,

60,0.97,320.687,327.026,"And also allowing people in the community to own the community and make their, their, you know, their community their home.",9,,
61,0.97,327.026,331.297,And one way to do that is by Accessing to capital.,9,,
62,0.97,331.297,336.969,"So we put together a plan, and we're hoping to present that to people in the community within the coming months.",9,,
63,0.97,336.969,342.008,And also hope that we can get some support with the city on how to deploy that.,9,,

73,0.97,365.064,386.285,"So bird bar place is a community service organization in the CD that helps to support low-income families am but we're also part of this community work in that we build smaller based community organizations, which we consider civil organizations who are helping to build communities as well.",13,,
74,0.97,386.285,387.72,And Accessing the system.,13,,
75,0.97,387.72,389.756,Shifting systems in order to build community wealth.,13,,
76,0.97,389.756,405.104,"And one of the things that we have discovered as a coalition is that it can be quite challenging, when we interact with city departments several at a time, to do this work.",13,,
77,0.97,405.104,410.243,To understand perspectives on how each Department interprets rules and policies.,13,,
78,0.97,410.243,416.415,"And so for instance, we're dealing with O.H.",13,,
79,0.97,416.415,416.883,"O.E.D., D.C.I.",13,,
80,0.97,416.883,417.884,And Opcd.,13,,
81,0.97,417.884,421.187,And while it's incredible to be interacting with them individually.,13,,
82,0.97,421.187,423.723,There are different ways in this they're interrupting policies.,13,,
83,0.97,423.723,431.23,And it would be useful for our community organizations if they were to do an examination of those policies and get in alignment.,13,,
84,0.97,431.23,438.838,"It would be less costly for us in time and money from the community side, especially as an external Stakeholder.",13,,
85,0.97,438.838,449.715,"One of the things that we have been looking at is how do we fortify our communities in order to build collective, have collective ownerships.",13,,
86,0.97,449.715,451.951,"So our Community-Based organizations, churches.",13,,
87,0.97,451.951,452.518,But also small businesses.,13,,
88,0.97,452.518,456.155,One of the successes we had in our community is Earl's shop.,13,,
89,0.97,456.155,456.389,Right?,13,,
90,0.97,456.389,458.024,He's been around for 28 years.,13,,
91,0.97,458.024,461.06,"He, on the surface, yes, he's a barber shop.",13,,
92,0.97,461.06,465.665,He's an institution in our black community.,13,,
93,0.97,465.665,471.103,"He--the organization itself, his business has formed a fabric in our black community.",13,,
94,0.97,471.103,473.84,And we were creative with O.E.D.,13,,
95,0.97,473.84,476.909,In our community organizations in helping to have that business thrive.,13,,
96,0.97,476.909,491.757,"So we would like to sit down, as community members, community organizations, with those four departments, to talk about the successes we're seeing in community Andsharing that and how we can work together.",13,,
97,0.97,491.757,494.76,What mechanisms can we use like E.D.I.,13,,
98,0.97,494.76,495.628,And working across communities.,13,,
99,0.97,495.628,499.165,We have been working with our neighbors in the Crescent collaborative to make that go.,13,,
100,0.97,499.165,500.433,And we have been successful.,13,,
101,0.97,500.433,503.069,And we want to be able on work with those departments to do that.,13,,
102,0.97,503.069,504.804,Thank you very much.,14,,
103,0.97,504.804,509.275,"Next is Melissa Purcell, followed by David sable.",15,,
104,0.97,509.275,511.11,Hello.,16,,
105,0.97,511.11,512.645,Thanks for having us here today.,17,,
106,0.97,512.645,514.08,It's nice to see you.,17,,
107,0.97,514.08,514.814,Congratulations.,17,,
108,0.97,514.814,517.917,I am--my name is Melissa Purcell.,17,,
109,0.97,517.917,521.153,"I am the business agent for Iatse, local 48.",17,,
110,0.97,521.153,529.428,"We are the film crews that do commercials and web content and films and TV, et cetera.",17,,
111,0.97,529.428,531.464,I'm also part of the film Meusks coalition.,17,,
112,0.97,531.464,534.367,We were in here earlier last year for budgeting.,17,,
113,0.97,534.367,539.472,We understand that there is a reorganization of the office of film and music within the O.E.D.,17,,
114,0.97,539.472,543.809,"And we just want to make sure that in that reorganization, that we are communicated with.",17,,
115,0.97,543.809,545.144,We have been in meetings.,17,,
116,0.97,545.144,547.246,We are being folded into the process now.,17,,
117,0.97,547.246,557.156,"But what's important to us is that the jobs of our industry, the film jobs and economic opportunity have been waning in recent years.",17,,
118,0.97,557.156,576.275,"And we need to make sure we stabilize those things and we support those things, so that as we start Partnering with more and more people, and bringing in more Stakeholders, that we are certain everybody is getting a living wage job from those industries, as well as that in the work force development that is being pinned.",17,,
119,0.97,576.275,577.076,Which is a fantastic thing.,17,,
120,0.97,577.076,580.78,We need to make sure there's an industry for them to get into.,17,,
121,0.97,580.78,586.786,So that we're not just training folks that are going to leave to Portland or Los Angeles.,17,,
122,0.97,586.786,590.623,So I just look to find out more information from arts and O.E.D.,17,,
123,0.97,590.623,590.89,Together.,17,,
124,0.97,590.89,592.992,And how those two are working together.,17,,
125,0.97,592.992,598.497,Because it's still not real clear how arts is working in that reorganization.,17,,
126,0.97,598.497,603.169,We think of it strictly as an economic O.E.D.,17,,
127,0.97,603.169,603.469,Situation.,17,,
128,0.97,603.469,608.574,A sort of For-Profit and nonprofit entities.,17,,
129,0.97,608.574,610.409,And where those various sectors mash together.,17,,
130,0.97,610.409,610.71,Great.,18,,
131,0.97,610.71,611.544,Thank you very much.,18,,

133,0.97,614.714,615.648,And--Curtis Brown.,19,,
134,0.97,615.648,618.384,And then.,19,,
135,0.97,618.384,618.618,Jaguna?,19,,
136,0.97,618.618,620.62,Did I say that right?,19,,
137,0.97,620.62,622.888,Thank you very much.,20,,
138,0.97,622.888,624.523,My name is David Sabee.,20,,
139,0.97,624.523,627.226,I have three hats that I wear.,20,,
140,0.97,627.226,635.134,"I am a labor Organizer from the Guild of Symphony opera and ballet musicians, which is a Seattle-Founded Union.",20,,
141,0.97,635.134,636.902,It's 25 years old.,20,,
142,0.97,636.902,637.503,Founded here.,20,,
143,0.97,637.503,637.87,It's thriving.,20,,
144,0.97,637.87,639.338,It's a wonderful thing.,20,,
145,0.97,639.338,641.64,I'm also a small employer.,20,,
146,0.97,641.64,651.217,And have a company called Seattle music that has basically been involved in the recording of 200 film scores in Seattle.,20,,
147,0.97,651.217,654.954,I'm here as Melissa's counterpart on the music side.,20,,
148,0.97,654.954,664.33,I was part of the initial founding of the music Commission and the document that was generated in 2004 with James Keblis.,20,,
149,0.97,664.33,665.264,And others.,20,,
150,0.97,665.264,669.368,"And also, after that, on the arts Commission for six years.",20,,
151,0.97,669.368,682.214,And I believe that I think that the vitality of the sector can best be served with a vital music Commission that is definitely in the O.E.D.,20,,
152,0.97,682.214,685.951,"Side, that is in the For-Profit side.",20,,
153,0.97,685.951,691.424,"And the arts side, which I value tremendously in my life in the Seattle Symphony.",20,,
154,0.97,691.424,697.396,"And Seattle opera, is--it's a very important for us to maintain the dichotomy.",20,,
155,0.97,697.396,699.832,Because the focuses are totally different.,20,,
156,0.97,699.832,703.102,And I think that's my main point that I would like to put across.,20,,
157,0.97,703.102,703.369,Great.,21,,
158,0.97,703.369,706.105,Thank you very much.,21,,
159,0.97,706.105,707.173,Sorry.,22,,
160,0.97,707.173,712.278,I keep dealing with the glasses.,22,,
161,0.97,712.278,712.511,Curtis.,22,,
162,0.97,712.511,713.179,And then Jaguna?,22,,
163,0.97,713.179,713.813,Hi.,23,,
164,0.97,713.813,715.281,I'm Curtis Brown.,23,,
165,0.97,715.281,715.715,Sorry.,24,,
166,0.97,715.715,715.948,Curtis.,24,,
167,0.97,715.948,719.819,If I could remind you to speak into the Mike so that Seattle channel can capture this.,24,,
168,0.97,719.819,725.057,"This is the first time I've done this, even though I'm a 54- year Seattle resident.",25,,
169,0.97,725.057,731.297,"I'm just here today, along with our group, is just to let you know about Community-Owned real estate and development.",25,,
170,0.97,731.297,733.666,We're taking a different approach.,25,,
171,0.97,733.666,735.234,The Nonprofits have done a great job.,25,,
172,0.97,735.234,742.942,They've done such a great Jobthat their balance sheets are exceptional.,25,,
173,0.97,742.942,746.579,You know I run a nonprofit and my balance sheet is wonderful.,25,,
174,0.97,746.579,749.815,But the balance sheet of our community members is not.,25,,
175,0.97,749.815,756.322,Our goal is to pool the resources of our community members and start to buy up real estate in the area.,25,,
176,0.97,756.322,763.429,The only way to stop Gent Riification is to buy up the real estate and develop it.,25,,
177,0.97,763.429,768.467,"The problem is, the residents in our community, we are not the richest of people.",25,,
178,0.97,768.467,771.137,We are looking at two initiatives.,25,,
179,0.97,771.137,773.239,"One, we're going to create a leveraged Fund.",25,,
180,0.97,773.239,780.88,"One of the problems is, people do not understand that you can actually go out and borrow money to invest.",25,,
181,0.97,780.88,786.785,"We're going to create a leverage Fund, where families can borrow up to 10 times the amount they invest.",25,,
182,0.97,786.785,791.891,And then be able to invest that back into real estate projects in South Seattle.,25,,
183,0.97,791.891,794.426,The second aspect of the initiative is the guarantees.,25,,
184,0.97,794.426,798.197,And the guarantees is a part where this city can play a huge role.,25,,
185,0.97,798.197,804.003,"If we can create guarantees for people's investments, then they're no longer investments.",25,,
186,0.97,804.003,807.072,And you can help us reduce the security law issues.,25,,
187,0.97,807.072,823.222,"So one of the things as city Council, I really want you to focus on how you can create guarantees to our investors, because they're no longer investors, and we can reduce our overhead and cost for capital.",25,,
188,0.97,823.222,825.524,So there's a number of things we're doing.,25,,
189,0.97,825.524,826.258,We're really excited.,25,,
190,0.97,826.258,828.627,And we're surveying the community now.,25,,
191,0.97,828.627,833.465,And we're actually planning have having them start saving investment accounts as early as may and June.,25,,
192,0.97,833.465,838.17,And I'm working really hard now on raising the money for the leverage Fund.,25,,
193,0.97,838.17,839.872,So they can actually borrow from it.,25,,
194,0.97,839.872,848.881,"And again, what I'm hoping to work closely with you on creating some guarantees from the city, so they're not actually called investments.",25,,
195,0.97,848.881,849.949,Thank you.,25,,
196,0.97,849.949,850.282,Great.,26,,
197,0.97,850.282,856.522,"Thank you, Curtis.",26,,
198,0.97,856.522,857.323,Giguna.,27,,
199,0.97,857.323,858.757,Am I saying that right?,27,,
200,0.97,858.757,859.158,Yes.,28,,
201,0.97,859.158,859.592,Thank you.,29,,
202,0.97,859.592,862.995,"We'll be followed by--Solomon, you've already gone.",29,,
203,0.97,862.995,866.599,So Quinn and then Jamil.,29,,
204,0.97,866.599,868.367,Hello.,30,,
205,0.97,868.367,871.971,My name is Jagunna Genchero.,30,,
206,0.97,871.971,873.072,I'm with the African Southwest.,30,,
207,0.97,873.072,881.814,One of the mission system to promote the immigration of local African communities primarily through small business development.,30,,
208,0.97,881.814,886.719,We're very aware of the challenges facing African-Owned businesses in South Seattle.,30,,
209,0.97,886.719,897.83,"A lot of my work is in Southeast Seattle, with African- owned businesses that deal with struggles related to access to capital, capacity building and forces of displacement.",30,,
210,0.97,897.83,902.635,We find there are a lot of programs in Seattle and King County.,30,,
211,0.97,902.635,910.576,"However, there is a challenge getting the knowledge to the owners in our business community to Tailoring the programs so they can participate and take advantage of those programs.",30,,
212,0.97,910.576,912.711,And then to walk them through that process.,30,,
213,0.97,912.711,921.02,So we find that there is increasing need for programs that are innovative in getting access to capital for our communities.,30,,
214,0.97,921.02,936.635,"There's increasing need for the funding to support those in the community who are giving the technical assistance, and building capacity for the community, who are from the community, so that these initiatives that are of great motivation can actually be implemented.",30,,
215,0.97,936.635,939.538,Need a lot of implementation on the ground.,30,,
216,0.97,939.538,940.506,Particularly in Southeast Seattle.,30,,
217,0.97,940.506,947.813,One of the projects I'm involved with is the Multicultural coalition community operations center.,30,,
218,0.97,947.813,949.748,There's a lot of potential to this program.,30,,
219,0.97,949.748,954.186,But the organizations still do need to support the capacity to take full advantage.,30,,
220,0.97,954.186,962.194,"I would encourage the city to work to provide the funding, and also the study of the needs and the barriers facing our communities.",30,,
221,0.97,962.194,964.33,"Because often, there's a gap in terms of the data.",30,,
222,0.97,964.33,970.97,"And the identification of the barriers and what it takes to overcome those barriers so that these programs are, indeed, affected.",30,,
223,0.97,970.97,973.172,But I think the assets are in the community.,30,,
224,0.97,973.172,976.775,"However, the people in the community doing the work need to be supported and Resourced.",30,,
225,0.97,976.775,979.345,So they can do that work effectively.,30,,
226,0.97,979.345,981.246,Great.,31,,
227,0.97,981.246,988.554,Thank you very much.,31,,
228,0.97,988.554,995.761,Quinn Fum.,32,,
229,0.97,995.761,996.195,Good evening.,33,,
230,0.97,996.195,997.496,My name is Quin Fam.,33,,
231,0.97,997.496,1000.466,I'm with the friends of little Saigon.,33,,
232,0.97,1000.466,1003.736,I'm also on the Edi advisory committee.,33,,
233,0.97,1003.736,1008.107,I'm here to just really talk about how E.D.I.,33,,
234,0.97,1008.107,1009.908,Has been a great program.,33,,
235,0.97,1009.908,1013.011,And the little Saigon project.,33,,
236,0.97,1013.011,1016.749,"A Community-Driven, mixed use community project is supported through that.",33,,
237,0.97,1016.749,1021.42,"Although it's a great program, the current amount of funding is not enough.",33,,
238,0.97,1021.42,1023.689,It's not enough to fund current projects.,33,,
239,0.97,1023.689,1025.691,And it's not enough to fund future projects.,33,,
240,0.97,1025.691,1038.804,"So I urge you to think about opportunities to increase that source so that we can provide support for future projects, within the community as well as fulfill projects that are in the pipeline.",33,,
241,0.97,1038.804,1040.372,$5 million right now.,33,,
242,0.97,1040.372,1042.708,That can hardly fund one project.,33,,
243,0.97,1042.708,1047.713,So having over 20 projects on the E.D.I.,33,,
244,0.97,1047.713,1048.147,Pipeline.,33,,
245,0.97,1048.147,1057.956,It right now looks somewhat impossible for our community to fulfill any of the dreams we have in the neighborhoods we want to support.,33,,
246,0.97,1057.956,1059.224,And in addition.,34,,
247,0.97,1059.224,1060.793,This was mentioned earlier.,34,,
248,0.97,1060.793,1064.063,There should be better collaboration amongst different departments.,34,,
249,0.97,1064.063,1067.566,When you're working on a Mixed- Ous project.,34,,
250,0.97,1067.566,1070.602,Working with office of housing.,34,,
251,0.97,1070.602,1075.14,"E.D.I., Opcd.",34,,
252,0.97,1075.14,1079.578,"Opcd, all the departments.",34,,
253,0.97,1079.578,1080.012,Too many Acronyms.,34,,
254,0.97,1080.012,1084.483,I'm going to skip them all.,34,,
255,0.97,1084.483,1085.317,But Sdci particularly as well.,34,,
256,0.97,1085.317,1086.785,There is a lot of process.,34,,
257,0.97,1086.785,1090.689,And a lot of strenuous time that community members are investing in.,34,,
258,0.97,1090.689,1095.761,And that takes away from what they are currently doing within their own programs.,34,,
259,0.97,1095.761,1097.963,And to fulfill their projects.,34,,
260,0.97,1097.963,1104.603,"So not only do we ask for better collaboration amongst the departments, but better streamline of processes.",34,,
261,0.97,1104.603,1110.542,So that our projects are Prioritized and put through the pipeline much more quickly.,34,,
262,0.97,1110.542,1113.045,Over maybe like a private project.,34,,
263,0.97,1113.045,1117.916,Or a project that is not community driven.,34,,
264,0.97,1117.916,1123.021,And Lastly.,34,,
265,0.97,1123.021,1129.161,"These projects combined both housing, commercial and community uses.",34,,
266,0.97,1129.161,1137.769,And so there should be opportunities to further support opportunities for ownership within the community.,34,,
267,0.97,1137.769,1141.607,"Such as lease to own models, or commercial condos.",34,,
268,0.97,1141.607,1146.011,Or master leases by Nonprofits that have a mission to fulfill community visions.,34,,
269,0.97,1146.011,1147.212,Thank you.,34,,
270,0.97,1147.212,1147.479,Great.,35,,
271,0.97,1147.479,1149.248,Thanks very much.,35,,
272,0.97,1149.248,1153.352,And Jamil Suleman?,36,,
273,0.97,1153.352,1158.924,"Is going to be our last Speaker, unless there's anybody else who wants to sign up.",36,,
274,0.97,1158.924,1159.091,Oh.,36,,
275,0.97,1159.091,1162.127,"Can you--Lakeisha, can you help them please?",36,,
276,0.97,1162.127,1165.731,Thanks.,36,,
277,0.97,1165.731,1166.164,"Go ahead, Jamil.",36,,
278,0.97,1166.164,1166.965,Thank you.,37,,
279,0.97,1166.965,1171.737,I will be speaking at the end panel about film.,37,,
280,0.97,1171.737,1173.739,But what I would like to say.,37,,
281,0.97,1173.739,1177.976,So my name is Jamil Suleman.,37,,
282,0.97,1177.976,1182.114,"I'm a Filmmaker, performer, writer here in Washington.",37,,
283,0.97,1182.114,1183.782,I'm based in South Seattle.,37,,
284,0.97,1183.782,1187.085,And I own a film company called Indy genius media.,37,,
285,0.97,1187.085,1199.665,"And we've done a lot of content for the city, for the Mayor, Mayor's office, Seattle music Commission, South Seattle Emerald, local publications, Nonprofits, Galas, and things of than nature.",37,,
286,0.97,1199.665,1201.767,We're a young film company in Seattle.,37,,
287,0.97,1201.767,1214.279,"We know a lot of young Filmmakers in South Seattle, mostly Filmmakers of color, who are not attached to any kind of Union or anything like that.",37,,
288,0.97,1214.279,1221.82,And don't have any connection to these industry jobs that are kind of being spoken about earlier.,37,,
289,0.97,1221.82,1235.701,"So what I'm really here to do, as kind of a new person in that industry is to advocate for our voice, to be, you know, kind of put up front in a lot of ways.",37,,
290,0.97,1235.701,1238.003,We hold those narratives that are really important.,37,,
291,0.97,1238.003,1241.64,And we're trying to help change the narrative.,37,,
292,0.97,1241.64,1244.242,"But if we're not heard, we won't be able to do that.",37,,
293,0.97,1244.242,1246.712,So there is money coming in for film and music.,37,,
294,0.97,1246.712,1248.914,And for film and television in this city.,37,,
295,0.97,1248.914,1258.957,"And we'd like to see the support for communities of color, particularly in our voices and our narratives.",37,,
296,0.97,1258.957,1267.633,And my company is one of the very few Omwbe certified businesses making us a minority business.,37,,
297,0.97,1267.633,1271.069,"So when other businesses can subcontract out, we check a box for them.",37,,
298,0.97,1271.069,1274.64,So they're able to kind of get that quota filled.,37,,
299,0.97,1274.64,1278.043,A lot of young Filmmakers of color don't know about that.,37,,
300,0.97,1278.043,1285.317,"We need some kind of structure to help folks bridge the gap, get into the industry, and to support Filmmaking, particularly in South Seattle.",37,,
301,0.97,1285.317,1286.184,So thank you.,37,,
302,0.97,1286.184,1287.886,Thanks very much.,38,,
303,0.97,1287.886,1288.654,Okay.,39,,
304,0.97,1288.654,1292.19,We have two more speakers.,39,,
305,0.97,1292.19,1297.095,Patricia Allen and mark Jones.,39,,
306,0.97,1297.095,1298.697,Hi.,40,,
307,0.97,1298.697,1300.298,Good evening.,40,,
308,0.97,1300.298,1300.766,I'm Patricia Allen.,40,,
309,0.97,1300.766,1302.701,I work Seattle club.,40,,
310,0.97,1302.701,1310.108,"And I oversee the national coalition to end urban Indiginous homelessness, which we're launching this week, which I'm really excited about.",40,,
311,0.97,1310.108,1319.317,"I also work with the native works program, which is a Microentrepreneurship program and two Seattle clubs organization.",40,,
312,0.97,1319.317,1326.124,I'd say something that is very important for us is that Intersectionality between sovereignty and identity.,40,,
313,0.97,1326.124,1332.731,And something that is a little difficult for a lot.,40,,
314,0.97,1332.731,1339.438,"Úgrass roots organizers and tribal communities is understanding, having a very clear definition of sovereignty.",40,,
315,0.97,1339.438,1341.673,In terms of what land we're on.,40,,
316,0.97,1341.673,1349.314,But also who are the right advocates to speak on behalf of the community.,40,,
317,0.97,1349.314,1360.926,"So when we have art taking place in public places, as well as we have ground blessings or any types of events where we're inviting tribal communities.",40,,
318,0.97,1360.926,1364.029,Sometimes we end up getting very Tokennized.,40,,
319,0.97,1364.029,1368.834,"Like Oh, this person is the Speaker of all tribes or of all nations and region.",40,,
320,0.97,1368.834,1379.811,"So it's very important to have accountability to check in, not just with tribal leaders but Elders and community that we trust.",40,,
321,0.97,1379.811,1384.149,Because many times people are really exercised beyond their capacity.,40,,
322,0.97,1384.149,1390.789,As well as sometimes the people who are speaking might not necessarily have that consent from the whole Comunity.,40,,
323,0.97,1390.789,1405.737,"For us, it's really important to empower them, as well as really be able to value the worth of the artist that are putting a lot of dedication and art.",40,,
324,0.97,1405.737,1409.441,"And really, Microentrepreneurship is something we're working really diligently on.",40,,
325,0.97,1409.441,1414.88,So acknowledging kind of those little complex layers within our community and our identity.,40,,
326,0.97,1414.88,1415.447,Thank you.,40,,
327,0.97,1415.447,1416.181,Thank you.,41,,
328,0.97,1416.181,1423.755,And mark Jones is the last Speaker we have.,42,,
329,0.97,1430.061,1430.328,Hi.,43,,
330,0.97,1430.328,1430.729,I'm mark Jones.,43,,
331,0.97,1430.729,1433.732,I've been working with some of the people in this room.,43,,
332,0.97,1433.732,1436.802,"Obviously, I sat by Curtis.",43,,
333,0.97,1436.802,1438.537,So that's a hint.,43,,
334,0.97,1438.537,1446.178,And one of the things I've been paying attention to for a number of years and particularly focused on the last few.,43,,
335,0.97,1446.178,1450.682,Is that we have a lot of technical help.,43,,
336,0.97,1450.682,1455.32,Technical solutions.,43,,
337,0.97,1455.32,1460.325,And I'll use Reverend Martin Luther King's term.,43,,
338,0.97,1460.325,1465.897,What we don't have necessarily present in our communities is beloved community.,43,,
339,0.97,1465.897,1466.164,You know.,43,,
340,0.97,1466.164,1470.735,So he talks about in the aftermath of.,43,,
341,0.97,1470.735,1470.969,Right?,43,,
342,0.97,1470.969,1473.972,The violence.,43,,
343,0.97,1473.972,1474.539,Right?,43,,
344,0.97,1474.539,1483.949,So the thing that I've been paying attention to in our work together is what are the principles?,43,,
345,0.97,1483.949,1484.983,What are the behaviors?,43,,
346,0.97,1484.983,1492.457,"What is the education, the training, the awareness, that allows us to live well together.",43,,
347,0.97,1492.457,1496.394,"And therefore, we can begin to thrive?",43,,
348,0.97,1496.394,1505.503,So I look at some of the--some of the affordable housing things we've done.,43,,
349,0.97,1505.503,1508.473,The--it hasn't necessarily solved the problem.,43,,
350,0.97,1508.473,1514.312,And the capacity for people to actually thrive has not increased.,43,,
351,0.97,1514.312,1523.622,And my research and my understanding is that people thrive when they understand how to be together.,43,,
352,0.97,1523.622,1523.989,Uh-huh.,44,,
353,0.97,1523.989,1535.6,"So, there's--I haven't been able to find in the city yet a place that is like ""I get it ."" right?",45,,
354,0.97,1535.6,1544.843,"So this is like my first Outing to you, to say if we can work the relational and cultural with these technical solutions, we will succeed.",45,,
355,0.97,1544.843,1545.343,So that's it.,45,,
356,0.97,1545.343,1545.844,That's great.,46,,
357,0.97,1545.844,1547.178,Thank you very much.,46,,
358,0.97,1547.178,1548.146,I appreciate that.,46,,
359,0.97,1548.146,1554.252,And thanks to everybody who came up to speak.,47,,
360,0.97,1554.252,1554.553,Sorry.,47,,
361,0.97,1554.553,1555.887,Let me get to my script.,47,,
362,0.97,1555.887,1558.256,What's next?,47,,
363,0.97,1558.256,1560.058,Okay.,47,,
364,0.97,1560.058,1565.03,Thank you.,47,,
365,0.97,1565.03,1567.265,So I will conclude public comment.,47,,
366,0.97,1567.265,1569.968,And we will now move onto our items of business.,47,,
367,0.97,1569.968,1577.075,"For the rest of the night, we're going to hear from, as I said, community members and small businesses in three different round tables.",47,,
368,0.97,1577.075,1585.283,"So first, we'll hear from folks who are participating or trying to participate in the equitable development initiative.",47,,
369,0.97,1585.283,1589.688,"Followed by small businesses, followed by arts and film.",47,,

374,0.97,1605.47,1611.276,Or do you just want to say what the business--okay.,48,,

382,0.97,1630.395,1636.634,"So I would like to start, if everyone could just introduce yourselves, the organization you're with.",51,,
383,0.97,1636.634,1646.845,"And to begin the discussion, if we--if you wouldn't mind sharing one thing that has worked with the city, one success, something that you think has worked well.",51,,
384,0.97,1646.845,1652.484,And then we'll have the conversation about how--what else we're going to be doing.,51,,
385,0.97,1652.484,1653.718,Shall I begin?,52,,
386,0.97,1653.718,1655.253,Sure.,53,,
387,0.97,1655.253,1656.254,I'm Dr. Perkins.,54,,

391,0.97,1665.764,1667.732,We recently received the E.D.I.,54,,
392,0.97,1667.732,1668.266,Grant.,54,,
393,0.97,1668.266,1675.84,"Which was a blessing to purchase the adjoining property, in order to expand the parking lot and make the safe Street safer.",54,,
394,0.97,1675.84,1679.477,"But I also like to say before I begin that, to your comment.",54,,
395,0.97,1679.477,1682.28,You all really are doing a great job.,54,,
396,0.97,1682.28,1685.917,"The city, council people in Úseattle, Mayor Jenny Durkan.",54,,
397,0.97,1685.917,1688.753,You're dealing with a complex variable.,54,,
398,0.97,1688.753,1689.387,It's called human behavior.,54,,
399,0.97,1689.387,1691.156,That is the most difficult behavior to change.,54,,
400,0.97,1691.156,1694.325,"But I have to say, the city has stepped up to the plate.",54,,
401,0.97,1694.325,1700.098,And you all should be applauded for the efforts that you have succeeded.,54,,
402,0.97,1700.098,1703.601,"The equity development initiative that started about two years ago, is a success.",54,,
403,0.97,1703.601,1709.741,It has made the visions of Dreamers like Mr. Wyking come true.,54,,
404,0.97,1709.741,1714.212,He has believed in his vision for years.,54,,
405,0.97,1714.212,1718.183,And I applaud him and his steadfastness to make it come true.,54,,
406,0.97,1718.183,1721.786,I think the city can continue these initiatives with economic development.,54,,
407,0.97,1721.786,1722.721,This is a growth area.,54,,
408,0.97,1722.721,1727.926,It's going to continue to be that way with the Viaduct being torn down.,54,,
409,0.97,1727.926,1732.597,It has to be new growth and economic opportunities in West Seattle.,54,,
410,0.97,1732.597,1733.965,And all other cities.,54,,
411,0.97,1733.965,1736.301,There must be inclusion.,54,,
412,0.97,1736.301,1741.339,"So with having said that, and thank you all for the great work that you are doing.",54,,
413,0.97,1741.339,1745.41,We received that grant Popurchase the property next door.,54,,
414,0.97,1745.41,1750.448,And we're in the process of securing it to tear down the house and expand the parking lot.,54,,
415,0.97,1750.448,1756.054,"It's a safe Street initiative to make West Seattle, West marginal way, a safer highway.",54,,
416,0.97,1756.054,1759.324,It is a very dangerous highway to try and cross.,54,,
417,0.97,1759.324,1760.725,Through our city Councilmembers.,54,,
418,0.97,1760.725,1764.162,We were able to get a line item in the Mayor's budget.,54,,
419,0.97,1764.162,1766.965,In order to get -Dot to start the feasibility study.,54,,
420,0.97,1766.965,1769.567,And -Dot is working on it.,54,,
421,0.97,1769.567,1775.073,S-Dot has already made tremendous changes by merging the lanes into two.,54,,
422,0.97,1775.073,1777.675,You know what I'm saying because you've been there.,54,,
423,0.97,1777.675,1779.177,"Now, it's getting safer.",54,,
424,0.97,1779.177,1781.946,So it's a work in progress.,54,,
425,0.97,1781.946,1786.651,And I appreciate the city for setting up the E.D.I.,54,,
426,0.97,1786.651,1786.951,Initiative.,54,,
427,0.97,1786.951,1792.557,And I know there's many good things that are going to come as we all continue to work together.,54,,
428,0.97,1792.557,1793.858,Thank you.,55,,
429,0.97,1793.858,1797.095,"Yes, Ma'am.",56,,

433,0.97,1805.17,1823.388,Thank you for the invitation to come and continue to add to this conversation around how Seattle can be a place where the rhetoric is made reality.,57,,
434,0.97,1823.388,1824.422,You know.,57,,
435,0.97,1824.422,1829.627,We hear a lot about share prosperity.,57,,
436,0.97,1829.627,1830.695,Raising social justice.,57,,
437,0.97,1830.695,1831.629,Equitable development.,57,,
438,0.97,1831.629,1842.941,"And you know, by the numbers, we see a lot of things still going in the opposite direction.",57,,
439,0.97,1842.941,1863.561,"With that said, I think that the city played an instrumental role in making the liberty Bank project happen as one that showed that another path is possible.",57,,
440,0.97,1863.561,1879.777,"Bringing people back, and keeping people in the community that we're vulnerable to displacement, due to the high cost of rent and also for the businesses that were mentioned earlier.",57,,
441,0.97,1879.777,1891.789,"Again, that's a lot of work to still be done around actually getting ownership into the community of it.",57,,
442,0.97,1891.789,1895.693,By Community-Based organizations.,57,,
443,0.97,1895.693,1899.364,And I think that the E.D.I.,57,,
444,0.97,1899.364,1906.004,"Is also a step in the right direction, as was said earlier.",57,,
445,0.97,1906.004,1910.074,The pool is not at a size to meet the need.,57,,
446,0.97,1910.074,1914.078,But there's a motto there that can be scaled out.,57,,
447,0.97,1914.078,1928.226,So I think that a city has been played a role in establishing some models that we now need to scale to meet the demand in the community.,57,,
448,0.97,1928.226,1931.796,Thank you.,58,,
449,0.97,1931.796,1932.03,Derek?,58,,
450,0.97,1932.03,1932.73,Hello.,59,,
451,0.97,1932.73,1937.135,"My name is Derek Lum, interim CDA policy analyst.",59,,
452,0.97,1937.135,1952.75,So I really appreciate being invited here today to talk about community development and so one thing that has gone well is that none of our housing developments would have happened without the city's support.,59,,
453,0.97,1952.75,1960.024,And so we do appreciate the city for supporting us building affordable housing in our community.,59,,
454,0.97,1960.024,1963.461,We also appreciate the existence of the E.D.I.,59,,
455,0.97,1963.461,1963.895,Fund.,59,,
456,0.97,1963.895,1966.23,It's very good for our communities.,59,,
457,0.97,1966.23,1973.838,"However, as others have said, like there's not enough to go around and meet the true need in the communities.",59,,
458,0.97,1973.838,1976.074,But we appreciate the work that city does.,59,,
459,0.97,1976.074,1982.747,And we hope to see it expanded and continued.,59,,
460,0.97,1982.747,1983.014,Great.,60,,
461,0.97,1983.014,1984.248,Thank you.,60,,
462,0.97,1984.248,1989.921,This is really intended to be an open discussion about what you feel is working and what we could be doing better.,60,,
463,0.97,1989.921,2002.033,So I'll just ask a couple of open-ended questions.,60,,
464,0.97,2002.033,2007.171,I'll start by Bying what challenge do you think the economic development is trying to solve?,60,,
465,0.97,2007.171,2007.805,Is it working?,60,,
466,0.97,2007.805,2010.174,What are some other issues coming up?,60,,
467,0.97,2010.174,2018.95,"Clearly the lack of funding to meet the need is one issue but you know, what are we trying to solve with this program?",60,,
468,0.97,2018.95,2034.699,"And what else can the city do to support community organizations who are trying to own their own land, who are trying to have over this capacity.",60,,
469,0.97,2034.699,2037.035,We've had several talking about the need.,60,,
470,0.97,2037.035,2037.602,And development assistance.,60,,
471,0.97,2037.602,2045.042,What would it take to Makesure that our community members have the capacity to do this work well?,60,,
472,0.97,2045.042,2052.316,I would like to comment on a reality that just recently occurred.,61,,
473,0.97,2052.316,2054.052,About a year ago.,61,,
474,0.97,2054.052,2065.063,"As I was pursuing the research in West Seattle, one of the huge gaps that I noticed was lack of transportation.",61,,
475,0.97,2065.063,2068.566,Public transportation to the Duwamish cultural center.,61,,
476,0.97,2068.566,2069.867,Safe public transportation.,61,,
477,0.97,2069.867,2072.97,"Currently, there is none.",61,,
478,0.97,2072.97,2076.741,We did--we captured near accidents.,61,,
479,0.97,2076.741,2079.911,From people trying to walk from a mile and a half one way.,61,,
480,0.97,2079.911,2083.114,And a mile and a half in the opposite direction.,61,,
481,0.97,2083.114,2086.217,Whether from Highland Avenue or under the West Seattle bridge.,61,,
482,0.97,2086.217,2088.152,It's dangerous.,61,,
483,0.97,2088.152,2092.69,Mayor Jenny Durkan has set up the RAD 2 pilot program.,61,,
484,0.97,2092.69,2097.495,"And it was discontinued recently, even though it was doing really well.",61,,
485,0.97,2097.495,2108.005,"So right now, it's back to the status quo, that there's no public transportation, no say way to get to the Duwamish house.",61,,
486,0.97,2108.005,2118.816,"And as long as there is no public transportation, the tribe cannot compete or participate, they are not participating in the economic boom that is going to continue with the tourism industry.",61,,
487,0.97,2118.816,2122.386,"The RAD 2 Van, you could catch the water taxi.",61,,
488,0.97,2122.386,2124.088,Which I demonstrated it several times.,61,,
489,0.97,2124.088,2127.425,But other people as well.,61,,
490,0.97,2127.425,2130.194,From Coleman dock to Secrest park.,61,,
491,0.97,2130.194,2132.13,Then RAD 2 was there.,61,,
492,0.97,2132.13,2133.664,You can call and Reserve it.,61,,
493,0.97,2133.664,2135.933,It took people to their homes.,61,,
494,0.97,2135.933,2137.235,To the Lone house.,61,,
495,0.97,2137.235,2139.67,At the same cost of the Metro fair.,61,,
496,0.97,2139.67,2147.712,"There's another bus that is running, the waterfront bus that is basically funded by Westdot.",61,,
497,0.97,2147.712,2149.046,It's a State-Funded entity.,61,,
498,0.97,2149.046,2152.917,But it does not include the Duwamish loan house.,61,,
499,0.97,2152.917,2155.152,Which is also a mismatch.,61,,
500,0.97,2155.152,2156.721,A gap in terms of equity.,61,,
501,0.97,2156.721,2161.792,"In terms of people getting there to spend their money, like they do with others around the city.",61,,
502,0.97,2161.792,2165.663,You can get on any bus.,61,,
503,0.97,2165.663,2167.064,Or sometimes walking Seattle.,61,,
504,0.97,2167.064,2168.432,One to the other.,61,,
505,0.97,2168.432,2180.177,"But without public transportation to and from, safe public transportation, it creates an economic disparage between the natives in Seattle.",61,,
506,0.97,2180.177,2182.547,When I was working with the architect.,61,,
507,0.97,2182.547,2185.95,We did a tour.,61,,
508,0.97,2185.95,2188.219,There are actually Glacial erratic rocks.,61,,
509,0.97,2188.219,2194.725,"Stuff that he pointed out, evidence that they have been here for over 10,000 years.",61,,
510,0.97,2194.725,2196.894,The T107 project proved it.,61,,
511,0.97,2196.894,2201.199,But it's dangerous trying to cross that street from one side to the other.,61,,
512,0.97,2201.199,2208.873,We just had a drone made on the Website.,61,,
513,0.97,2208.873,2209.407,The Duwamish Tribe.Org.,61,,
514,0.97,2209.407,2209.874,Look under support.,61,,
515,0.97,2209.874,2212.51,And then go down to advocacy.,61,,
516,0.97,2212.51,2213.21,You'll see two drones.,61,,
517,0.97,2213.21,2217.415,One is a before.,61,,
518,0.97,2217.415,2219.483,S-Dot got envelope involved in the others.,61,,
519,0.97,2219.483,2221.485,And the other is progress that is being made.,61,,
520,0.97,2221.485,2223.654,It is a progress that must continue.,61,,
521,0.97,2223.654,2225.59,If people are going to feel safe.,61,,
522,0.97,2225.59,2229.293,S-Dot has merged a Lane where not even a school Buzz can park in front of the house.,61,,
523,0.97,2229.293,2230.428,It's a good start.,61,,
524,0.97,2230.428,2231.429,Nobody is putting nobody down.,61,,
525,0.97,2231.429,2236.734,But we have to lock at the need for transportation and get that Van service back.,61,,
526,0.97,2236.734,2247.178,"Or get the waterfront, West DOT funded state project involved in getting involved like it goes to every other place in Seattle.",61,,
527,0.97,2247.178,2249.647,And that will help to close the gap.,61,,
528,0.97,2249.647,2250.147,Thank you.,62,,
529,0.97,2250.147,2250.381,Yeah.,62,,
530,0.97,2250.381,2250.781,That's important.,62,,
531,0.97,2250.781,2252.55,Just making sure all of these systems are connected.,62,,
532,0.97,2252.55,2260.091,"And as we're talking about how we build up a neighbor, hood.",62,,
533,0.97,2260.091,2264.562,Making sure people can get to Te neighborhood is going to be a critical BART of that.,62,,
534,0.97,2264.562,2264.895,Thank you.,62,,
535,0.97,2264.895,2265.262,"Yes, Ma'am.",63,,
536,0.97,2265.262,2269.266,Either of you want to talk about what you think E.D.I.,64,,
537,0.97,2269.266,2272.837,Is intended to solve--what's the development challenge.,64,,
538,0.97,2272.837,2279.076,And is it how it helped you get through that challenge?,64,,
539,0.97,2279.076,2284.148,As a member of the racial social equity task force.,65,,
540,0.97,2284.148,2293.457,"Which is a collection between multiple communities, essential district, Chinatown, in Southeast Seattle.",65,,
541,0.97,2293.457,2293.958,E.D.I.,65,,
542,0.97,2293.958,2321.352,"Was initially intended to address the effects, compounding effects, residual effects of past government and private sector policies and practices that Disenfranchise certain communities and populations.",65,,
543,0.97,2321.352,2327.625,"So definitely the central district, Red-Lining and the black community was a part of that.",65,,
544,0.97,2327.625,2328.893,Hb1918 recently.,65,,
545,0.97,2328.893,2333.331,That was the last session in the state Legislature.,65,,
546,0.97,2333.331,2333.664,Identified.,65,,
547,0.97,2333.664,2348.245,"And documented that capital projects, you know, government capital projects have negatively impacted, you know, our communities and this is a national phenomenon.",65,,
548,0.97,2348.245,2349.98,One of--a couple of issues.,65,,
549,0.97,2349.98,2351.716,So that's what it was intended to do.,65,,
550,0.97,2351.716,2363.26,"I think that's to help with acquisition of property, to address the commercial space Buildout because that's not supported by the office of housing funds.",65,,
551,0.97,2363.26,2371.268,I think that is being leveraged for both of those uses in the finite amount that it can.,65,,
552,0.97,2371.268,2376.173,A couple of issues that have been challenges with the city.,65,,
553,0.97,2376.173,2381.946,One is that the city is--someone spoke to it earlier.,65,,
554,0.97,2381.946,2412.777,"Fragmented in its departmental approaches and presence in the community, which causes people a lot of problems the city, when the city steps in to respond to a Community- based issue or raised issue or initiative, then it begins to take on a Top-Down approach that is disconnected, sometimes for example, there was just a meeting, I think, impact 2020.",65,,
555,0.97,2412.777,2422.82,"At Langston Hughes that was organized by the Department and neighborhood, to look at the impacts, I guess of displacement and things of that nature.",65,,
556,0.97,2422.82,2424.355,To start a conversation about it.,65,,
557,0.97,2424.355,2425.322,This started a long time ago.,65,,
558,0.97,2425.322,2428.159,And we're already in the action phase.,65,,
559,0.97,2428.159,2433.33,So now is the Department of neighborhoods taking the lead on dress addressing these?,65,,
560,0.97,2433.33,2435.766,And there was three other events happening the same day.,65,,
561,0.97,2435.766,2441.338,So that is one issue.,65,,
562,0.97,2441.338,2443.44,Department developmental team.,65,,
563,0.97,2443.44,2443.841,Between O.E.D.,65,,
564,0.97,2443.841,2445.376,"Neighborhoods, Artses and culture.",65,,
565,0.97,2445.376,2445.943,And Whoever else.,65,,
566,0.97,2445.943,2449.947,And I don't know how that broke up.,65,,
567,0.97,2449.947,2454.685,"But again, that becomes a problem for the community.",65,,
568,0.97,2454.685,2456.253,Because it just breaks up.,65,,
569,0.97,2456.253,2459.79,And they start putting funding in certain places.,65,,
570,0.97,2459.79,2461.425,And it Disorganizes certain initiatives.,65,,
571,0.97,2461.425,2464.461,And I don't know if that's intentional or not.,65,,
572,0.97,2464.461,2467.865,But that's been problematic.,65,,
573,0.97,2467.865,2474.772,"Also, the passing of the Upzoning, without a robust mitigation strategy.",65,,
574,0.97,2474.772,2478.642,"So now, our community with historically a very high ownership community.",65,,
575,0.97,2478.642,2485.616,"And now it's being replaced with, you know, strictly just rentals and affordable housing like liberty bank.",65,,
576,0.97,2485.616,2499.53,"And people that own property are being--are having taxes raised and as the zoning value, you know, the Upzone increased the value of property.",65,,
577,0.97,2499.53,2501.966,And they're on fixed incomes.,65,,
578,0.97,2501.966,2502.7,Not only that.,65,,
579,0.97,2502.7,2504.468,There is still Redlining in the community.,65,,
580,0.97,2504.468,2511.609,Because our community is not allowed access to capital Toactually Redevelop.,65,,
581,0.97,2511.609,2513.878,The only one is through selling it.,65,,
582,0.97,2513.878,2514.111,Right?,65,,
583,0.97,2514.111,2525.055,"And then someone else actually comes in and captures more value by putting, you know, 4 or 5 of the new units that sell at $800,000, where the community members can't afford.",65,,
584,0.97,2525.055,2533.831,"So the only way the communities allowed to come back, people with roots, primarily is through subsidized housing.",65,,
585,0.97,2533.831,2536.534,So that's an equity issue.,65,,
586,0.97,2536.534,2537.234,So the disparity.,65,,
587,0.97,2537.234,2540.004,The wealth gap is continuing.,65,,
588,0.97,2540.004,2550.814,"So whatever black population you may have in 10 years at this Transactory, would--trajectory, would all be limited to affordable subsidized housing projects.",65,,
589,0.97,2550.814,2558.222,"I think another thing is the Mft and holler, for the multifamily tax exemption.",65,,
590,0.97,2558.222,2563.627,And the holler affordable units are really not affordable to most people.,65,,
591,0.97,2563.627,2578.576,So that needs to be I think changed because you have projects like the Vulcan project on 23rd and Jackson.,65,,
592,0.97,2578.576,2580.444,At $1200 for a studio.,65,,
593,0.97,2580.444,2587.051,"And $2400 for like a two or three bedroom, which is not affordable on most people.",65,,
594,0.97,2587.051,2589.486,For somebody making $15 an hour.,66,,
595,0.97,2589.486,2589.954,Exactly.,67,,
596,0.97,2589.954,2600.664,So those are a couple key issues that I think need to be addressed and can be addressed at the policy level.,67,,
597,0.97,2600.664,2609.907,So more robust mitigation strategy for existing property owners to have access to Redeveloping or keeping their property.,67,,
598,0.97,2609.907,2612.91,Stronger on Mft or holler.,67,,
599,0.97,2612.91,2617.481,Which is Incentivizing private developers to build what is still not affordable to a lot of people.,67,,
600,0.97,2617.481,2618.582,Thank you.,68,,
601,0.97,2618.582,2625.389,"Before I go to you, Derek, I do want to acknowledge that Councilmember Herbold is here.",69,,
602,0.97,2625.389,2625.889,Thank you.,69,,
603,0.97,2625.889,2627.625,So I'd love to hear from you.,69,,
604,0.97,2627.625,2630.995,And I do have a question about community ownership of land.,69,,
605,0.97,2630.995,2633.964,That's something we've heard over and over again already.,69,,
606,0.97,2633.964,2634.732,"So go ahead, Derek.",69,,
607,0.97,2634.732,2634.999,Yeah.,70,,
608,0.97,2634.999,2640.337,"And I would like to echo similar points to you, Wyking.",70,,
609,0.97,2640.337,2646.377,So a major issue that interim and other people in our people face is we try to buy land.,70,,
610,0.97,2646.377,2647.845,And then we get outbid.,70,,
611,0.97,2647.845,2656.02,"We just don't have the capital to challenge a private developer who can put, you know, when we have $5 million, they have $10 million.",70,,
612,0.97,2656.02,2656.353,Yep.,71,,
613,0.97,2656.353,2659.356,"And then a lot of times, like we can't do it.",72,,
614,0.97,2659.356,2668.565,And so we need help to be able to purchase and compete with these guys.,72,,
615,0.97,2668.565,2673.57,Another big issue is along the lines that Wyking brought up.,72,,
616,0.97,2673.57,2679.343,There were two unjust episodes in the International district in 2012 and in 2017.,72,,
617,0.97,2679.343,2682.012,And there was not sufficient mitigation planned.,72,,
618,0.97,2682.012,2684.314,There was a little bit of mitigation.,72,,
619,0.97,2684.314,2696.36,"But it was nowhere near sufficient and slated the stage for what we see today, which is the potential for large amounts of property to be bought up by developers.",72,,
620,0.97,2696.36,2705.769,And then built on and a large flood of people all with upper- end incomes come into the neighborhood at the same time.,72,,
621,0.97,2705.769,2707.871,"Which Upsettings, you know, drives up rent.",72,,
622,0.97,2707.871,2712.009,"And does not give people time to, you know, adjust to things.",72,,
623,0.97,2712.009,2714.378,And so that is a major issue.,72,,
624,0.97,2714.378,2719.883,And it needs to be addressed at the city policy level.,72,,
625,0.97,2719.883,2732.496,"One other huge opportunity that has been missed that we would like to not Miss going forward is that each one of these affordable housing project developments is, you know, 30, 40, 50 million dollars.",73,,
626,0.97,2732.496,2741.438,"So that's a lot of wealth and economic opportunity to actually close wealth gaps, et cetera, et cetera.",73,,
627,0.97,2741.438,2766.13,"But what we found is that there isn't sufficient systems, technical assistance in place to make sure that the contractor, when you think about everything from the legal transactions to the architectural design, to the contractors, Subcontractors, and workers, a lot of that money is leaving the community.",73,,
628,0.97,2766.13,2776.64,"And that money should stay in the impacted community to actually create the economic opportunities that we're speaking about, because again, the large majority of it is not.",73,,
629,0.97,2776.64,2783.347,"And so once again, it's putting our community in a position of somewhat of an exploited resource.",73,,
630,0.97,2783.347,2788.819,"Meaning someone else is benefiting economically the most, off of our Marginalization.",73,,
631,0.97,2788.819,2792.656,And even the attempt to fix the Marginalization.,73,,
632,0.97,2792.656,2796.393,But it Perpetuates through the process.,73,,
633,0.97,2796.393,2805.602,"We need significant resources put in place to have culturally responsive business development, support to access to capital for contractors.",73,,
634,0.97,2805.602,2815.512,"And again, we found the same issues that we get to these small businesses that wanted to go into the spaces that again don't have access to the capital.",73,,
635,0.97,2815.512,2824.454,And new construction presents greater challenges for Microentrepreneurs and smaller businesses with tenant improvements and things of that nature.,73,,
636,0.97,2824.454,2830.594,So I think we need some very focused resources for the community organizations to deal with that.,73,,
637,0.97,2830.594,2835.199,"The situation with the flower shop, which we were able to just help rally and save.",73,,
638,0.97,2835.199,2840.938,But she was negatively impacted by the construction on 23rd.,73,,
639,0.97,2840.938,2852.783,"And so again, we don't have those--that resource capacity in the community to we're just kind of running it on fumes and doing it on the love.",73,,
640,0.97,2852.783,2860.624,"And then when resources are allocated, they go to large institutions that are not in the community, right?",73,,
641,0.97,2860.624,2864.761,So if we're going to build programs around business development.,73,,
642,0.97,2864.761,2871.869,"Again these things should be rooted in the Community-Based organizations that are led by, you know, our communities that are supposed to be served.",73,,
643,0.97,2871.869,2875.839,Can I Piggyback off of some of the things he just said?,74,,
644,0.97,2875.839,2877.541,And this gentleman right here.,74,,
645,0.97,2877.541,2884.681,"First of all, when you look at the--problems here.",74,,
646,0.97,2884.681,2888.719,These problems are systematic.,74,,
647,0.97,2888.719,2889.019,Nationwide.,74,,
648,0.97,2889.019,2891.355,In areas where there's slum and blight.,74,,
649,0.97,2891.355,2893.757,Loss of manufacturing jobs.,74,,
650,0.97,2893.757,2898.161,But there are programs that are working in other parts of the country.,74,,
651,0.97,2898.161,2903.8,"I just saw on 60 minutes, a couple of weeks ago, where they had a similar program dealing with tenants.",74,,
652,0.97,2903.8,2909.673,And people were getting land and property and affordable property and housing and mortgages and Chase set up some kind of program.,74,,
653,0.97,2909.673,2914.911,So this is what I like to add to Ms. Morales' agenda.,74,,
654,0.97,2914.911,2927.658,"Can the city with this new economic development initiative, also look at some best practices around the country that can be adapted to the Seattle model that is dealing with marginalized people to keep them in their Homeoss their land and get them land and property.",74,,
655,0.97,2927.658,2929.927,I know there's working projects out there.,74,,
656,0.97,2929.927,2945.342,"And I think that it would benefit the city to look at what other people are doing about these problems, instead of trying to be a lone, you know, person that going to fix it all, without considering what can work and be adapted to the Seattle area.",74,,
657,0.97,2945.342,2954.584,"This--they had in the ""Seattle times"" the other day, it showed King County is one of the biggest places of Multiculturalism right now, in Seattle.",74,,
658,0.97,2954.584,2956.32,And this is through richness.,74,,
659,0.97,2956.32,2967.664,"It would be nice, I think, if the city considered getting linked up with academia, and professional researches and doing a nationwide best practices.",74,,
660,0.97,2967.664,2976.64,"Or looking overseas to see what other countries with similar population and issues are dealing with, with so many influx of Newness into their communities.",74,,
661,0.97,2976.64,2977.974,Great.,75,,
662,0.97,2977.974,2979.776,Dovetailing off these other comments.,76,,
663,0.97,2979.776,2991.722,Let me just say that we have noticed that the city sometimes has a hard time distinguishing between like your normal affordable housing provider.,76,,
664,0.97,2991.722,2997.127,"And a like, Community-Based affordable housing for providers.",76,,
665,0.97,2997.127,3005.202,"So we have seen money and like resources go to, you know, affordable housing providers, not from our community, to build projects in our community.",76,,
666,0.97,3005.202,3013.944,"And we think that money would be better placed with Community- based organizations such as us, friends of little Saigon, other people.",76,,
667,0.97,3013.944,3016.48,It happens over and over again.,76,,
668,0.97,3016.48,3027.124,"And even goes sometimes, housing money goes to private developers who are doing affordable projects, you know.",76,,
669,0.97,3027.124,3027.591,60% A.M.I.,76,,
670,0.97,3027.591,3028.392,Bare minimum stuff.,76,,
671,0.97,3028.392,3032.829,And so we are a lot more accountable to our community.,76,,
672,0.97,3032.829,3035.532,We know our community better.,76,,
673,0.97,3035.532,3043.74,"And we can be, the money should be routed to Community-Based organizations which are from and serve and are accountable to their community.",76,,
674,0.97,3043.74,3049.379,And do you think those sorts of things are happening because of familiarity?,77,,
675,0.97,3049.379,3052.048,Because of perceived capacity differences?,77,,
676,0.97,3052.048,3052.315,Or what?,77,,
677,0.97,3052.315,3053.717,Do you have a theory there?,77,,
678,0.97,3053.717,3059.856,"So I had been told before in some cases, it's like a cost per unit thing.",78,,
679,0.97,3059.856,3064.861,"Like because they're, what's called vertically integrated.",78,,
680,0.97,3064.861,3066.73,They--their cost premium is pretty low.,78,,
681,0.97,3066.73,3071.435,"And I think also, there is a familiarity thing going on, too.",78,,
682,0.97,3071.435,3076.64,I think that speaks to the institutionalized piece of this.,79,,
683,0.97,3076.64,3083.88,"If, in fact, their wealth and our capital was Mal distributed for, you know, 300 to 400 years.",79,,
684,0.97,3083.88,3096.193,"There's no way that we're going to have the same balance sheet as the people who, you know, benefited and received what was supposed to be hard capital and wealth.",79,,
685,0.97,3096.193,3105.735,"So there has to be bold, significant focused interventions to disrupt the status quo, which keeps us in a marginalized position.",79,,
686,0.97,3105.735,3107.504,So that has to be raised.,79,,
687,0.97,3107.504,3111.074,"Otherwise, you'll just keep perpetuating the same problem.",79,,
688,0.97,3111.074,3124.387,"If you say, well, this group has more capacity to do X, Y, Z. but in actuality, they don't have the capacity and the Competencies to serve the community in the ways that it needs.",79,,
689,0.97,3124.387,3130.994,Because many of these entities have been growing the whole time our community has been deteriorating.,79,,
690,0.97,3130.994,3134.764,"Can I say another thing, MS.",80,,
691,0.97,3134.764,3137.934,"Morales, based on what both of them just said.",80,,
692,0.97,3137.934,3146.576,"One of the missing variables is the ability for when these things are done, poor people will spend money in their communities.",80,,
693,0.97,3146.576,3155.452,"Therefore, when you look at economic development, those dollars, by staying in the community, are going to circulate in the community.",80,,
694,0.97,3155.452,3157.988,"Therefore, it's going to create more jobs.",80,,
695,0.97,3157.988,3161.258,And more money will come back to the communities.,80,,
696,0.97,3161.258,3164.794,"Whereas a private developer take it all, get their money, they gone.",80,,
697,0.97,3164.794,3165.061,Sure.,81,,
698,0.97,3165.061,3168.565,So I think this is another variable that the E.D.I.,82,,
699,0.97,3168.565,3170.2,Should look at.,82,,
700,0.97,3170.2,3174.371,"The propensity to generate income from the people themselves, internally.",82,,
701,0.97,3174.371,3177.073,And that money would therefore circulate in the community.,82,,
702,0.97,3177.073,3180.944,And that's the way it was when there was segregation.,82,,
703,0.97,3180.944,3183.88,And Red-Lining of people of color into their own communities.,82,,
704,0.97,3183.88,3186.082,The dollar stayed in their community.,82,,
705,0.97,3186.082,3189.553,They were able to set up small shops in the central district.,82,,
706,0.97,3189.553,3192.322,A lot of them flourished.,82,,
707,0.97,3192.322,3194.491,"Restaurants, nightclubs, across the board.",82,,
708,0.97,3194.491,3196.293,Even social fraternities and church groups.,82,,
709,0.97,3196.293,3201.865,So these are some things since this is about the economic development.,82,,
710,0.97,3201.865,3208.939,"There is a great potential for job development, with these two initiatives, for the money to stay in these communities and circulate in these communities.",82,,
711,0.97,3208.939,3212.576,And I think that would benefit the city and the neighborhoods as well.,82,,
712,0.97,3212.576,3214.144,"Well, I couldn't agree with you more.",83,,
713,0.97,3214.144,3215.612,I do think it's important.,83,,
714,0.97,3215.612,3227.49,That's part of what we're hoping to help raise in this committee throughout the year is the conversation about the fact that we have the purchasing power we need to make successful businesses in our communities.,83,,
715,0.97,3227.49,3236.066,"We don't have to go outside of our community to find the capacity, the expertise, the knowledge, the understanding of how to make things successful.",83,,
716,0.97,3236.066,3238.935,We just need to shift the way we're doing things a little bit.,83,,
717,0.97,3238.935,3242.706,So that we can make sure that that kind of investment happens.,83,,
718,0.97,3242.706,3244.441,And in turn.,84,,
719,0.97,3244.441,3249.546,"One more point, since we mentioned about circulating dollars.",84,,
720,0.97,3249.546,3253.116,We get that transportation right to West Seattle.,84,,
721,0.97,3253.116,3263.493,"Along West marginal way, that people can come with these Lucra Tive tourism industry that drops off billions of dollars in Seattle.",84,,
722,0.97,3263.493,3268.798,As long as there is no transportation to the Duwamish center.,84,,
723,0.97,3268.798,3273.336,Those natives are going to be left out of this economic boom.,84,,
724,0.97,3273.336,3281.444,"But if transportation was available, they could build their own tourism industry like all of the other Shopes and museums and downtown Seattle.",84,,
725,0.97,3281.444,3289.085,"And therefore, that would be more money make them Lessdependent on donors and Úothers in the long term.",84,,
726,0.97,3289.085,3303.667,"So I think transportation is a major variable for marginalized groups or spaces in Seattle that are not in the immediate downtown zone, with a new development on the waterfront that won't be a reality.",84,,
727,0.97,3303.667,3308.038,"The convention center alone, will be employing about 6,000 people as soon as it is built.",84,,
728,0.97,3308.038,3313.977,And I'm proud to say I signed off with the developers for the convention center because of the jobs.,84,,
729,0.97,3313.977,3316.68,They're already training people for the hospitality jobs.,84,,
730,0.97,3316.68,3321.518,We have to look long term Interms of what these can produce.,84,,
731,0.97,3321.518,3323.753,In terms of getting people with jobs.,84,,
732,0.97,3323.753,3327.624,And economic wealth being Recirculated in these communities.,84,,
733,0.97,3327.624,3329.659,And that will start Seattle into the 21st century.,84,,
734,0.97,3329.659,3330.827,To that point.,85,,
735,0.97,3330.827,3336.8,I just want to--those jobs have to allow the people to actually live in the city as well.,85,,
736,0.97,3336.8,3342.372,"And if people are going to build wealth, they're going to be looking toward homeownership.",85,,
737,0.97,3342.372,3355.852,I just want to lift up the need to focus more on also expanding the pool of resources for affordable homeownership opportunities in our community and in the city.,85,,
738,0.97,3355.852,3373.002,"And Lastly, as far as business development, resources, et cetera, we have been working to make the fire station to access the former fire station 6 on 23rd and Yesler as innovation Hub and business center, and that has been moving very slow.",85,,
739,0.97,3373.002,3376.673,It's one of the original E.D.I.,85,,
740,0.97,3376.673,3377.774,Projects.,85,,
741,0.97,3377.774,3391.287,"And they're still Meter-Maid that produce no economic, no cultural, no value that is consistent with the central area commercial realization.",85,,
742,0.97,3391.287,3395.692,Commercial revitalization plan or any other in the previous central area plans.,85,,
743,0.97,3395.692,3396.96,So that's really a blight.,85,,
744,0.97,3396.96,3403.299,And I think we need to remove and activate that space for a higher and better use.,85,,
745,0.97,3403.299,3408.605,Asap.,85,,
746,0.97,3408.605,3409.172,Councilmember Herbold?,86,,
747,0.97,3409.172,3411.474,Thank you so much.,87,,
748,0.97,3411.474,3418.948,"Since I learned of this relatively new model six months ago, I've just been taking every opportunity I can to talk about it.",87,,
749,0.97,3418.948,3420.316,You may already be aware.,87,,
750,0.97,3420.316,3439.836,"But because of a change in the Federal tax code, I think in 2017, there is this new investment product called the community investment trust, that mercy Corps has created to be Repicable in other jurisdictions.",87,,
751,0.97,3439.836,3448.111,"And basically, it's proprietary investment product, owned by mercy Corps but specifically built for application by other organizations in other jurisdictions.",87,,
752,0.97,3448.111,3458.054,It is designed to meet the needs and desires of Low- Tomoderate-Income families.,87,,
753,0.97,3458.054,3459.088,The first is in Portland.,87,,
754,0.97,3459.088,3460.924,It would provide 300.,87,,
755,0.97,3460.924,3464.627,It's basically a way to Crowd- source fund real estate.,87,,
756,0.97,3464.627,3477.273,So you can pull together hundreds of people in your community to make a 10 to $100 contribution per month.,87,,
757,0.97,3477.273,3480.777,"Low dollar investments, $10 to $100 per month.",87,,
758,0.97,3480.777,3487.35,And it has short and long-term results from those investors in the community through an annual dividend.,87,,
759,0.97,3487.35,3491.921,And the first project right now is they're in East Portland.,87,,
760,0.97,3491.921,3499.462,They're providing 300 to 500 families with long-term investment opportunity in a commercial retail building in their neighborhood.,87,,
761,0.97,3499.462,3525.388,And this was--this project was taken on under threat of redevelopment of a small sort of commercial mall that folks wanted to be able to keep the local businesses in place when there was apparent interest in selling the property to an investor.,87,,
762,0.97,3525.388,3538.268,"Over time, the $450,000 in initiate equity provided as debt to improve to impact investors.",87,,
763,0.97,3538.268,3543.172,They will track outcomes and impact on three Multireenforcing levels.,87,,
764,0.97,3543.172,3543.773,Individual family level.,87,,
765,0.97,3543.773,3549.545,The property tenant level and the community level.,87,,
766,0.97,3549.545,3561.291,And the goal is to be a powerful tool to inspire and enable people to improve their own financial well being as well as their community's health and prosperity.,87,,
767,0.97,3561.291,3578.574,"In addition to the Low-Dollar investments and short and long- term results for the community investors through an annual dividend, there is guaranteed protection from loss for investors, through a direct pay letter from a bank.",87,,
768,0.97,3578.574,3583.279,And then there's the capacity building that we talked about earlier.,87,,
769,0.97,3583.279,3594.09,"They provide a curriculum for moving from owning to owning, offered in five languages, covering budgeting, goal setting and risk and return.",87,,
770,0.97,3594.09,3597.293,So I'm going to pass--eye keep sharing this with folks.,87,,
771,0.97,3597.293,3604.968,I know there are folks in the executive who are aware of this model.,87,,
772,0.97,3604.968,3610.707,But I think it would be a really fantastic thing to work with the E.D.I.,87,,
773,0.97,3610.707,3617.18,"Program to see if we could make something like this a component of that program, so that we actually have property and community ownership.",87,,
774,0.97,3617.18,3617.714,Thank you.,88,,
775,0.97,3617.714,3622.418,"Well, I'm sorry to say that our time for this piece of the evening is wrapped up.",89,,
776,0.97,3622.418,3625.955,But I want to thank you all.,89,,
777,0.97,3625.955,3627.824,I've taken lots of notes.,89,,
778,0.97,3627.824,3632.495,So I'm probably going to be Fmg following up with you to see.,89,,
779,0.97,3632.495,3634.13,I think final comments.,89,,
780,0.97,3634.13,3640.303,"My 90 comment, we would like to meet with the director come to the community.",90,,
781,0.97,3640.303,3643.84,And really the Opcd staff has been working really hard.,90,,
782,0.97,3643.84,3644.741,They have been helpful.,90,,
783,0.97,3644.741,3649.212,And I know there have been transitions with O.E.D.,90,,
784,0.97,3649.212,3659.756,And I think it's not clear how they're going to implement and invest in Ray strategy that produces vitality for our commercial businesses in the central district and probably other places as well.,90,,
785,0.97,3659.756,3660.356,Okay.,91,,
786,0.97,3660.356,3668.064,But that is something that--we need a real plan that is working with O.E.D.,92,,
787,0.97,3668.064,3668.364,Great.,93,,
788,0.97,3668.364,3670.033,Happy to help facilitate that.,93,,
789,0.97,3670.033,3671.167,All right.,94,,
790,0.97,3671.167,3680.843,"My final comment is Justthat we need to adequately, and more than adequately mitigate displacement in our community.",95,,
791,0.97,3680.843,3684.514,And we need to do this for residents.,95,,
792,0.97,3684.514,3687.45,We need to do it to help struggling businesses.,95,,
793,0.97,3687.45,3693.489,And we need to do everything we can to make it so that our community is not displaced.,95,,
794,0.97,3693.489,3696.693,And our community benefits from the giant wealth of this city.,95,,
795,0.97,3696.693,3697.66,Great.,96,,
796,0.97,3697.66,3698.661,Thank you so much.,96,,
797,0.97,3698.661,3701.964,"My final comments would be, as I said earlier.",97,,
798,0.97,3701.964,3704.5,This is a great program.,97,,
799,0.97,3704.5,3707.203,And it has room for improvement.,97,,
800,0.97,3707.203,3712.608,And I applaud you all for setting it up and to keep it going and for seeing what the community has to say.,97,,
801,0.97,3712.608,3715.845,And for people who have been out there in the trenches.,97,,
802,0.97,3715.845,3717.747,Not sitting in an office.,97,,
803,0.97,3717.747,3718.081,So somewhere.,97,,
804,0.97,3718.081,3718.981,We're in the box.,97,,
805,0.97,3718.981,3720.917,We're not outside the box.,97,,
806,0.97,3720.917,3722.819,Real change agents are in the box.,97,,
807,0.97,3722.819,3724.454,Because that's where the problems are.,97,,
808,0.97,3724.454,3729.726,And here's an opportunity for you to listen to what we have to say and where these gaps are.,97,,
809,0.97,3729.726,3734.03,And this program has great potential to fill those gaps.,97,,
810,0.97,3734.03,3735.665,And we're appreciated very much.,97,,
811,0.97,3735.665,3736.099,Thank you.,98,,

830,0.97,3786.616,3786.782,Oh.,106,,
831,0.97,3786.782,3789.552,Do you need to read the item into the record.,106,,

836,0.97,3796.659,3799.929,If we could do some quick introductions.,108,,
837,0.97,3799.929,3802.865,"Introduce yourself, what organization or project you're representing.",108,,
838,0.97,3802.865,3805.434,And we'll go from there.,108,,
839,0.97,3805.434,3805.902,Hi.,109,,
840,0.97,3805.902,3807.236,I am Karen Toering.,109,,

843,0.97,3823.92,3832.728,"My name is Solomon Dube, I am the owner of cafe Avole down in South Seattle on Rainier and Holly.",110,,
844,0.97,3832.728,3838.034,It is much more of a community space than anything else.,110,,
845,0.97,3838.034,3849.245,"We have seen so much diversity in that community, so much change in that community, Tammy herself has frequented a lot.",110,,

848,0.97,3862.024,3863.86,Thank you.,111,,
849,0.97,3863.86,3865.661,Hi.,112,,
850,0.97,3865.661,3865.962,Hi.,113,,
851,0.97,3865.962,3868.364,My name is Tam Nguyen.,113,,
852,0.97,3868.364,3875.471,And I'm a small business owner for restaurant in little Saigon district.,113,,
853,0.97,3875.471,3896.092,"So I'm here, just want to share some of the challenges and I think that the city of Seattle can help small business to try to be successful and, you know, to be more inclusive in our community.",113,,
854,0.97,3896.092,3896.492,Thank you.,114,,
855,0.97,3896.492,3898.561,So I'm looking at my questions.,115,,
856,0.97,3898.561,3902.999,And realizing that I seem to have a bias in my questioning around ownership.,115,,
857,0.97,3902.999,3906.202,So I'm going to start with those.,115,,
858,0.97,3906.202,3909.605,"And then, please, if there are other issues you think we need to be talking about.",115,,
859,0.97,3909.605,3910.106,Let us know.,115,,
860,0.97,3910.106,3915.511,"So the first question is, how did you, or how do other businesses find their space?",115,,
861,0.97,3915.511,3920.549,And how can the city help with Affordability of their space?,115,,
862,0.97,3920.549,3923.92,Oh.,116,,
863,0.97,3923.92,3927.023,I found my space in 2014.,116,,
864,0.97,3927.023,3930.626,And it was just with the ambition to start a business.,116,,
865,0.97,3930.626,3937.133,The family that owned that space was of an immigrant descent.,116,,
866,0.97,3937.133,3941.938,And they were looking for ways out of the business because it wasn't working for themselves.,116,,
867,0.97,3941.938,3947.943,"And so, with my ambition, I walked up there, with little money, no money at all.",116,,
868,0.97,3947.943,3950.947,Really just started the conversation.,116,,
869,0.97,3950.947,3956.319,And convinced them to sell me the business.,116,,
870,0.97,3956.319,3964.226,"And that transition in getting into that space and Transitioning into--it was at that point, a grocery store.",116,,
871,0.97,3964.226,3964.56,And --,116,,
872,0.97,3964.56,3966.762,I used to go to that grocery store.,117,,
873,0.97,3966.762,3967.897,It was right up the street.,118,,
874,0.97,3967.897,3971.867,"And he would say, it's going to be a cafe someday.",119,,
875,0.97,3971.867,3974.537,"And I would be like, Uh-huh.",119,,
876,0.97,3974.537,3975.071,Yeah.,119,,
877,0.97,3975.071,3975.571,But seriously.,120,,
878,0.97,3975.571,3979.175,I had that ambition to turn that space into a coffee shop.,120,,
879,0.97,3979.175,3981.978,But I didn't know how.,120,,
880,0.97,3981.978,3991.253,"It wasn't until maybe my third year of engaging with folks in the community, folks like Karen, telling my dream and my idea that I was able to crowd source at that time.",120,,
881,0.97,3991.253,3995.091,"Because you know, right after college, I didn't have the best of credit.",120,,
882,0.97,3995.091,4002.098,But just a dream and the idea of what I wanted to do.,120,,
883,0.97,4002.098,4009.305,"And so I crowd--we did a Crowd-Funding campaign, raised funds and people in the community were really on it.",120,,
884,0.97,4009.305,4013.809,And we used those funds to transition into the coffee shop.,120,,
885,0.97,4013.809,4018.781,I literally hammered all the nails and painted the walls and did whatever it took to really turn that place around.,120,,
886,0.97,4018.781,4020.182,Wow.,121,,
887,0.97,4020.182,4023.319,And now it's a bustling little corner of the neighborhood.,122,,
888,0.97,4023.319,4024.22,"Yes, it is.",123,,
889,0.97,4024.22,4026.422,Very nice.,124,,
890,0.97,4026.422,4026.689,Yeah.,125,,
891,0.97,4026.689,4028.357,So that's where I'm at today.,125,,
892,0.97,4028.357,4029.492,Anybody else?,126,,
893,0.97,4029.492,4036.532,"Well, for the black and Tan was founded by three long-time community activists.",127,,
894,0.97,4036.532,4039.535,And artists.,127,,
895,0.97,4039.535,4045.841,"Ben Hunter, Rodney Harrell and Tarec chef, Tarec Abdullah.",127,,
896,0.97,4045.841,4052.047,And they had a vision for a space where equity was real.,127,,
897,0.97,4052.047,4056.919,Which is why we're not a nonprofit.,127,,
898,0.97,4056.919,4058.12,Because equity is ownership.,127,,
899,0.97,4058.12,4097.96,"So we wanted to create a business that really was, you know, that held our values as people who have lived in the South end for a really long time, that provided cultural space, where people feel welcome, as a long-time resident of the South end, there are literally places along the Rainier corridor, where I just don't feel welcome, you know, no matter how inviting or how well lit or what they have going on there, there's just something about those spaces that you know, say in very unspoken ways, you know, maybe not you.",127,,
900,0.97,4097.96,4099.395,Right?,127,,
901,0.97,4099.395,4102.298,And so our partnership.,127,,
902,0.97,4102.298,4128.624,"And it's roughly 27 active partners, most of which who live somewhere within a Two- mile radius of the space that we were trying to open, who felt the same way, that this, because of displacement, because of all of the things that have happened in our neighborhood, that we wanted to create a space where people that look like us, that, you know, had our values, you know, felt welcome and engaged.",127,,
903,0.97,4128.624,4130.259,And over the last three years.,127,,
904,0.97,4130.259,4134.23,"You know, the partnership has been working to create that space.",127,,
905,0.97,4134.23,4136.999,Create that vision.,127,,
906,0.97,4136.999,4140.336,That's great.,128,,
907,0.97,4140.336,4140.636,Thank you.,128,,
908,0.97,4140.636,4144.34,"So our family restaurant, we started in 2004.",129,,
909,0.97,4144.34,4145.875,The reason I want to set it up.,129,,
910,0.97,4145.875,4156.986,"Because I just wanted to make sure that our community have a place that we can call home, to come in and enjoy our food.",129,,
911,0.97,4156.986,4157.419,Our culture.,129,,
912,0.97,4157.419,4168.631,"And create a space that you know, we can give the employees to have a Healthcare.",129,,
913,0.97,4168.631,4174.37,To have a good wage and to have a place that is safe from the work.,129,,
914,0.97,4174.37,4177.139,And to be working in this industry.,129,,
915,0.97,4177.139,4181.477,And we have been doing that since 2004.,129,,
916,0.97,4181.477,4184.446,And we don't own the property.,129,,
917,0.97,4184.446,4186.649,We just been renting it.,129,,
918,0.97,4186.649,4196.892,"And since then, we wanted to find a way, how do we as a small business owner, to create.",129,,
919,0.97,4196.892,4203.098,"We have been creating this institution for the community, for the community to come in and enjoy.",129,,
920,0.97,4203.098,4204.166,How do we sustain?,129,,
921,0.97,4204.166,4216.779,"How do we be able to be there, not being taken out by developers, who are going to come in and snap the property?",129,,
922,0.97,4216.779,4221.584,Because we are help for to come.,129,,
923,0.97,4221.584,4224.62,It is a challenge for our community as a whole.,129,,
924,0.97,4224.62,4236.398,"But for my family personally, that we have been trying to be kick out by the landlord because developers buying and thinking of buying.",129,,
925,0.97,4236.398,4240.636,And I think they put on sale for that property right now.,129,,
926,0.97,4240.636,4243.839,So a lot of customer come and talk to us.,129,,
927,0.97,4243.839,4245.541,And we have no answer.,129,,
928,0.97,4245.541,4249.211,"We say, we don't know when we'll be out.",129,,
929,0.97,4249.211,4252.748,So it is a threat to our community.,129,,
930,0.97,4252.748,4259.154,As a whole for our family as small business owner.,129,,
931,0.97,4259.154,4270.132,So that's why I'm--I'm very glad that the city Council has created this opportunity for us to share some of our challenges and find a solution.,129,,
932,0.97,4270.132,4272.167,How do we do it?,129,,
933,0.97,4272.167,4276.071,And I have a couple of solutions that I want to share with you later on.,129,,
934,0.97,4276.071,4276.472,Great.,130,,
935,0.97,4276.472,4278.007,When it's come to that time.,131,,
936,0.97,4278.007,4279.408,"Well, I will ask that next.",132,,
937,0.97,4279.408,4281.076,But I want to ask first.,132,,
938,0.97,4281.076,4285.781,Do you own either the land or the building?,132,,
939,0.97,4285.781,4286.582,You're both renting as well?,132,,
940,0.97,4286.582,4288.951,Both renting.,133,,
941,0.97,4288.951,4297.126,And our motto is an Anti- Gent risks model.,134,,
942,0.97,4297.126,4301.997,It is Prointing at the placement of small business owners like us.,134,,
943,0.97,4301.997,4305.501,"I'm imagining when you mentioned, you don't know where you're going to go.",134,,
944,0.97,4305.501,4308.704,Probably not going to be in the city.,134,,
945,0.97,4308.704,4313.976,"And you know, that's what everybody is holding onto that doesn't own their property.",134,,
946,0.97,4313.976,4317.813,Is that your next move is going to be out of town.,134,,
947,0.97,4317.813,4318.08,You know?,134,,
948,0.97,4318.08,4322.818,That's the only place where you can have that kind of Affordability.,134,,
949,0.97,4322.818,4326.822,"And you know, people all over town are holding their breath.",134,,
950,0.97,4326.822,4331.56,"Because of property owners who are seeing you know, their property values increase.",134,,
951,0.97,4331.56,4341.403,"And you know, the opportunity to sell, you know, from a developer that like the previous Panelist said, can outbid them.",134,,
952,0.97,4341.403,4341.837,"You know, 2-1.",134,,
953,0.97,4341.837,4351.48,"So even if you can scrape up the money, there's always the chance that you know, someone else with more money is going to be able to come in and take your dream away.",134,,
954,0.97,4351.48,4352.414,Right.,135,,
955,0.97,4352.414,4353.949,To Piggyback off of that.,136,,
956,0.97,4353.949,4356.085,"You know, that's one of our biggest challenges.",136,,
957,0.97,4356.085,4361.123,Like I cannot continue to invest into my space.,136,,
958,0.97,4361.123,4368.063,And I need to invest in my space to expand example but the second I decide to put money into it.,136,,
959,0.97,4368.063,4369.465,"The landlord says, Ch-Ching.",136,,
960,0.97,4369.465,4378.24,"And now, his value of his property rises and my value as a tenant just is out the window.",136,,
961,0.97,4378.24,4381.377,So a five-year lease doesn't work if I put all of my money into it.,136,,
962,0.97,4381.377,4388.283,"Something like an ownership model, and maybe even a partnership model, would be more beneficial.",136,,
963,0.97,4388.283,4393.655,Because then I can invest money into my property or Intomy space.,136,,
964,0.97,4393.655,4397.793,And then you know in the next 10 or 15 years that I'm still going to be there.,136,,
965,0.97,4397.793,4403.165,I'm still going to be sustainable and gone from just surviving to thriving.,136,,
966,0.97,4403.165,4403.499,Exactly.,137,,
967,0.97,4403.499,4406.135,And a lot of immigrants face the same challenge.,138,,
968,0.97,4406.135,4409.004,And a lot of people are color face the same challenge.,138,,
969,0.97,4409.004,4409.304,Every day.,138,,
970,0.97,4409.304,4409.972,And some people don't know.,138,,
971,0.97,4409.972,4414.009,There's a lot of people that pour a all of their money into a space.,138,,
972,0.97,4414.009,4417.112,"And like you said, next day, don't know where they're going to be.",138,,
973,0.97,4417.112,4418.013,You don't know.,139,,
974,0.97,4418.013,4425.12,And the reason that we are no longer tenants in 5608 Rainier was because of that very same thing.,139,,
975,0.97,4425.12,4432.928,"It's like, we were blessed to also be, you know, part of an E.D.I.",139,,
976,0.97,4432.928,4436.932,"Cohort, shout out to the E.D.I.",139,,
977,0.97,4436.932,4437.232,Initiative.,139,,
978,0.97,4437.232,4437.733,It has been incredible.,139,,
979,0.97,4437.733,4444.139,I hope we get a chance to sing their praises a little more of the staff.,139,,
980,0.97,4444.139,4453.949,"But the partners basically decided, you know, that because we have this money, from the city, we consider ourselves stewards of that money.",139,,
981,0.97,4453.949,4457.92,"And you know, as stewards of, you know, these resources.",139,,
982,0.97,4457.92,4460.022,"You know, because it's all of our money.",139,,
983,0.97,4460.022,4461.924,We have to be smart about it.,139,,
984,0.97,4461.924,4466.395,And we can't make tenant improvements on a building they're going to away from us.,139,,
985,0.97,4466.395,4471.466,That's just--it's just not good business.,139,,
986,0.97,4471.466,4475.37,So you mentioned a partnership.,140,,
987,0.97,4475.37,4478.073,I wanted to ask about other tools that are out there.,140,,
988,0.97,4478.073,4480.342,Sounds like you have some ideas.,140,,
989,0.97,4480.342,4484.98,"You know, we know about long- term leases.",140,,
990,0.97,4484.98,4491.053,"About real estate investment Cooperatives, which I think might be what you're talking about, with Curtis?",140,,
991,0.97,4491.053,4491.687,Uh-huh.,141,,
992,0.97,4491.687,4502.364,"Public development authorities that could own the assets to behalf the city and sort of Master-Lease to community, for at least permanently affordable commercial space.",142,,
993,0.97,4502.364,4513.408,So I'd just be curious to hear if what you think of any of these tools or if there are other tools that you are thinking to improve the ability of community members to own the properties for rent.,142,,
994,0.97,4513.408,4517.713,When we start our business back in 2004.,143,,
995,0.97,4517.713,4520.182,That's before the Upzone in our neighborhood.,143,,
996,0.97,4520.182,4530.993,"And when the city Upzoned, they didn't have the mitigation planning to foresee all of the problem.",143,,
997,0.97,4530.993,4534.696,"And we informed the city, when you Upzone, nay will be kicking Úout.",143,,
998,0.97,4534.696,4536.832,They will be kicking us out.,143,,
999,0.97,4536.832,4537.733,Once the Upzone is approved.,143,,
1000,0.97,4537.733,4540.903,"And we want to know what the mitigation is, the city didn't have it.",143,,
1001,0.97,4540.903,4543.138,And it's still now they don't have it.,143,,
1002,0.97,4543.138,4545.34,"And before the city want to, you know.",143,,
1003,0.97,4545.34,4550.012,I think that policy needs to have an ending.,143,,
1004,0.97,4550.012,4557.286,"So when they do that, we know that will be kicking out at any time.",143,,
1005,0.97,4557.286,4569.197,"And once the zoning Upzone, we got--we got different folks coming in, telling us, hey.",143,,
1006,0.97,4569.197,4571.366,What are you going to do?,143,,
1007,0.97,4571.366,4575.57,They going to buy out this space.,143,,
1008,0.97,4575.57,4582.778,"So we work with different community, different developers, in our community.",143,,
1009,0.97,4582.778,4588.85,"We tried to engage with them, to inform them, hey.",143,,
1010,0.97,4588.85,4597.492,"When you went into development in our community, what are the thing that you are going to do to include the small businesses?",143,,
1011,0.97,4597.492,4605.968,To provide affordable rent or how do you sustain the fabric of our community?,143,,
1012,0.97,4605.968,4607.769,Because one once we are out.,143,,
1013,0.97,4607.769,4611.707,You have broken the fabric of this community that we have been building.,143,,
1014,0.97,4611.707,4616.578,And so they--they engage--they keep talking talking.,143,,
1015,0.97,4616.578,4617.946,And then once it develop.,143,,
1016,0.97,4617.946,4621.216,They no longer talking to us.,143,,
1017,0.97,4621.216,4627.422,And the rent on those development is just like market rate.,143,,
1018,0.97,4627.422,4635.13,"So there are, you know, we talk about Gentriification.",143,,
1019,0.97,4635.13,4643.305,"And for the small business, Wgentify.",143,,
1020,0.97,4643.305,4645.54,This developer receives funding from the city.,143,,
1021,0.97,4645.54,4650.545,This developer received the money from the King County.,143,,
1022,0.97,4650.545,4654.349,"And some of them, they are not far from Seattle.",143,,
1023,0.97,4654.349,4657.419,And I can name you them.,143,,
1024,0.97,4657.419,4657.753,Those names.,143,,
1025,0.97,4657.753,4660.122,If you want to know.,143,,
1026,0.97,4660.122,4666.361,But they--they are not from here.,143,,
1027,0.97,4666.361,4667.963,And as Wyking pointed out.,143,,
1028,0.97,4667.963,4677.739,"These are the folks that grabbed the money, take advantage of this opportunity, and they leave town and leave it for us to deal with the problem.",143,,
1029,0.97,4677.739,4681.009,But they put our Brown faces on the brochures.,144,,
1030,0.97,4681.009,4681.443,Uh-huh.,145,,
1031,0.97,4681.443,4686.448,"And you know, the slide decks and the presentations.",146,,
1032,0.97,4686.448,4697.192,"So my proposal, one proposal that I think is a benefit for the small business owners are list to own.",147,,
1033,0.97,4697.192,4698.427,-- lease to own.,147,,
1034,0.97,4698.427,4713.308,"Since the city is funding the resources to help the small business to be thriving, to sustain in the neighborhood, if you already give the funding to the developer, ask them.",147,,
1035,0.97,4713.308,4726.321,Figure out your financial situation so that you are going to economize this retail for the small business to go in and lease to own.,147,,
1036,0.97,4726.321,4729.224,Because we don't have the front money to buy it.,147,,
1037,0.97,4729.224,4732.327,But we can pay over time and become owner.,147,,
1038,0.97,4732.327,4734.329,"Once we become owner, you know we work hard.",147,,
1039,0.97,4734.329,4737.933,And all the business owners right here.,147,,
1040,0.97,4737.933,4738.633,We work hard.,147,,
1041,0.97,4738.633,4740.869,And we never give up.,147,,
1042,0.97,4740.869,4755.45,"And so when you say that you want to engage the community to make sure that community will be thriving, I think that's a key, key thing is to let them lease to own so that they can own the property.",147,,
1043,0.97,4755.45,4757.252,They're going to protect their property.,147,,
1044,0.97,4757.252,4766.595,They're going to make sure the property is safe in our community.,147,,
1045,0.97,4766.595,4771.633,Without that policy.,147,,
1046,0.97,4771.633,4774.77,When you develop there is a lot of loop hole.,147,,
1047,0.97,4774.77,4778.774,"But when we engage with the community, we can point out the loophole.",147,,
1048,0.97,4778.774,4780.775,"For example, the lease to own.",147,,
1049,0.97,4780.775,4784.112,"I have been talking to Artis, the developer.",147,,
1050,0.97,4784.112,4790.919,"He says, well, our hand is tied because there's a restriction that we cannot do anything with a retail space.",147,,
1051,0.97,4790.919,4794.656,"I said, well, you know, retail space is underground.",147,,
1052,0.97,4794.656,4797.092,Don't you have a foundation to build?,147,,
1053,0.97,4797.092,4809.104,Don't you have the infrastructure around that foundation for that ground floor to be a workable space?,147,,
1054,0.97,4809.104,4809.538,So it's rebuild.,147,,
1055,0.97,4809.538,4818.947,Why can't we go in with affordable brand or lease to own opportunity?,147,,
1056,0.97,4818.947,4821.149,They said their hands are tied.,147,,
1057,0.97,4821.149,4826.221,"So I think that's another policy you guys can look at to say, Hey, you are going to do it.",147,,
1058,0.97,4826.221,4836.431,"You guys need to figure out your financial strategy, how do you include this lease to own policy into our community?",147,,
1059,0.97,4836.431,4839.134,Especially that you receiving the funding from us.,147,,
1060,0.97,4839.134,4840.735,From the city.,148,,
1061,0.97,4840.735,4844.339,Yeah.,148,,
1062,0.97,4844.339,4846.041,Oh.,149,,
1063,0.97,4846.041,4846.241,No.,149,,
1064,0.97,4846.241,4848.276,I was going to Piggyback off that.,149,,
1065,0.97,4848.276,4854.749,"You know, him and I were both on that advisory Council years back for commercial Affordability.",149,,
1066,0.97,4854.749,4858.453,And I think we need to look at that and maybe designate somebody in O.E.D.,149,,
1067,0.97,4858.453,4863.024,Or somebody that can go in and advocate for those that speak a different language.,149,,
1068,0.97,4863.024,4864.626,For those that don't understand the system.,149,,
1069,0.97,4864.626,4876.771,"And be able to help navigate how to negotiate these deals or set up some sort of structure so that businesses can go into retail space and with full confidence that they are--you know, that they're protected.",149,,
1070,0.97,4876.771,4880.475,And I think that's another issue.,149,,
1071,0.97,4880.475,4885.847,And we've talked on about some of the issues that are faced through tenant improvement.,149,,
1072,0.97,4885.847,4886.781,And things like that.,149,,
1073,0.97,4886.781,4892.887,And I think there's a lot of confusion when it comes to how that process works.,149,,
1074,0.97,4892.887,4894.923,I know some folks understand it.,149,,
1075,0.97,4894.923,4895.357,And that's great.,149,,
1076,0.97,4895.357,4899.16,But there are a lot of people out there that don't understand it.,149,,
1077,0.97,4899.16,4901.696,And I think that's where the support is needed.,149,,
1078,0.97,4901.696,4915.11,Or even just having one of the things I've heard a lot is having maybe a template at least agreement that can be translated into other languages so that some folks can have document in languages they understand.,150,,
1079,0.97,4915.11,4922.083,What I've heard from some of the communities whose first language isn't English is at least document a contract.,150,,
1080,0.97,4922.083,4927.222,All of the lending documents are hard to navigate if you don't speak the language.,150,,
1081,0.97,4927.222,4930.625,And you can get bullied from landlords.,151,,
1082,0.97,4930.625,4932.494,I've gotten bullied from my landlord.,151,,
1083,0.97,4932.494,4934.029,We've gotten bullied from our landlord.,152,,
1084,0.97,4934.029,4939.434,"We had an agreement before I moved in, before I turned that space into the coffee shop.",153,,
1085,0.97,4939.434,4944.673,"And you know, he just now is talking about, I don't know what you're talking about.",153,,
1086,0.97,4944.673,4946.975,Never offered to sell you the space.,153,,
1087,0.97,4946.975,4948.743,"And you know, that's frustrating for me.",153,,
1088,0.97,4948.743,4951.646,Because here I was with a little bit of money that I had.,153,,
1089,0.97,4951.646,4954.082,And I turned around that space.,153,,
1090,0.97,4954.082,4960.755,"And sure enough, maybe my misunderstanding as well.",153,,
1091,0.97,4960.755,4970.632,"Of how to properly put together that proposal, but not having somebody on my side to protect me, was very, very upsetting.",153,,
1092,0.97,4970.632,4970.899,Great.,154,,
1093,0.97,4970.899,4978.473,"And somebody mentioned earlier the city as you know, acting as a guarantee to investors.",154,,
1094,0.97,4978.473,4987.849,"Particularly where city dollars are invested for example, the E.D.I.",154,,
1095,0.97,4987.849,4988.383,Funds that we received.,154,,
1096,0.97,4988.383,4995.99,"And there is a lot more, just muscle that the city can provide, when, you know, community resources are at stake.",154,,
1097,0.97,4995.99,5004.599,And help us sort of either put these developers and landlords at ease.,154,,
1098,0.97,5004.599,5008.103,There's some backing of somebody bigger than us.,154,,
1099,0.97,5008.103,5008.403,Right.,155,,
1100,0.97,5008.403,5010.271,As small business owners.,156,,
1101,0.97,5010.271,5014.209,That's one way the city can help in support.,156,,
1102,0.97,5014.209,5019.314,And we've seen that just working with the E.D.I.,156,,
1103,0.97,5019.314,5033.328,Staff: I cannot believe the Origami Celtic knots that they've twisted themselves into to come up with this creative thinking to help us get our business off the ground in a stable way.,156,,
1104,0.97,5033.328,5041.536,"It's been really--there have been times I have hung up the phone can staff and just went, Whoa, what just happened?",156,,
1105,0.97,5041.536,5046.341,"Because you know, that out of the box thinking was things we could never imagine.",156,,
1106,0.97,5046.341,5052.781,"But you have those resources and that knowledge and the staffing, you know, to do that exploratory stuff.",156,,
1107,0.97,5052.781,5054.916,"You know, we're running our businesses.",156,,
1108,0.97,5054.916,5063.358,"And in the case of black and Tan, you know, 85% of us have full-time jobs while we're trying to launch this business.",156,,
1109,0.97,5063.358,5063.858,Right.,157,,
1110,0.97,5063.858,5070.265,So we need the people who have the resources to do their research.,158,,
1111,0.97,5070.265,5071.533,To look at the trends.,158,,
1112,0.97,5071.533,5074.202,"To look at models, to do the studies.",158,,
1113,0.97,5074.202,5076.471,"So that we, you know, we have something.",158,,
1114,0.97,5076.471,5077.939,Some ground to stand on.,158,,
1115,0.97,5077.939,5083.978,"One thing I wanted to Adadwas, you know, I drive up and down Rainier every day.",159,,
1116,0.97,5083.978,5085.48,From home to work.,159,,
1117,0.97,5085.48,5092.854,And I always notice that there's small little Microbusiness districts that rarely get looked at.,159,,
1118,0.97,5092.854,5102.297,"And the majority of them are people of color, immigrants that are in those spaces that don't know how to leverage the city support.",159,,
1119,0.97,5102.297,5108.069,"And so like I want to see how we can support them, you know, from here on out.",159,,
1120,0.97,5108.069,5112.307,"And say, like how can we Incubate those areas?",159,,
1121,0.97,5112.307,5115.376,"Sooner or later, there are spaces that developers are looking at.",159,,
1122,0.97,5115.376,5120.448,"And we're looking at and say, Oh, you know, this place is being underutilized.",159,,
1123,0.97,5120.448,5124.819,"But in fact, it's not being underutilized.",159,,
1124,0.97,5124.819,5125.92,It's being utilized by the community.,159,,
1125,0.97,5125.92,5136.364,But they don't have the resources to build that and build the infrastructure they need so they can be in a new establishment and building and thus compete with others from down the street that are developing and such.,159,,
1126,0.97,5136.364,5140.635,Because they will be affected and they are being affected.,159,,
1127,0.97,5140.635,5141.436,That's great.,160,,
1128,0.97,5141.436,5144.906,"Well, there's a lot of work to do, clearly.",160,,
1129,0.97,5144.906,5155.149,And I am definitely interested in talking to you all more about different ownership models and what we Miebl able to do to facilitate something a little more robust for folks.,160,,
1130,0.97,5155.149,5160.822,If you want to make any final comments before we bring the next group up?,160,,
1131,0.97,5160.822,5161.623,Council members?,160,,
1132,0.97,5161.623,5162.757,"Go ahead, council.",161,,
1133,0.97,5162.757,5164.192,"Oh, no.",162,,
1134,0.97,5164.192,5166.427,Thank you.,162,,
1135,0.97,5166.427,5166.561,.,162,,
1136,0.97,5166.561,5180.408,"I think, well, again, I want to thank you, the city Council, to have this opportunity for small business owners to come and share the challenges.",163,,
1137,0.97,5180.408,5207.101,"But I think one more thing we can do for small businesses is, I have experienced firsthand that even nonprofit organizations require small businesses with number of certificates that unreasonable certificate for us to do business.",163,,
1138,0.97,5207.101,5217.712,I give you one example is we need to clean the hood of our restaurant.,163,,
1139,0.97,5217.712,5222.283,And we renting this space from a nonprofit group.,163,,
1140,0.97,5222.283,5227.922,They require this small business--because I prefer to work with a small business owner.,163,,
1141,0.97,5227.922,5229.123,To do the job.,163,,
1142,0.97,5229.123,5236.631,"You know, to maintain our restaurant.",163,,
1143,0.97,5236.631,5251.446,"But small business owner didn't ask to provide different kind of certificate, different kind of insurance, different kind of commercial bonds that small business owner, they don't even have.",163,,
1144,0.97,5251.446,5256.351,"And they said, they've never heard of this before.",163,,
1145,0.97,5256.351,5260.455,"So, you know, we scheduled these people to show up.",163,,
1146,0.97,5260.455,5264.092,"They said, Oh, you cannot go into the building.",163,,
1147,0.97,5264.092,5269.564,Because you don't have a fall prevention certificate.,163,,
1148,0.97,5269.564,5270.565,No one has that.,163,,
1149,0.97,5270.565,5274.535,"I mean, asking around.",163,,
1150,0.97,5274.535,5279.707,"Until there are big company who has a lot of, you know, this Beck company.",163,,
1151,0.97,5279.707,5284.379,They have been around for a long time.,163,,
1152,0.97,5284.379,5286.347,And they are not Minority- owned.,163,,
1153,0.97,5286.347,5287.849,They are not small businesses.,163,,
1154,0.97,5287.849,5290.284,They have all kind of certificates.,163,,
1155,0.97,5290.284,5293.454,So even this nonprofit that I'm working with.,163,,
1156,0.97,5293.454,5294.756,That I'm renting from.,163,,
1157,0.97,5294.756,5301.229,They prevent the small business owner to go in and take the business that I want to share.,163,,
1158,0.97,5301.229,5301.562,Sure.,164,,
1159,0.97,5301.562,5301.763,Yeah.,164,,
1160,0.97,5301.763,5307.702,"So to me, that is a dilemma.",165,,
1161,0.97,5307.702,5315.743,"And so very frustrating that even right now, I'm trying to get a small business owner to come in to get a bid.",165,,
1162,0.97,5315.743,5319.647,They make it so hard for me to bring a small business owner to go in.,165,,
1163,0.97,5319.647,5323.117,"Because I said, you don't have the certificate.",165,,
1164,0.97,5323.117,5325.62,You are not bonded to do this.,165,,
1165,0.97,5325.62,5326.888,And to do that.,165,,
1166,0.97,5326.888,5331.025,And it becomes--I feel like okay.,165,,
1167,0.97,5331.025,5332.226,I'm a small business owner.,165,,
1168,0.97,5332.226,5335.096,I want to support other small business owners.,165,,
1169,0.97,5335.096,5338.166,"But they--this nonprofit, supposed to work with me.",165,,
1170,0.97,5338.166,5342.136,But they are not allowing me to do this.,165,,
1171,0.97,5342.136,5346.274,"I mean, that speaks to the sort of structural problem that we have here, right?",166,,
1172,0.97,5346.274,5351.245,"There's all of these layers that get inserted for, I'm sure very good reasons.",166,,
1173,0.97,5351.245,5359.954,"But if it's keeping our small businesses from being successful, then we need to maybe Unwind some of that and maybe see if there is a different way to do it.",166,,
1174,0.97,5359.954,5361.856,Yeah.,167,,
1175,0.97,5361.856,5364.359,It's almost like policy red lining.,168,,
1176,0.97,5364.359,5364.625,Yeah.,169,,
1177,0.97,5364.625,5368.463,But I had like a whole page of stuff that I wanted to say.,170,,
1178,0.97,5368.463,5371.566,But I'll keep it to this.,170,,
1179,0.97,5371.566,5380.575,I want to support the policy alignment and interpret a comments that were made earlier.,170,,
1180,0.97,5380.575,5384.612,"Yeah, it depends on who you're talking to and which office that day.",170,,
1181,0.97,5384.612,5388.583,Because Sally don't work on Wednesdays and Joe is there Fridays.,170,,
1182,0.97,5388.583,5392.253,"And you know, the cross departmental chatter.",170,,
1183,0.97,5392.253,5401.129,"So the opportunity to speak to multiple departments and have them come to us, instead of us having to, you know, come downtown.",170,,
1184,0.97,5401.129,5406.934,"The--you know, opportunities to participate in large health insurance.",170,,
1185,0.97,5406.934,5407.201,You know.,170,,
1186,0.97,5407.201,5411.139,"I mean, small business owners, we want to provide.",170,,
1187,0.97,5411.139,5412.106,Living wage jobs.,170,,
1188,0.97,5412.106,5415.476,That's more looking like 60.,170,,
1189,0.97,5415.476,5416.577,"$60,000 a year.",170,,
1190,0.97,5416.577,5418.613,Thn you gotTA pay insurance.,170,,
1191,0.97,5418.613,5419.614,Health insurance.,170,,
1192,0.97,5419.614,5422.016,That kind of stuff.,170,,
1193,0.97,5422.016,5428.322,Some opportunities to participate in larger groups.,170,,
1194,0.97,5428.322,5429.957,Which brings the cost down.,170,,
1195,0.97,5429.957,5432.56,And just safety without Militarization.,170,,
1196,0.97,5432.56,5432.794,Right?,170,,
1197,0.97,5432.794,5437.298,I want the people that come to the black and Tan to feel safe.,170,,
1198,0.97,5437.298,5442.804,"But I do not want to be Overmilitarized you know, under the guise of safety.",170,,
1199,0.97,5442.804,5444.639,Thank you for that.,171,,
1200,0.97,5444.639,5447.708,Very good.,172,,
1201,0.97,5447.708,5447.975,Yeah.,173,,
1202,0.97,5447.975,5448.443,So for myself.,173,,
1203,0.97,5448.443,5458.519,"As I mentioned from the beginning, it's a great deal for me, being a person of color to be at this table and main other tables that I've had the chance to be at.",173,,
1204,0.97,5458.519,5463.958,And I think it's intertwined when you think about economic development in the youth.,173,,
1205,0.97,5463.958,5467.161,And I think the kids are being undervalued.,173,,
1206,0.97,5467.161,5476.47,I think it's important to also address some of the social issues that kids are facing and Seattle public school district.,173,,
1207,0.97,5476.47,5481.342,Because someone like myself can get told I will never graduate.,173,,
1208,0.97,5481.342,5484.679,"Or someone like myself, can get told I won't go to college.",173,,
1209,0.97,5484.679,5485.279,Yet I'm here today.,173,,
1210,0.97,5485.279,5489.183,I think there is another aspect to this that also needs to be addressed.,173,,
1211,0.97,5489.183,5489.55,Definitely.,174,,
1212,0.97,5489.55,5491.686,Thank you so much.,174,,
1213,0.97,5491.686,5495.489,Can I just inject just one last thing?,175,,
1214,0.97,5495.489,5500.995,Public safety in our community is so horrible that prevent businesses to thrive.,175,,
1215,0.97,5500.995,5509.003,"And so, you know, because of different agency brought different services in our community without mitigation.",175,,
1216,0.97,5509.003,5517.912,So there are a lot of problem with public safety.,175,,
1217,0.97,5517.912,5520.481,"Our businesses, our community businesses got broke in many times.",175,,
1218,0.97,5520.481,5529.69,And we bring this up many times from the beginning before they bring these services to our community.,175,,
1219,0.97,5529.69,5530.091,We informed them.,175,,
1220,0.97,5530.091,5532.827,"We asked them for the plan, the mitigation.",175,,
1221,0.97,5532.827,5533.928,But it has no plan.,175,,
1222,0.97,5533.928,5544.005,"And we are suffering right now, with the community are afraid to come to--you know, to go to those businesses.",175,,
1223,0.97,5544.005,5544.405,Thank you.,176,,
1224,0.97,5544.405,5549.277,I know that that is an issue that we need to keep addressing.,176,,
1225,0.97,5549.277,5551.979,We need to wrap in Table up.,177,,
1226,0.97,5551.979,5553.014,Just real quickly?,178,,
1227,0.97,5553.014,5553.281,Yeah.,179,,
1228,0.97,5553.281,5555.149,We got 20 minutes for the last group.,179,,
1229,0.97,5555.149,5555.917,So --,179,,
1230,0.97,5555.917,5556.183,Yeah.,180,,
1231,0.97,5556.183,5567.762,"I just want to flag my interest, as it relates to Karen's point about different answers from different contacts with the city.",180,,
1232,0.97,5567.762,5576.07,The Office of economic development created a city wide advisory team specifically supposed to deal with that issue.,180,,
1233,0.97,5576.07,5578.372,So it's supposed to be across all departments.,180,,
1234,0.97,5578.372,5582.176,So we need to find out what is working and what's not working with that.,180,,
1235,0.97,5582.176,5600.061,"And to the point, um, related to, um, damages to, um, businesses associated with crime, we heard about, um, um, impacts to business associated with city Finance construction.",180,,
1236,0.97,5600.061,5612.273,"Again, the office of economic development has--is Piloting a business stabilization fund that is supposed to help businesses deal with those unanticipated impacts.",180,,
1237,0.97,5612.273,5620.581,"I think we really--I want to find out, um, what's working and what's not working, um, with that intervention as well.",180,,
1238,0.97,5620.581,5628.456,Because it is intended to do that if Maybe an instance of doesn't have sufficient resources.,180,,
1239,0.97,5628.456,5629.824,But we should find out more.,180,,
1240,0.97,5629.824,5632.293,Thank you all so much.,181,,
1241,0.97,5632.293,5634.261,So I'm going to call up the next group.,182,,
1242,0.97,5634.261,5645.539,"So the last group of folks are Beth Takekawa, lady Scribe, Jamil Suleman and Kamal Patel.",182,,
1243,0.97,5655.683,5659.52,Our in film round table on building community Welt.,183,,
1244,0.97,5659.52,5665.826,Briefing and discussion.,183,,
1245,0.97,5665.826,5666.26,"Hello, everyone.",184,,
1246,0.97,5666.26,5670.831,Thank you so much for being here.,184,,
1247,0.97,5670.831,5674.168,I am going to ask us to go around and introduce yourself.,184,,
1248,0.97,5674.168,5676.07,Your organization or the work you do.,184,,
1249,0.97,5676.07,5682.376,So we can get started and looking forward to conversation.,184,,
1250,0.97,5682.376,5684.211,I'm Beth Takekawa.,185,,
1251,0.97,5684.211,5691.552,I'm the executive director of the wing Luke museum.,185,,
1252,0.97,5691.552,5697.658,We are a cultural anchor and economic driver in the neighborhood.,185,,
1253,0.97,5697.658,5699.326,I know you only have a few minutes.,185,,
1254,0.97,5699.326,5707.301,But I thought your question was really good to ask about what is an example has worked with the city.,185,,
1255,0.97,5707.301,5716.277,And I too want to give a shout out to the whole E.D.I.,185,,
1256,0.97,5716.277,5716.577,Initiative.,185,,
1257,0.97,5716.577,5743.037,"And maybe, starting before the formation of E.D.I., on the policy level, I appreciate that the race and social equity Tak force, that the city invested in working with 3 different communities so I don't know that we would have the resources to work together.",185,,
1258,0.97,5743.037,5752.346,So it was the Dpd at the time and the office of civil rights that.,185,,
1259,0.97,5752.346,5755.249,And so we worked on the COMP plan.,185,,
1260,0.97,5755.249,5756.984,We didn't have experience with doing that.,185,,
1261,0.97,5756.984,5759.353,Even the language that was used in the COMP plan.,185,,
1262,0.97,5759.353,5763.257,Then it led to the formation of E.D.I.,185,,
1263,0.97,5763.257,5764.425,That is one thing.,185,,
1264,0.97,5764.425,5770.297,The other thing I really like is the office of arts and culture.,185,,
1265,0.97,5770.297,5776.17,The building arts spaces equitably.,185,,
1266,0.97,5776.17,5791.285,Which a lot of members of our community are involved in and the goal to try to develop an army of people who are professionals at the intersection of arts.,185,,
1267,0.97,5791.285,5796.657,And commercial real estate is very bold.,185,,
1268,0.97,5796.657,5803.297,"And again, somebody actually didn't just talk about it but invested in it.",185,,
1269,0.97,5803.297,5809.003,"So having said that, the Army is ready.",185,,
1270,0.97,5809.003,5815.242,We need experience and without opportunity you can't get.,185,,
1271,0.97,5815.242,5816.01,Thank you.,185,,
1272,0.97,5816.01,5817.978,"We're just doing Intros, right?",186,,
1273,0.97,5817.978,5818.813,Yes.,187,,
1274,0.97,5818.813,5820.748,"I had a little presentation, too.",188,,
1275,0.97,5820.748,5822.683,So should I just say who I am?,188,,
1276,0.97,5822.683,5823.284,Yeah.,189,,
1277,0.97,5823.284,5823.918,Just are for now.,189,,
1278,0.97,5823.918,5825.886,My name is Kamal.,190,,
1279,0.97,5825.886,5827.421,I'm a designer.,190,,
1280,0.97,5827.421,5828.122,Digital technology as well.,190,,
1281,0.97,5828.122,5837.331,"I work at the city of Seattle, King County, various corporations as well.",190,,
1282,0.97,5837.331,5838.632,I'm lady Scribe.,191,,
1283,0.97,5838.632,5842.536,I am the founder of the Seattle sound music awards.,191,,
1284,0.97,5842.536,5854.348,"And I am the daughter of Charringa, who owned the first black modeling agency in the Pacific Northwest on the corner of 23rd and Jackson for over 30 years.",191,,
1285,0.97,5854.348,5859.453,So we're just happy to be able to be heard today.,191,,
1286,0.97,5859.453,5860.754,Thank you.,192,,
1287,0.97,5860.754,5862.423,My name is Jamil Suleman.,193,,
1288,0.97,5862.423,5867.528,"I am a Filmmaker, performer and youth worker from South Seattle.",193,,
1289,0.97,5867.528,5871.398,And I am the co-owner of Indy genius media.,193,,
1290,0.97,5871.398,5871.966,Thank you.,194,,
1291,0.97,5871.966,5876.07,"Again, I have a couple of Open- ended questions.",194,,
1292,0.97,5876.07,5880.841,"And I'm interested in hearing from all of you, about your experience working with the city.",194,,
1293,0.97,5880.841,5887.081,"Or for your industry, what we need to be doing to help support the work that you do.",194,,
1294,0.97,5887.081,5888.582,So that's the question.,194,,
1295,0.97,5888.582,5889.283,The first question.,194,,
1296,0.97,5889.283,5892.82,How can we support artists and Filmmakers to stay in the city?,194,,
1297,0.97,5892.82,5894.989,I know you talked about this a little bit.,194,,
1298,0.97,5894.989,5900.16,"Just the industry kind of leaving the city of Seattle over the last 20, 30 years.",194,,
1299,0.97,5900.16,5904.098,And what does a thriving economy look like?,194,,
1300,0.97,5904.098,5906.2,For artists and Creatives and Filmmakers?,194,,
1301,0.97,5906.2,5917.311,And how do we make sure that we are providing the sort of infrastructure and support so that those folks can continue to stay in the city.,194,,
1302,0.97,5917.311,5923.117,Just to echo what a lot of other folks said up to this point.,195,,
1303,0.97,5923.117,5927.621,"We're dealing with essentially the same kind of issue, which is displacement.",195,,
1304,0.97,5927.621,5931.258,As a Filmmaker in South Seattle.,195,,
1305,0.97,5931.258,5935.129,"We are constantly every story that I'm covering, whether it be for the city.",195,,
1306,0.97,5935.129,5938.332,And whether it be for a nonprofit.,195,,
1307,0.97,5938.332,5941.035,It's always displacement and the lack of jobs.,195,,
1308,0.97,5941.035,5943.671,So that's the story that is being told.,195,,
1309,0.97,5943.671,5946.407,That's the story we're covering as Filmmakers.,195,,
1310,0.97,5946.407,5954.114,"Now, I'm hearing that there's a lot of money now, hopefully coming into the creative circles of Seattle.",195,,
1311,0.97,5954.114,5957.318,"And the Disconnect from my experience, and again, I worked with the city.",195,,
1312,0.97,5957.318,5959.62,I worked for the Mayor's office.,195,,
1313,0.97,5959.62,5965.826,I worked for the Seattle music Commission.,195,,
1314,0.97,5965.826,5967.294,There's so much bureaucracy.,195,,
1315,0.97,5967.294,5972.333,And there's--similar to what Wyking said earlier.,195,,
1316,0.97,5972.333,5973.567,Top down Disconnection.,195,,
1317,0.97,5973.567,5975.469,That anything really effective gets washed out.,195,,
1318,0.97,5975.469,5977.938,And it looks just really ineffective.,195,,
1319,0.97,5977.938,5979.873,I don't know how to put it other than that.,195,,
1320,0.97,5979.873,5982.209,And I'm not trying to be particularly offensive.,195,,
1321,0.97,5982.209,5983.978,It's just that I work for the city.,195,,
1322,0.97,5983.978,5989.917,"And I'm like, I have clients who are a small business who are more responsive than the city.",195,,
1323,0.97,5989.917,5991.719,"Than the Mayor's office, even.",195,,
1324,0.97,5991.719,5995.789,And you're paying me money to make your content to put it out there.,195,,
1325,0.97,5995.789,5997.958,And it doesn't even go out.,195,,
1326,0.97,5997.958,6001.962,You just wasted taxpayers money to make content.,195,,
1327,0.97,6001.962,6009.703,We'll make it for you but it's unfair to us and to you guys and the taxpayer.,195,,
1328,0.97,6009.703,6013.507,There's a lot of there's a lot of issues with these organizations.,195,,
1329,0.97,6013.507,6015.776,And I know they're underfunded and people are Maxed out.,195,,
1330,0.97,6015.776,6022.116,I don't think we need another mixer.,195,,
1331,0.97,6022.116,6022.816,Those are great.,195,,
1332,0.97,6022.816,6025.686,I will say this.,195,,
1333,0.97,6025.686,6028.522,We're super short on time.,195,,
1334,0.97,6028.522,6039.199,"I will say that a lot of the youth of color that I've worked with as a worker in South Seattle, create Video, create film.",195,,
1335,0.97,6039.199,6041.902,They create the most innovative film to come out of Seattle.,195,,
1336,0.97,6041.902,6044.004,They're getting the most views.,195,,
1337,0.97,6044.004,6044.638,Getting the most attention.,195,,
1338,0.97,6044.638,6047.241,Getting pulled to Los Angeles.,195,,
1339,0.97,6047.241,6048.776,Getting pulled everywhere else.,195,,
1340,0.97,6048.776,6053.113,"They're not being invested into here, in their own region.",195,,
1341,0.97,6053.113,6054.748,That's what we're starting to see.,195,,
1342,0.97,6054.748,6060.12,"Hopefully we will start to see real programs, getting young people of color in the Union.",195,,
1343,0.97,6060.12,6066.293,"Getting them in the Union at a young age, in high schools at a job that they can come out and get into.",195,,
1344,0.97,6066.293,6067.795,There's a lot going on.,195,,
1345,0.97,6067.795,6069.963,We lost film.,195,,
1346,0.97,6069.963,6070.831,Years ago.,195,,
1347,0.97,6070.831,6072.666,To Portland and Vancouver.,195,,
1348,0.97,6072.666,6074.034,And we chose up on Tech.,195,,
1349,0.97,6074.034,6081.975,And that kind of allowed other cities to kind of take the lead on that because they didn't have big Tech to invest in.,195,,
1350,0.97,6081.975,6085.946,So but now everybody wants to come back to Seattle.,195,,
1351,0.97,6085.946,6088.215,So it's simultaneously exciting and exhausting.,195,,
1352,0.97,6088.215,6090.784,"At the same time, just trying to balance it all.",195,,
1353,0.97,6090.784,6094.087,And we've worked alongside a lot of you folks.,195,,
1354,0.97,6094.087,6097.491,Yeah.,196,,
1355,0.97,6097.491,6102.696,I think it's about ensuring that voices put forward.,197,,
1356,0.97,6102.696,6106.9,And that the resources are there.,197,,
1357,0.97,6106.9,6107.234,Consistent.,197,,
1358,0.97,6107.234,6109.736,It's not just a Playication.,197,,
1359,0.97,6109.736,6116.877,"A lot of times it Turps out like come to the meeting, talk a few minutes and I'll see you in a year.",197,,
1360,0.97,6116.877,6119.68,And nothing really tangible gets done.,197,,
1361,0.97,6119.68,6130.824,"So I'm hoping we can really, you know, figure that out and get people involved in the grass levels.",197,,
1362,0.97,6130.824,6132.526,I'm trying to combine this.,198,,
1363,0.97,6132.526,6142.236,But I do want to say that outside of the awards that I am just a Seattle resident.,198,,
1364,0.97,6142.236,6145.939,We were pushed out my mother lost her home.,198,,
1365,0.97,6145.939,6147.908,I was raised in Mount Baker.,198,,
1366,0.97,6147.908,6152.446,She was also priced out of her business at 2214 South Jackson.,198,,
1367,0.97,6152.446,6155.349,She didn't even go in that area anymore.,198,,
1368,0.97,6155.349,6160.654,I remember conducting the development and asking if they would be willing to do some legacy space.,198,,
1369,0.97,6160.654,6164.291,So we can just occupy something there.,198,,
1370,0.97,6164.291,6170.931,"Then once they heard what we wanted, they just disconnected and stopped returning any calls and E-Mails.",198,,
1371,0.97,6170.931,6176.737,You guys do have the ability to occupy Southeast Seattle.,198,,
1372,0.97,6176.737,6184.278,"And that's definitely what we want is a creative space to be able to you know, create.",198,,
1373,0.97,6184.278,6187.281,We are always in different Clubbings.,198,,
1374,0.97,6187.281,6189.55,This is our 7th year.,198,,
1375,0.97,6189.55,6193.453,"Producing a red carpet, L.A.",198,,
1376,0.97,6193.453,6193.787,Awards level.,198,,
1377,0.97,6193.787,6198.625,But we are making other clubs that have no interest in dealing with black people.,198,,
1378,0.97,6198.625,6200.36,Or any minorities at all.,198,,
1379,0.97,6200.36,6202.095,"They just want the liquor, right?",198,,
1380,0.97,6202.095,6206.667,And the sales to keep it open.,198,,
1381,0.97,6206.667,6207.234,So we're dealing with that.,198,,
1382,0.97,6207.234,6208.035,We have to come into these spaces.,198,,
1383,0.97,6208.035,6208.769,Produce our show.,198,,
1384,0.97,6208.769,6211.305,And be treated a certain kind of way.,198,,
1385,0.97,6211.305,6216.41,But that's what we've succumbed to and are used to in Seattle.,198,,
1386,0.97,6216.41,6217.211,As far as resources.,198,,
1387,0.97,6217.211,6217.878,I was thinking.,198,,
1388,0.97,6217.878,6219.313,"Like I said, I'm just a resident.",198,,
1389,0.97,6219.313,6223.717,I don't know all of Theseedges agencies and all of that.,198,,
1390,0.97,6223.717,6226.62,"So I'm like, how do I get plugged in?",198,,
1391,0.97,6226.62,6232.426,If I'm black Seattle and I'm not part of Africatown.,198,,
1392,0.97,6232.426,6233.427,"Like Hey, Wyking.",198,,
1393,0.97,6233.427,6236.029,I know him.,198,,
1394,0.97,6236.029,6236.597,But my neighbor doesn't.,198,,
1395,0.97,6236.597,6238.832,I was just back to District 2.,198,,
1396,0.97,6238.832,6240.334,I was forced out.,198,,
1397,0.97,6240.334,6241.835,And just able to come back home.,198,,
1398,0.97,6241.835,6246.64,And just to see how my city is changed.,198,,
1399,0.97,6246.64,6247.574,And the dynamic is Hurtful.,198,,
1400,0.97,6247.574,6252.546,And not even to have a black voice on the Council meeting.,198,,
1401,0.97,6252.546,6253.046,You talked.,198,,
1402,0.97,6253.046,6253.513,I met you.,198,,
1403,0.97,6253.513,6256.35,And I said out loud and put it on our social media.,198,,
1404,0.97,6256.35,6265.559,"That I really Dobl that you do have our best interest in voicing what black owners, whether it's business owners or homeowners.",198,,
1405,0.97,6265.559,6269.563,Because we are literally in fear of being erased.,198,,
1406,0.97,6269.563,6269.863,Seriously.,198,,
1407,0.97,6269.863,6273.166,"And our youth are, too.",198,,
1408,0.97,6273.166,6277.738,So the Seattletown music awards was not Seattle Hip-Hop awards on purpose.,198,,
1409,0.97,6277.738,6280.173,Because I come from Grunge.,198,,
1410,0.97,6280.173,6281.875,I love heart and def Leppard.,198,,
1411,0.97,6281.875,6286.046,But I realized my kids listen to Hip-Hop.,198,,
1412,0.97,6286.046,6289.349,And all of these young people doing R & amp; B.,198,,
1413,0.97,6289.349,6291.585,"And I'm like, Okay, Y'all.",198,,
1414,0.97,6291.585,6293.754,We could put something together to acknowledge you.,198,,
1415,0.97,6293.754,6297.391,"But we were not acknowledged in the Seattle sound, what is known globally.",198,,
1416,0.97,6297.391,6298.892,And I want that do change.,198,,
1417,0.97,6298.892,6304.798,"I want Seattle sound to Reglect urban music makers, right?",198,,
1418,0.97,6304.798,6305.966,In our platforms.,198,,
1419,0.97,6305.966,6306.7,We encompass everyone.,198,,
1420,0.97,6306.7,6313.807,But they're all urban music makers who get no love in any of the nightclub.,198,,
1421,0.97,6313.807,6314.241,"You know, nothing.",198,,
1422,0.97,6314.241,6316.81,Any nightclubs to keep in mind.,198,,
1423,0.97,6316.81,6321.415,That play Hip-Hop and R & amp; B are being sanctioned with fees.,198,,
1424,0.97,6321.415,6323.183,Insurance rates go up.,198,,
1425,0.97,6323.183,6325.218,So a lot of the owners --,198,,
1426,0.97,6325.218,6326.219,Wait.,199,,
1427,0.97,6326.219,6327.254,Say that again?,199,,
1428,0.97,6327.254,6328.355,Their insurance?,199,,
1429,0.97,6328.355,6328.622,Yeah.,200,,
1430,0.97,6328.622,6332.693,Their insurance rate goes up if they're playing R & amp; B and Hip- hop.,200,,
1431,0.97,6332.693,6335.629,Their license for liquor gets patrolled.,200,,
1432,0.97,6335.629,6337.197,Like why are you playing this music?,200,,
1433,0.97,6337.197,6341.368,To the point that they deter us from even booking with them.,200,,
1434,0.97,6341.368,6342.969,"We're like, sorry, we can't.",200,,
1435,0.97,6342.969,6343.537,Because it's Hip-Hop.,200,,
1436,0.97,6343.537,6346.84,And I think that's something that hasn't been discussed.,200,,
1437,0.97,6346.84,6368.395,"And then just the short and sweet of it, I was thinking, when a couple of community members, a line of business credit for small businesses and artists and entrepreneurs, despite their past personal credit right?",200,,
1438,0.97,6368.395,6371.198,"If the city can help us get funding, right?",200,,
1439,0.97,6371.198,6386.246,"And get us in a position to fund our projects with a line of business credit, then we can also move on with that, with workshops and tangible resources that are Trending on credit restoration.",200,,
1440,0.97,6386.246,6386.713,Right?,200,,
1441,0.97,6386.713,6390.283,"So now you guys say, we're not looking at your past personal.",200,,
1442,0.97,6390.283,6392.185,We're going to--like you said.,200,,
1443,0.97,6392.185,6394.855,The city has already lost money doing stuff.,200,,
1444,0.97,6394.855,6397.29,"Why not take a chance on, you know, us.",200,,
1445,0.97,6397.29,6399.626,And give us that line of credit.,200,,
1446,0.97,6399.626,6406.533,Along with the support to walk us through how to restore credit.,200,,
1447,0.97,6406.533,6410.737,"Keep tracking so you can see the growth of our credit, right?",200,,
1448,0.97,6410.737,6416.877,"And then be able to introduce how to purchase, you know, real estate.",200,,
1449,0.97,6416.877,6420.614,We don't know the funding available.,200,,
1450,0.97,6420.614,6422.115,We don't know the steps.,200,,
1451,0.97,6422.115,6430.19,But why don't you guys open an office in Southeast Seattle in where you can hold these types of meeting close to us.,200,,
1452,0.97,6430.19,6434.494,"If I would have missed an Email, I would have missed this, right?",200,,
1453,0.97,6434.494,6436.963,How are we getting our voices out?,200,,
1454,0.97,6436.963,6441.535,We're not even advertising to the community that this is for.,200,,
1455,0.97,6441.535,6442.335,Uh-huh.,201,,
1456,0.97,6442.335,6445.705,"If they would have known, they would have been here.",202,,
1457,0.97,6445.705,6446.006,I promise.,202,,
1458,0.97,6446.006,6448.809,It's just how do we--I'm so emotional.,202,,
1459,0.97,6448.809,6456.149,"How do we talk to the lack of Seattle that is there, black Seattle that is struggling.",202,,
1460,0.97,6456.149,6456.449,It is hard.,202,,
1461,0.97,6456.449,6457.918,I appreciate that.,203,,
1462,0.97,6457.918,6458.251,Thank you.,203,,
1463,0.97,6458.251,6461.922,And we will definitely do a better job next time of.,203,,
1464,0.97,6461.922,6469.362,We are trying to talk about trying to have these sorts Ofmeetings in the district.,203,,
1465,0.97,6469.362,6475.235,So that people don't have to try to come downtown at 5:00 to try to talk to their city Councilmember.,203,,
1466,0.97,6475.235,6475.702,So I appreciate that.,203,,
1467,0.97,6475.702,6477.137,All right.,204,,
1468,0.97,6477.137,6477.37,Thanks.,204,,
1469,0.97,6477.37,6480.64,So I'm going to talk as a designer in the technology world.,204,,
1470,0.97,6480.64,6487.08,A lot of the problems facing us is that we're mostly faced with Extractive business models as a designer.,204,,
1471,0.97,6487.08,6493.286,So the things we're building and designing are extracting wealth from the communities we're trying to support.,204,,
1472,0.97,6493.286,6507.067,"So what we want to do--what we're trying to do as designers in general is organize around a more Regenerative business models, ones that don't just throw things in the garbage, like a linear economy.",204,,
1473,0.97,6507.067,6513.106,But that kind of think of waste as a resource in our communities.,204,,
1474,0.97,6513.106,6520.814,"And so I want to name two, three main projects with two strategies.",204,,
1475,0.97,6520.814,6524.284,One is procurement as a way to build wealth and communities.,204,,
1476,0.97,6524.284,6534.494,So large institutions like hospitals and universities and large businesses buying from businesses of color and helping build wealth there.,204,,
1477,0.97,6534.494,6538.865,And that's a project the city of Seattle that I'll explain in a second.,204,,
1478,0.97,6538.865,6545.005,And the second is moving from a linear economy to a Regenerative one.,204,,
1479,0.97,6545.005,6547.807,With a just transition framework.,204,,
1480,0.97,6547.807,6550.243,So that those resource wealth goes back to the community that it's from.,204,,
1481,0.97,6550.243,6556.316,So the first project with the office of economic development is what I'm a designer on.,204,,
1482,0.97,6556.316,6559.085,"With a story, too.",204,,
1483,0.97,6559.085,6568.261,"A community, Cooperatively owned P.O.C.-Owned design agency in Seattle, working with Bobby Lee at the office of economic development.",204,,
1484,0.97,6568.261,6572.432,And we are building something connective.,204,,
1485,0.97,6572.432,6574.034,And location was there.,204,,
1486,0.97,6574.034,6575.835,Africatown.,204,,
1487,0.97,6575.835,6576.069,Avole.,204,,
1488,0.97,6576.069,6588.281,And we basically are doing a Codesigned methodology to design a procurement tool to help large institutions buy from these small businesses of color.,204,,
1489,0.97,6588.281,6590.85,But that procurement piece is really important.,204,,
1490,0.97,6590.85,6594.154,Because it's an anchor strategy.,204,,
1491,0.97,6594.154,6597.257,It's using community wealth to build community wealth.,204,,
1492,0.97,6597.257,6605.065,"A model that we're also looking at, this is a separate project, is called the Boston Ijimma project.",204,,
1493,0.97,6605.065,6622.315,And they basically are using community ownership to create an entire circular economy around food from the compost system to the farms to the growers to the restaurants and then back to the waste and then back to the farm.,204,,
1494,0.97,6622.315,6625.952,U-J-I-M-A . So we're using that model on Vashon Island right now.,204,,
1495,0.97,6625.952,6632.926,And physically building a Digester that is going to be Community-Owned by the Vashon farmers.,204,,
1496,0.97,6632.926,6647.607,"It Digests food waste, turns it into compost water and Biogas that is actually going to be charging a truck that the move the water to a Community-Owned land trust farm called like Pseudofarms on Vashon.",204,,
1497,0.97,6647.607,6653.78,"And then that will go to a school, which will buy the food, and then that waste will go back to the Digester.",204,,
1498,0.97,6653.78,6656.282,And you have a complete circle.,204,,
1499,0.97,6656.282,6660.787,What I'm proposing is that we basically do the same models in Rainier valley.,204,,
1500,0.97,6660.787,6664.224,And they have the largest farm in Seattle.,204,,
1501,0.97,6664.224,6668.328,They have the Rainier food district going on.,204,,
1502,0.97,6668.328,6668.728,Obviously Arback.,204,,
1503,0.97,6668.728,6671.131,So how do we Replicate those models?,204,,
1504,0.97,6671.131,6674.3,And we're already doing it through King County's help and Seattle.,204,,
1505,0.97,6674.3,6677.17,So thank you.,204,,
1506,0.97,6677.17,6678.772,I'm sorry.,205,,
1507,0.97,6678.772,6679.072,I didn't.,205,,
1508,0.97,6679.072,6679.272,Yeah.,205,,
1509,0.97,6679.272,6681.975,"You can look at those Graphics, too.",205,,
1510,0.97,6681.975,6682.275,Okay.,206,,
1511,0.97,6682.275,6683.243,Thank you.,206,,
1512,0.97,6683.243,6683.91,Apologies.,207,,
1513,0.97,6683.91,6684.21,I didn't --,207,,
1514,0.97,6684.21,6685.145,"No, that's great.",208,,
1515,0.97,6685.145,6688.481,My E-mail is on there as well.,209,,
1516,0.97,6688.481,6688.815,Terrific.,210,,
1517,0.97,6688.815,6689.115,Thank you.,210,,
1518,0.97,6689.115,6694.187,"And remember, procurement is a key piece of that whole puzzle.",211,,
1519,0.97,6694.187,6694.888,Yeah.,212,,
1520,0.97,6694.888,6698.358,"Beth, did you want to Chime in?",213,,
1521,0.97,6698.358,6704.631,"Well, I did want to say what a thriving economy would look like.",214,,
1522,0.97,6704.631,6711.137,"First of all, I really appreciate that artists and the arts is that this table.",214,,
1523,0.97,6711.137,6713.506,And the topic of building community wealth.,214,,
1524,0.97,6713.506,6723.817,"One thing we know is all the communities of color, we've kind of banded together.",214,,
1525,0.97,6723.817,6726.586,We're where we are because of red lining.,214,,
1526,0.97,6726.586,6733.026,"And now that we've built our communities, now we're the ones most in danger of getting pushed out.",214,,
1527,0.97,6733.026,6737.897,"And one thing is, there are historic cultural assets in every one of our communities.",214,,
1528,0.97,6737.897,6742.936,"And--I mean, aren't assets that we have to harness.",214,,
1529,0.97,6742.936,6751.077,"The thing about the arts is that oftentimes, our artists and arts are not looked at as arts.",214,,
1530,0.97,6751.077,6752.579,It's looked at as diversity.,214,,
1531,0.97,6752.579,6755.081,So the arts has to be redefined.,214,,
1532,0.97,6755.081,6760.153,Because a lot of the artists from our communities are the ones on the cutting edge.,214,,
1533,0.97,6760.153,6766.259,And so what is artistic excellence?,214,,
1534,0.97,6766.259,6766.96,What is the arts?,214,,
1535,0.97,6766.96,6769.429,That a lot of change has to take place.,214,,
1536,0.97,6769.429,6779.672,"So you've all mentioned, you know, the need for resources, the need for technical assistance, for lines of credit.",215,,
1537,0.97,6779.672,6788.715,"I wonder if there are other--Jamil, you talked about needing to invest in young people.",215,,
1538,0.97,6788.715,6794.12,Can you talk a little popular about what you mean when you say resources and what that would look like?,215,,
1539,0.97,6794.12,6794.554,Yeah.,216,,
1540,0.97,6794.554,6798.658,I think there are three real tangible things that we can do.,216,,
1541,0.97,6798.658,6803.396,"Like right away, and the city can get acting on.",216,,
1542,0.97,6803.396,6809.502,"One is,--one is getting Union training for youth of color in high school.",216,,
1543,0.97,6809.502,6809.969,In film.,216,,
1544,0.97,6809.969,6812.272,So whether it be their S.A.G.,216,,
1545,0.97,6812.272,6816.576,"Card, if they want to be an actor.",216,,
1546,0.97,6816.576,6818.578,Whether it be a production kind of Union.,216,,
1547,0.97,6818.578,6823.183,A lot of young people of color love to create content.,216,,
1548,0.97,6823.183,6829.289,But they're not thinking about it in a way to sustain a career path.,216,,
1549,0.97,6829.289,6831.691,They're just hoping to go viral.,216,,
1550,0.97,6831.691,6837.463,What my 12-year-old son says.,217,,
1551,0.97,6837.463,6837.764,Exactly.,218,,
1552,0.97,6837.764,6841.901,Until then they working at McDonald's.,218,,
1553,0.97,6841.901,6846.906,We want to give them assets to build their career path.,218,,
1554,0.97,6846.906,6849.142,Having Union training assets would be great.,218,,
1555,0.97,6849.142,6849.576,Especially young.,218,,
1556,0.97,6849.576,6856.249,It would be great to have P.A.S getting--youth of colors being P.A.S on film set.,218,,
1557,0.97,6856.249,6857.817,That's one thing.,218,,
1558,0.97,6857.817,6866.826,"The second thing is, if you are a Filmmaker or creative of color in South Seattle or Seattle, you might have a business license.",218,,
1559,0.97,6866.826,6871.764,"If you do, you probably are not O.M.W.B.E.",218,,
1560,0.97,6871.764,6885.044,"Certified, which allows you or grants you access to a less, where businesses and local government and Nonprofits can then source you and say, Okay, Yeah, we can actually, because there is some quota involved in some of this stuff.",218,,
1561,0.97,6885.044,6896.289,So if we can get these production Companyless and individual Freelancers to get themselves Omwb certified.,218,,
1562,0.97,6896.289,6898.191,That would assist them a lot as well.,218,,
1563,0.97,6898.191,6907.9,"And then Finally, with a bunch of creative coming into Seattle, there's a lot of professionals of color already in the industry.",218,,
1564,0.97,6907.9,6909.435,But we're scattered all over the place.,218,,
1565,0.97,6909.435,6918.511,"And a lot of times, it might be required for a production to hire people of color or women on board or on set.",218,,
1566,0.97,6918.511,6934.327,"So what we need is a roster, to some extent, a structured one, that maybe even is facilitated by or partnered with the city, of these Creatives of color who are, you know, Gaffing, lighting, sound design.",218,,
1567,0.97,6934.327,6936.796,"You know, so people can go to them.",218,,
1568,0.97,6936.796,6949.475,"Like if Ray big studio wants to work with more women, behind the glass, so to speak, so directors and writers and things like that, they have a roster that they can access locally.",218,,
1569,0.97,6949.475,6951.144,So those three things would be huge.,218,,
1570,0.97,6951.144,6953.713,It would take a lot of work and a lot of organizing.,218,,
1571,0.97,6953.713,6956.282,But you guys are so good at that.,218,,
1572,0.97,6956.282,6962.989,"Well, and you talked about, you know, having a business license but not knowing the next step might be to get this certification.",219,,
1573,0.97,6962.989,6965.658,Which I think is a really important point.,219,,
1574,0.97,6965.658,6977.67,"And you know, my experience knowing a couple of Djs who are becoming popular but are still giving away their CDs instead of charging for them.",219,,
1575,0.97,6977.67,6981.407,"Just the understanding of, you're trying to run a business.",219,,
1576,0.97,6981.407,6981.975,Like you're an artist.,219,,
1577,0.97,6981.975,6992.318,"But if you're trying to actually make a living out of this, then there's some things you need to know about how to run a business and providing that kind of technical assistance as well.",219,,
1578,0.97,6992.318,6992.985,Right.,220,,
1579,0.97,6992.985,6993.453,Adventures does that.,220,,
1580,0.97,6993.453,6995.054,Is an organization that does it very well.,220,,
1581,0.97,6995.054,6997.79,But they can't do it by themselves.,220,,
1582,0.97,6997.79,7000.393,And they kind of take a lot of weight.,220,,
1583,0.97,7000.393,7001.394,So giving them assistance.,220,,
1584,0.97,7001.394,7004.797,"Yeah, I think another thing, too, is assisting programs that already exist.",220,,
1585,0.97,7004.797,7009.435,I would hate to recreate the wheel and kind of Rob the people of the work that they have been doing.,220,,
1586,0.97,7009.435,7013.906,So maybe doing some research and finding out who is already doing this stuff.,220,,
1587,0.97,7013.906,7015.975,Give them more incentives and funding.,220,,
1588,0.97,7015.975,7020.38,"I just wanted to say, the point of running the business.",221,,
1589,0.97,7020.38,7030.123,"That is where I wanted to make sure that I explained it well, that the line of business credit, not a grant.",221,,
1590,0.97,7030.123,7037.029,"The reason being is because we need this business credit, in order to do the things moving forward.",221,,
1591,0.97,7037.029,7041.401,"We need our personal credit to be--you know, in order to move forward.",221,,
1592,0.97,7041.401,7042.602,That hinders a lot of us.,221,,
1593,0.97,7042.602,7044.637,And we don't have.,221,,
1594,0.97,7044.637,7045.938,We're trying to self diagnose.,221,,
1595,0.97,7045.938,7053.446,"Learn how to--you know, we don't have that and run the business and, you know, applying for all of these resources.",221,,
1596,0.97,7053.446,7053.913,Hurting your credit.,221,,
1597,0.97,7053.913,7054.18,You know.,221,,
1598,0.97,7054.18,7058.151,But we have the resources here to lend.,221,,
1599,0.97,7058.151,7059.986,"You know, and train.",221,,
1600,0.97,7059.986,7062.555,"So therefore, you know, our kids.",221,,
1601,0.97,7062.555,7064.924,They need to be just like you said in high school.,221,,
1602,0.97,7064.924,7065.858,Those are the things.,221,,
1603,0.97,7065.858,7068.327,Those are the ages.,221,,
1604,0.97,7068.327,7073.766,"Even as Younguns middle school, when it comes to taking care of your credit, and what that looks like.",221,,
1605,0.97,7073.766,7075.668,Even farm to table.,221,,
1606,0.97,7075.668,7081.908,"I tell my kids all the time, I don't even know if you can grow anything if it was an actual disaster.",221,,
1607,0.97,7081.908,7084.577,You would still be looking for Wifi.,221,,
1608,0.97,7084.577,7085.545,Like for Reals.,221,,
1609,0.97,7085.545,7088.881,Or flavored hot Cheetos.,222,,
1610,0.97,7088.881,7089.148,Right.,223,,
1611,0.97,7089.148,7090.55,"So it's like, we're talking about it.",223,,
1612,0.97,7090.55,7096.889,"But we're not giving those tangible resources that people this is it ., okay.",223,,
1613,0.97,7096.889,7099.992,You can direct a person to a Website.,223,,
1614,0.97,7099.992,7101.094,Or you can have a form.,223,,
1615,0.97,7101.094,7104.73,But no one is really going back to that and training themselves.,223,,
1616,0.97,7104.73,7112.605,"But if we can come to a place that is organized and says, even if we come in and pick up the pamphlet, right?",223,,
1617,0.97,7112.605,7114.207,Or come in and ask the question.,223,,
1618,0.97,7114.207,7118.778,And figure out and talk to someone who is designated to us.,223,,
1619,0.97,7118.778,7120.246,And say the business.,223,,
1620,0.97,7120.246,7120.546,Or credit.,223,,
1621,0.97,7120.546,7122.081,What can we do?,223,,
1622,0.97,7122.081,7125.151,"That would give so much empowerment, too.",223,,
1623,0.97,7125.151,7126.352,Instead of feeling voiceless.,223,,
1624,0.97,7126.352,7127.086,We can't do this.,223,,
1625,0.97,7127.086,7128.421,We can't do this.,223,,
1626,0.97,7128.421,7130.923,"You know, we don't have a grant writer.",223,,
1627,0.97,7130.923,7132.658,We don't know how to access these funds.,223,,
1628,0.97,7132.658,7135.495,But I think that is just so important.,223,,
1629,0.97,7135.495,7136.729,Because it's like sure.,223,,
1630,0.97,7136.729,7137.864,You want money?,223,,
1631,0.97,7137.864,7138.064,Here.,223,,
1632,0.97,7138.064,7139.131,Let's give you this.,223,,
1633,0.97,7139.131,7143.803,But you're not telling me and helping me grow my business credit or personal credit.,223,,
1634,0.97,7143.803,7144.07,Yeah.,224,,
1635,0.97,7144.07,7145.938,We want to buy homes here.,225,,
1636,0.97,7145.938,7147.64,We want to live here.,225,,
1637,0.97,7147.64,7149.208,You know?,225,,
1638,0.97,7149.208,7149.575,Absolutely.,226,,
1639,0.97,7149.575,7151.911,We are out of time.,227,,
1640,0.97,7151.911,7154.413,I'm sure we could carry this on for a long time.,227,,
1641,0.97,7154.413,7161.721,"Thank you all for coming, for staying late, for sharing your experiences and your stories and your expertise.",227,,
1642,0.97,7161.721,7165.124,This is the beginning of a conversation.,227,,
1643,0.97,7165.124,7179.839,"So as I said before, my hope is that we use this committee as a platform for having these conversations and sharing information and understanding better what we can do to make sure that folks stop getting pushed out and are able to stay and thrive.",227,,
1644,0.97,7179.839,7181.541,Bring food next time.,228,,
1645,0.97,7181.541,7184.977,I will see what I can do.,229,,
1646,0.97,7184.977,7185.545,Thank you so much.,230,,
1647,0.97,7185.545,7189.949,"If there are no more comments, questions.",231,,
1648,0.97,7189.949,7193.953,This committee is adjourned.,231,,
