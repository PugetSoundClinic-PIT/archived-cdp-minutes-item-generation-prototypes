402,0.97,2109.407,2178.843,"As I believe you know, the Seattle rim has been a asset for its entire life it is part of our parks system and, in 2009 this city entered into an agreement to have the Aquarium society take over the Day-To- day operation of that building and they have been able to really and the public programming and expand the public benefit to expand the programming and exhibit tree to really show Marine Ecology, the challenges we are facing with ocean Acidification their programming here at these panel Aquarium work that has taken the form of manic called the ocean pavilion we have been able to break this into the waterfront design.",50,,
403,0.97,2178.843,2189.053,It is going to provide a critical piece of the infrastructure of the object connecting were of Pike place get to the new waterfront.,50,,
404,0.97,2189.053,2192.29,We really are very integrated with the Aquarium society.,50,,
405,0.97,2192.29,2200.298,"This deals with the ocean pavilion, links to the overlooked walk which we are going to talk about and Councilmember Lewis alluded to this.",50,,
406,0.97,2200.298,2211.475,The third piece of what has provided value to the here is bringing these two projects together and putting the Aquarium at the heart of the waterfront.,50,,
407,0.97,2211.475,2213.01,This has allowed us to really hate schedule.,50,,
408,0.97,2213.01,2222.42,We have this project really happening hand and glove with each other.,50,,
409,0.97,2222.42,2226.457,We are able to deliver the new ocean pavilion as part of an integrated whole with this city's project slide.,50,,
410,0.97,2226.457,2234.465,"I will not go through all of this is kind of gives you at a glance, just a sense of the depth of the working relationship.",50,,
411,0.97,2234.465,2261.926,"You can starting in 2009 the city's essentially authorizing a transition to the a frame society and setting up an operation's agreement with them for the day-to-day operations of the and you know, in 2012-, we established that partnership to do that expansion in the waterfront vision.",50,,
412,0.97,2261.926,2268.132,"And then, as we move into 2017- 19, it is really putting in place the details of how we would execute there pavilion project is part of a larger waterfront design.",50,,
413,0.97,2268.132,2287.785,Also it deals with providing significant city support to enable project cost.,50,,
414,0.97,2287.785,2289.587,Then from the Aquarium will describe this in more detail.,50,,
415,0.97,2289.587,2300.064,"You will recall that in the initial funding agreement, that was the last item on the table that I just showed you.",50,,
416,0.97,2300.064,2304.168,That finalized a $34 million contribution from the city in order to support the completion of the project.,50,,
417,0.97,2304.168,2319.35,"And, that investment is equivalent to another invest made in the Pike place market to complete the market front Mansion which I am guessing most of you have probably seen.",50,,
418,0.97,2319.35,2321.419,It has been billed and it was finished in 2017.,50,,
419,0.97,2321.419,2329.26,This provides an incredible new front for the market connecting it to our new waterfront.,50,,
420,0.97,2329.26,2340.271,"Am critical things that the ocean pavilion is doing you know, in addition to the Aquarium's programming and exhibit tree and their public benefit, they are also providing some physical infrastructure that supports public and the city's vision.",50,,
421,0.97,2340.271,2345.976,I will talk about those in more detail in just a minute.,50,,
422,0.97,2345.976,2355.152,Where we are right now and while we are back here talk to about legislation is that the is a $20 million short-term tax flow funding need.,50,,
423,0.97,2355.152,2361.992,"They are in a position where they had seen some project costing, primarily associated Ith construction Co ovation, material cost asked ovation.",50,,
424,0.97,2361.992,2369.5,We have seen fundraising continuing to perform well.,50,,
425,0.97,2369.5,2370.768,There project is at 160 million.,50,,
426,0.97,2370.768,2376.807,It is about Percent- Philanthropy.,50,,
427,0.97,2376.807,2378.676,It is taking a little bit longer than anticipated.,50,,
428,0.97,2378.676,2399.13,"During Covid, we saw this thought there were parts of the waterfront Philanthropy, things slowed down a little bit in terms of private donation while people frankly, they were seen where the economy was going to go and where Seattle was going to go.",50,,
429,0.97,2399.13,2401.198,"Again, the Seattle quarantine can't speak more to this.",50,,
430,0.97,2401.198,2402.4,That campaign is continuing to perform well.,50,,
431,0.97,2402.4,2406.103,We are in careful due diligence with them on a regular basis.,50,,
432,0.97,2406.103,2410.007,There is a bit of a lack that has created a cash flow challenge for the a frame's object.,50,,
433,0.97,2410.007,2420.017,"And then Lastly, it is the discussion carefully at what are the full range of different tools the brain can bring to the table to address the Short- term cash flow need.",50,,
434,0.97,2420.017,2422.086,This is including debt.,50,,
435,0.97,2422.086,2424.722,This deals with collection of loans.,50,,
436,0.97,2424.722,2433.597,They Aquarium is a nonprofit organization . This makes it unique.,50,,
437,0.97,2433.597,2434.899,It is operating and maintaining city assets.,50,,
438,0.97,2434.899,2440.037,It does not have the Operability to users of collateral in the way that a private business or private property owner could use them.,50,,
439,0.97,2440.037,2452.383,"And so for all of those recent, we have been working with the of ram and we are now hoping that the city will provide the short-term cash flow support to the.",50,,
440,0.97,2452.383,2460.424,That would be essentially repaid by the Aryan over a period of about eight years.,50,,
441,0.97,2460.424,2467.932,Caleb is going to talk about that little bit more detail in just a few minutes.,50,,
442,0.97,2467.932,2468.165,Slide.,50,,
443,0.97,2468.165,2472.069,There is just a little bit more on the public benefit that is baked into the ocean pavilion project.,50,,
444,0.97,2472.069,2478.142,"You can, there is an elevation with a top public face connect to this city's overlooked walk project.",50,,
445,0.97,2478.142,2490.988,It connects Pike place walk market down to the waterfront.,50,,
446,0.97,2492.156,2493.691,That public rooftop will be a city park.,50,,
447,0.97,2493.691,2495.626,It will be operated as part of the waterfront.,50,,
448,0.97,2495.626,2498.295,It will be a critical public benefit that the a frame is providing.,50,,
449,0.97,2498.295,2501.532,There also providing the stair connections that you see on the left side of this image.,50,,
450,0.97,2501.532,2507.505,They are providing a public connection between the higher elevation of Pike place market and its connection and a lower elevation of the waterfront.,50,,
451,0.97,2507.505,2517.882,"And, critical to the project is elevator and tear on the right side of the diagram.",50,,
452,0.97,2517.882,2525.356,That elevator and stair provides a really important media accessible Pathway between the elevation of Pike place market and the new waterfront.,50,,
453,0.97,2525.422,2538.235,Ne of our key things on the new waterfront has been to price several new elevator and stair connections to try to media ask us across the project.,50,,
454,0.97,2538.235,2541.038,Next slide.,50,,
455,0.97,2541.038,2545.576,Now I am going to hand it over to Caleb to walk through the details of the legislation.,50,,
456,0.97,2545.576,2546.176,Thank you Marshall.,50,,
457,0.97,2546.176,2547.912,I am with the city budget office.,50,,
458,0.97,2547.912,2555.219,We have been working closely with on this deal.,50,,
459,0.97,2555.219,2561.692,This is a short-term Finance that we are working on.,50,,
460,0.97,2561.692,2566.463,It is actually two pieces of legislation on board.,50,,
461,0.97,2566.463,2573.17,First is dealing with the project appropriation.,50,,
462,0.97,2573.17,2579.944,"What this legislation would do is it would increase appropriations in the parks, Aquarium expansion project by $20 million.",50,,
463,0.97,2579.944,2586.05,It would do that through an Interfund loan that would test the cash this year.,50,,
464,0.97,2586.05,2590.955,This would provide cash flow for construction.,50,,
465,0.97,2590.955,2599.597,The companion bill that this amend is the operation's management agreement that the city has with the parts collection.,50,,
466,0.97,2599.597,2601.765,This runs through June 20 30.,50,,
467,0.97,2601.765,2610.741,In that Lma amendment we will add an enhanced facility lead.,50,,
468,0.97,2610.741,2640.204,This a monthly lease payment that the Aquarium will then make to this city in order to reinforce it for that $20 million additional contribution it will both amend the agreement that the office of the waterfront had with the city and then the Omk that the city had the parks Department.,50,,
469,0.97,2640.204,2646.377,We structured it so that this would be a monthly fee and it will capture all of the cost according to what the final issuance for a bond in 2023.,50,,
470,0.97,2646.377,2656.453,Those some of the mechanics deal I already talked about the loan regarding the 2023 bond issuance.,50,,
471,0.97,2656.453,2660.691,This will be held to the city through a payment.,50,,
472,0.97,2660.691,2662.359,And then I will discuss risk enrichment items.,50,,
473,0.97,2662.359,2667.464,We work with to negotiate some of these deals are some of these items.,50,,
474,0.97,2667.464,2684.815,"One of the keys that we wanted to emphasize from the city side is that we wanted to establish a reserve so that the situation where missed a payment, we would have a back down.",50,,
475,0.97,2684.815,2685.449,Be a reserve.,50,,
476,0.97,2685.449,2687.718,That would be the equivalent of one your of the payments.,50,,
477,0.97,2687.718,2694.892,What needs to be made and it will be held by the city as well as a third-party.,50,,
478,0.97,2694.892,2703.067,"In the event that the city misses a payment, we draw that from the account.",50,,
479,0.97,2703.067,2706.303,We have also established a corrective action plan with in the Rma.,50,,
480,0.97,2706.303,2708.572,It has been outlined regarding what the actions are within the city.,50,,
481,0.97,2708.572,2725.389,"So, the other item that discussed in the cities and part municipal parks district, it is that they will contribute $1.2 million.",50,,
482,0.97,2725.389,2727.224,These will be in order to maintain the facility.,50,,
483,0.97,2727.224,2743.34,"The situation that the Aquarium society their payments for an entire year, we will divert those payment payment of and essentially the debt service.",50,,
484,0.97,2743.34,2749.313,That gives us roughly 18 months to cure to figure out an action plan.,50,,
485,0.97,2749.313,2756.253,That is the worst possible case scenario.,50,,
486,0.97,2756.253,2759.957,Have been assured by the Aquarium society that they do not believe this will ever come to fruition.,50,,
487,0.97,2759.957,2762.226,We wanted to back up situation in case but it did.,50,,
488,0.97,2762.226,2763.494,We have seen more things happen.,50,,
489,0.97,2763.494,2766.296,That is kind of the structure of the deal.,50,,
490,0.97,2766.296,2775.906,We have also added an amendment to the funding agreement that says this is the city's last contribution to the project.,50,,
491,0.97,2775.906,2781.411,"That is another item that we have A. so, that is kind of the main structure of the deal.",50,,
492,0.97,2781.411,2787.985,"The proposed legislation, that is what we are proposing today.",50,,
493,0.97,2787.985,2797.628,Is to amend the funding agreement and then deals with authorized loan when increasing the appropriations.,50,,
494,0.97,2797.628,2800.23,"Councilmember Herbold, do you have any questions",50,,
495,0.97,2800.23,2804.968,It is okay with the chair?,51,,
496,0.97,2804.968,2807.004,The chair is out of the room currently.,52,,
497,0.97,2807.004,2811.708,"Councilmember Tran or, I think that has become the chair.",52,,
498,0.97,2811.708,2816.213,"I am the chair, thank you so much.",53,,
499,0.97,2816.213,2821.552,I appreciate the opportunity answer questions.,53,,
500,0.97,2821.552,2837.601,I appreciate the explanation of aid and the city's interest in helping address and effort to really manage what is anticipated to be a short-term loan.,53,,
501,0.97,2837.601,2848.045,"On this slide, there are references establishing a corrective action plan or missed a payment.",53,,
502,0.97,2848.045,2858.255,We also talked about strategy of using annual Fund and by the municipal parks district.,53,,
503,0.97,2858.255,2864.228,This is for the fee payment.,53,,
504,0.97,2864.228,2896.86,"Are you saying that there will be, there has yet to be developed a corrective action plan and until that is developed, we will be using the expectation that we would use Npd to repay the debt service.",53,,
505,0.97,2896.86,2899.396,This is in the interim while we are developing a corrective plan.,53,,
506,0.97,2899.396,2899.93,Is that accurate?,53,,
507,0.97,2899.93,2903.6,Speak a little bit more about that?,53,,
508,0.97,2903.6,2914.244,Speak in more detail about how the concept of a corrective action plan is memorialized in the legislation?,53,,
509,0.97,2914.244,2920.817,The corrective action plan will go into effect as an agrarian society pays anything.,54,,
510,0.97,2920.817,2925.756,"Emac does it exist, that is what I am asking first, does a corrective action plan already exists?",54,,
511,0.97,2925.756,2930.594,Emac the steps in test.,54,,
512,0.97,2930.594,2939.836,"We work with the Aquarium society to develop a full and regarding replenishment in the case, again, it deals with the timing.",54,,
513,0.97,2939.836,2942.306,This is according to their cash flow.,54,,
514,0.97,2942.306,2948.478,"Oh yes, the amendment was the criterion.",54,,
515,0.97,2948.478,2954.551,"So, the corrective action plan is something more than you saying Npd funding to pay debt payments.",55,,
516,0.97,2954.551,2957.554,Can you talk a little bit more about what the corrective action and it?,55,,
517,0.97,2957.554,2970.701,The corrective action plan is to work with the cities in order to look at their financial situation.,56,,
518,0.97,2970.701,2972.536,With the budget and the forecast for the future.,56,,
519,0.97,2972.536,2979.042,One thing we have actually emphasized is that they may have a capital budget.,56,,
520,0.97,2979.042,2989.92,We told them that the entirety of the financial tuition of the Aquarium society is responsible for the payment.,56,,
521,0.97,2989.92,2991.989,They are kind of isolating it within the construction budget.,56,,

523,0.97,2998.929,3005.402,We work with them to evaluate the finances and determine what we can do in order to get those payment,56,,

529,0.97,3021.785,3035.065,"I wanted to know if staff had any, about the $20 million the before I launch into any questions",57,,
530,0.97,3035.065,3037.267,"Hello, good morning.",58,,
531,0.97,3037.267,3038.935,I am with central staff.,58,,
532,0.97,3038.935,3048.345,I do not have a lot to add that would eliminate more than what has been presented by Marshall and Caleb.,58,,
533,0.97,3048.345,3055.585,I will say that the $20 million request in the Roseville to all problems that were unexpected.,58,,
534,0.97,3055.585,3060.857,"The folks involved, I think it is a problem that they wanted to solve it.",58,,
535,0.97,3060.857,3064.761,We have scoped out the risk that have Reticulated here.,58,,
536,0.97,3064.761,3069.666,We recognize that the risk exists.,58,,
537,0.97,3069.666,3076.506,"We also recognize that there is a history of legislation, decisions by the Mayor and Council to integrate these projects.",58,,
538,0.97,3076.506,3079.943,There is a real possibility without a delay for any reason.,58,,
539,0.97,3079.943,3083.647,The ocean pavilion could delay various project the city is pursuing.,58,,
540,0.97,3083.647,3085.449,Those are real things.,58,,
541,0.97,3085.449,3091.988,The other thing to note that I think it is sort of a nuts and bolts item.,58,,
542,0.97,3091.988,3094.791,It is key to understanding the legislation.,58,,
543,0.97,3094.791,3099.129,They are presented to separate pieces legislation.,58,,
544,0.97,3099.129,3109.539,Because there is a saying that a bill used to cover a single subject.,58,,
545,0.97,3109.539,3112.976,So one subject has to deal with loan and the pieces that involve various on the not peace.,58,,
546,0.97,3112.976,3114.845,This is what Caleb described.,58,,
547,0.97,3114.845,3121.585,Another subject deals with amending the agreement.,58,,
548,0.97,3121.585,3122.586,They appear as separate bills.,58,,
549,0.97,3122.586,3130.794,"There have been some good questions related to that about you know, should there be some Connectivity or Intimacies between the two.",58,,
550,0.97,3130.794,3153.95,"I just wanted to point out that if have this very good role for clarity to make things transparent, if we looked at this will by a single subject, this could be presented as a single bill to you all.",58,,
551,0.97,3153.95,3157.621,The reason it is in a separate bill is I wanted to pointed out that they go together.,58,,
552,0.97,3157.621,3159.456,Passing one means passing the other and vice versa.,58,,
553,0.97,3159.456,3161.124,"And so, Councilmember Peterson, thank you for reflecting.",58,,
554,0.97,3161.124,3163.56,"To answer your resting, we want to's is in this technical detail.",58,,
555,0.97,3163.56,3170.767,I think this is important to deliberation regarding the approval.,58,,
556,0.97,3170.767,3173.303,"To Recap, they appear as two separate bills but they go together.",58,,
557,0.97,3173.303,3177.641,The only reason they appear before you separately is because of the rules we had about each bill addressing a single subject.,58,,
558,0.97,3177.641,3178.241,Thank you.,59,,
559,0.97,3178.241,3182.312,I do have some follow-up questions.,59,,

563,0.97,3188.218,3193.557,If it is okay I wanted to ask if we could have the Aquarium team provides additional contact for the project budget and cash flow situation.,60,,
564,0.97,3193.557,3199.229,Would that be help before questions and answers?,60,,
565,0.97,3199.229,3200.23,"Yeah, that sounds great.",61,,
566,0.97,3200.23,3206.303,That we will go to count first.,61,,

588,0.97,3293.39,3305.835,"I think for many of us, the a project that is integrated with the main corridor, we are building a building of the Right-Of-Way.",62,,
589,0.97,3305.835,3315.111,"This is the building that houses over 400,000 gallon of water and it has a public open face on the top which is part of the waterfront related elements.",62,,
590,0.97,3315.111,3316.746,This is what we are delivering to the community.,62,,

593,0.97,3329.793,3332.262,The world I think has changed dramatically since that time.,62,,
594,0.97,3332.262,3336.099,That has created cost impact to the project.,62,,
595,0.97,3336.099,3339.769,It has added complex the.,62,,

597,0.97,3342.038,3345.775,"We did not anticipate the Five- month, strike.",62,,
598,0.97,3345.775,3353.55,We have overcome all of those challenges in this moment in order to solve timing issue as Marshall said.,62,,
599,0.97,3353.55,3358.188,This is especially from the private dollars.,62,,
600,0.97,3358.188,3365.929,"I would like to share a memo here, I will share my screen to get this to work.",62,,
601,0.97,3365.929,3376.473,Hopefully you can all see this.,62,,
602,0.97,3381.144,3381.478,All right.,62,,

607,0.97,3403.767,3406.336,There is a team embedded with the project team for several years.,62,,
608,0.97,3406.336,3409.506,We are reaching four of the highest level of sustainable certification in the nation.,62,,
609,0.97,3409.506,3414.711,This will be the first Aquarium that get that certification.,62,,
610,0.97,3414.711,3421.584,So we are leading on that front.,62,,
611,0.97,3421.584,3422.585,Lots more details.,62,,
612,0.97,3422.585,3425.688,I know we had a great briefing with Councilmember Lewis's committee a few weeks ago.,62,,
613,0.97,3425.688,3427.724,I would like to talk about the market conditions.,62,,
614,0.97,3427.724,3429.125,I would like to discuss the primary drivers.,62,,
615,0.97,3429.125,3430.994,It is important to understand that there has cost.,62,,
616,0.97,3430.994,3437.5,There is big reason for that.,62,,
617,0.97,3437.5,3440.904,"Early on in the project in May 2019, we looked at a couple of additional Inestment.",62,,
618,0.97,3440.904,3442.138,One raise the bar for Sustainability.,62,,
619,0.97,3442.138,3453.216,It deals with invest in a efficient building I am looking at Marshall Forester and we assumed the responsibility for delivering the rooftop public open.,62,,
620,0.97,3453.216,3457.12,In late 2019 we had a much better sense of what that total cost was.,62,,
621,0.97,3457.12,3461.424,We also had a number of local line items related cost.,62,,
622,0.97,3461.424,3470.567,"There was overhead dancing, support for the philanthropic campaign as well as an outside animal center.",62,,
623,0.97,3470.567,3472.802,This was brought into the fold for the total project amount.,62,,
624,0.97,3472.802,3474.637,This was the first level of his.,62,,
625,0.97,3474.637,3476.706,That the pandemic hit.,62,,
626,0.97,3476.706,3484.247,That caused a number of challenges and project delivery and the cost.,62,,
627,0.97,3484.247,3493.89,"I think we are all familiar with national Supply-Chain shortages, cost increases, economic uncertainty and all of those.",62,,
628,0.97,3493.89,3494.691,Impacted the overall project.,62,,
629,0.97,3494.691,3498.194,We were able to navigate through all of that.,62,,
630,0.97,3498.194,3502.732,We were able to navigate through the concrete strike fairly successfully.,62,,
631,0.97,3502.732,3515.945,"We have a timing challenge for the initial funds we need a little bit more time to get there . again, great success on that front to date.",62,,
632,0.97,3515.945,3517.213,In the pandemic it is tough.,62,,
633,0.97,3517.213,3520.049,Now that we are back in person we are meeting with all of that.,62,,
634,0.97,3520.049,3524.888,It is accelerated again but we need help with this.,62,,
635,0.97,3524.888,3533.696,"Just a quick note, I am happy to send this memo out to the committee as background, exhaustive efforts on cost control; we are looking at every facet of the object.",62,,
636,0.97,3533.696,3540.003,How can we best sure pricing?,62,,
637,0.97,3540.003,3550.246,How can we work with all of the Subcontractors to ensure we are delivering the highest value?,62,,
638,0.97,3550.246,3552.115,This is to the Aquarium and to the public.,62,,
639,0.97,3552.115,3558.254,"We want to test all key components of the program to ensure that everything that is in the building, on top of the building is delivering to that core mission.",62,,
640,0.97,3558.254,3562.592,At the bottom there is a summary of the changes from 19- 20.,62,,
641,0.97,3562.592,3568.698,"This is a number that includes all those little line cost, it was a $140 million project that time.",62,,
642,0.97,3568.698,3570.099,Construction was around 105.,62,,
643,0.97,3570.099,3583.246,Than the increase the we saw in 2021 is that we got a good handle the impacts what was projected as ongoing challenges to the completion of the project.,62,,
644,0.97,3583.246,3584.414,Setting construction budget by 10%.,62,,
645,0.97,3584.414,3587.717,You can the that.,62,,
646,0.97,3587.717,3593.656,That includes tax and content.,62,,
647,0.97,3593.656,3600.229,We also saw an increase in the tax.,62,,
648,0.97,3600.229,3605.435,"So, this is not an insignificant amount, $100 million in construction effort.",62,,
649,0.97,3605.435,3614.377,We saw an increase in letter and letter E-Services as well as the Lobar of the line cost.,62,,
650,0.97,3614.377,3616.045,This deals with restoration that extended the project.,62,,
651,0.97,3616.045,3618.915,We want to make sure we have continuity and integrity for the entire team.,62,,
652,0.97,3618.915,3620.216,We had a more significant investment.,62,,

654,0.97,3628.524,3641.604,"We brought in an expert, Jason Mclennan to do an audit of the overall design and get us to the level where we can achieve nation's leading certification.",62,,
655,0.97,3641.604,3643.873,"I know in the interest of time, I will pause there.",62,,
656,0.97,3643.873,3650.813,"If any of you are interested in going into the budget detail, and greater links, please let me know.",62,,
657,0.97,3650.813,3653.916,It takes about an hour to go through the full comprehensive logic budget.,62,,
658,0.97,3653.916,3655.551,And this deals with all of the backup.,62,,
659,0.97,3655.551,3658.388,Thank you.,63,,
660,0.97,3658.388,3664.894,"Member Peterson, you are first.",63,,

662,0.97,3665.962,3667.163,Thank you for being here today.,64,,
663,0.97,3667.163,3671.267,I will just go through all of my comments and questions to get them all out now.,64,,
664,0.97,3671.267,3680.51,"So, I know many people are excited about the pension of the Seattle Aquarium.",64,,
665,0.97,3680.51,3682.545,I am confident this project is going to get done.,64,,
666,0.97,3682.545,3685.214,I appreciate the hard work that has gone into the project thus far.,64,,
667,0.97,3685.214,3689.886,I like to provide a context for my management questions.,64,,
668,0.97,3689.886,3701.03,It deals with Reconnecting our city,64,,
669,0.97,3774.537,3776.506,We just saw part of that in this memo.,65,,
670,0.97,3776.506,3780.443,Thank you for showing on the screen.,65,,
671,0.97,3780.443,3785.314,"Back in December 2019, cost was 113 million.",65,,
672,0.97,3785.314,3795.791,"I am trying to understand how it went from 113,000,002 240 million.",65,,
673,0.97,3795.791,3800.096,What you showed on the screen was the difference between 140 million and 160 million.,65,,
674,0.97,3800.096,3802.365,That is the amount today for the total project cost.,65,,
675,0.97,3802.365,3814.21,"So, that is a 41% increase in just 30 months from the 113 million that we were told on December of 2019.",65,,
676,0.97,3814.21,3826.923,That leaves line of questioning about other option . I realize the project is integrated physically with other parts of the waterfront that are vital.,65,,
677,0.97,3826.923,3832.395,Why not for helpful all of the exterior part that are integrated?,65,,
678,0.97,3832.395,3836.732,"The roof, the stairwells of these are include.",65,,
679,0.97,3836.732,3850.012,And delay 20 million of the interior regarding improvements . that would only be 12% of the total project cost.,65,,
680,0.97,3850.012,3851.047,It would be 160 million.,65,,
681,0.97,3851.047,3863.392,This is if you just phase in the Interior to the shark tank or what ever it is a cost driver for your interior.,65,,
682,0.97,3863.392,3865.995,I really appreciate the debt policy management advisory committee going through this.,65,,
683,0.97,3865.995,3873.97,It is help to know that it complies with the rules for issuing debt.,65,,
684,0.97,3873.97,3875.571,I am wondering if there are other options.,65,,
685,0.97,3875.571,3884.347,It sounds like the requirements pretty confident in getting sources of repayment for the debt.,65,,
686,0.97,3884.347,3892.421,Combined.Com the government providing loan guarantees or something else.,65,,
687,0.97,3892.421,3906.002,Bank King County for some for the funding the bulk of the government those are my questions and comments far Mac thank you very much.,65,,

689,0.97,3907.27,3913.743,I would love to hear what folks have to say before we have Councilmember Lewis.,65,,
690,0.97,3913.743,3933.362,"In addition to Councilmember Peterson's line of concerned, if you could integrate into that what assurance you have built into this are baked it in order to make sure if there is any than the Aquarium, given the ability to pay this off, given uncertainty.",65,,
691,0.97,3933.362,3942.004,What assurances does the city have make sure that there is an Offramp if you will?,65,,
692,0.97,3942.004,3954.216,"My suggestion start by addressing 113-140, 160.",66,,
